What will he do? ČSSD in Prague doesn’t know Voldemort or the confectioner’s shop
The new city councilors from the ČSSD will probably have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and council.
The daily Aktuálně.cz "tried" the members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they know the notoriously established slang, which was created at the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political elite during the previous era of the Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not understand well-known terms.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, a cultural councillor, responded to the "Kmotrovský" test.
And although he is a political veteran, Councillor Karel Březina reacted similarly.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally accept slang."
The editorial team chose six examples from a glossary published by Aktuálně.cz this June before the ODS electoral congress, mainly those notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the patisserie", "bull's neck", "treason of the capital" and "to tin".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague's education in the future - first promised the interview, but later he did not answer the phone.
The fifth alderman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test.
"I don't care about these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how much fun the citizens' democrats are having."
"I'm now dealing with how we're going to understand each other within our programs," he responded.
As it has already been said, alderman Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the headline above that the talk is about an influential businessman and friend of the exprimator Bém Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucký and the only term he correctly guessed in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"That's Blanka's tunnel," says Kaucky, and immediately adds, "but I know it more from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he joked.
Not only matador Karel Březina, but also the environmental councilor Lukáš Plachý deciphers the golf hole as a Blanka tunnel.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachý is also familiar with where to find this figure - he knows the meaning of the expression "to go to the confectioner's shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague company," Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
According to Březina, he drew his knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In a social democracy, according to the test participants, there is no such familiar vocabulary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and distortions of names are used," says Petr Hulínský, the chairman of the ČSSD in Prague.
"I was called Birch in school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me Birch," admits Karel Březina.
The name has been tried and it works.
Alderman Weinert is for the party Děda or less friendly Dědek, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the election fraud in sponsoring the party, with some colleagues has the nickname "Igáček".
Nicknames are also the only thing that social democrats allow in intra-party speech.
Hulínský reportedly does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Aktuálně.cz recorded another nickname of this Prague chairman.
"Doctor of baton law" is said to remind that Petr Hulínský received his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a booklet
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common characteristics.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot engage in work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
The one who "becomes a witch" is sent into isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is seldom met."
“Young healthy women do not move away either, because they help with work and give birth to children,” describes the nun who takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She has published an information booklet to help curb the witch hunt.
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper Die Standard said.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured kerosene and set her on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
On the woman, according to their version, the oil was ignited, which is used for ritual anointing.
The fire broke out after the group tried to “expel the evil spirit” from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger," he said.
In Burkina Faso, while the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, the president himself took part in it last year.
"After his aunt's death, Gambian President Jammi unleashed a massive witch hunt that was supposed to have been involved in her death and tried to use black magic to kill the president himself."
"He enlisted the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's personal security, forcibly escorted randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, trapped people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which additionally caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bakal's tenant: Heating in the stove, higher rent signed
An older, stocky man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Byty "uhlobaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, he carried a file with new leases to three apartments: his own, his daughter’s, and his son, who is serving his sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for all three.
Instead of 3500 per month from next year, the son will pay CZK 4100 for the second category apartment 2+1.
"And there is no hot water, and the petrama must be heated," the man points his finger at his son's new contract, for which he has power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which has described the new lease terms as "incorrect and indecent", advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until December 7 when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waved his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic are waiting.
So I decided to visit the “laboratory” in person.
The Havířov RPG waiting room is one of four in the Ostrava region and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Next to the door is a security guard from the security agency with a summoning device.
"Rent 2011", lit a special button on its touch screen.
One tap and a number slips out of the machine.
You won't even be able to read "157" and your number is already beeping on the large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
It's your turn in half a second.
After a while, an elderly couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not concern new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims, and the like.
Letters with new leases have been sent to the mailboxes of most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio since mid-November.
In their letters, RPG Flats proposes to increase their rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's been running for a week, so it's only in the running," the workers behind the counter answer after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of the parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD took it quite loudly, and even now the local newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
“They didn’t even change my toilet seat,” the man said.
Most of the time, according to the workers, pensioners come to see if they will get a discount from the rent if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
A half discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
But the "deregulation" partition in Havířov is definitely not overloaded with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 people were here for the 2011 lease," the workers behind the counter estimated.
On the web and in its bulletin boards, the RPG suggests individual contracting where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG warns on its website.
"No one will judge here," thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty, and the man on the street in front of the client center partially agrees with her.
“I have $13,000 in my pension, and I have $5,000 left to eat, and I don’t have the money to sue,” he said.
However, the worker is soon in doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
Rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach even the amount necessary for simple maintenance of the housing stock," reminds Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the neglect of the housing stock reproached by the angry tenant is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to homeowners.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats several red highlighted information.
"The rent increase in 2011 of 15% or less applies to 31,200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," he appears on the screen.
With only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, rents will increase by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is an increase from the extremely low amount of 19.66 CZK per square meter," warns the RPG.
With 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) will give the company back to the apartments, mainly to the thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
They should be given priority by people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect that it also hides a mini-school with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
Design-architectural company Arch.Design, from whose studios came a number of important Brno buildings, counted on space for its company mini-school from the very first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of babyboom, and it was important for women designers and architects to be able to return to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of a social program.
Stavarky and architects have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with child care.
The mini-school was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of the management they managed to get a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (a subsidy of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and ensure qualified staff and operation for two years.
After exhausting the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to run the mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and Economy Rating significantly helped with the application.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are taken care of all day by a nurse and kindergarten teacher, so children without age limit can go to kindergarten, yet most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day there are more.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic cognition to preparation for school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and there are no stressful situations with delayed picking up of children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors by Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house has earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house plays out dreamy lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
Detailed observation shows geometry, rhythm and a well-thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the brilliance of colors is even more enhanced.
The twisting and twisting of shapes appears equally in interiors.
Wood in the waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepholes and moldings.
House Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper redevelopment.
Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
It was designed by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaic on the facade.
A number of other creators and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of Casa Batlló started the successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá and Park Guell, which contains Gaudí’s other works.
From the locals, the house soon after completion earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call it "the yawning house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed for his time a unique central heating system with vents and typical chimneys.
Their forty-five degree inclination may seem bizarre.
When creating Gaudí absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not let himself be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later the city council was horrified by the result and asked for correction.
For example, it bothered the councilors that the building also interfered with the pillars in the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only fifteen days after the city district’s appeal, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) a permit to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a social salon and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented a jewelry store.
The whole six-storey house intersects the stairs, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the redevelopment were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors, and the larger company can communicate with each other comfortably without retaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations at the same time.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also received an unconventional roofing and two additional floors.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is lined, and skylights.
The game of two colors adds maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and spectacular apartment open to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed with the tours because they found it to be a very profitable business and in addition, they expanded the tours to include common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes have a 20% discount.
The amount far exceeds the price of admission to Gaudí's other buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you need to quickly make friends with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it right at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: women have different requirements than men
Not a flashy bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface, that is, mattresses and grate, give the basis for a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, a lot of things decide, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which mattresses and grate are purchased.
Typical example?
For example, on weekend cottages, where it is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they heat up more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be turned around regularly.
If they do not have a lot of vents in the core, and they are still on a solid board, they retain moisture: Mold could also appear under them.
The choice is also made by habit.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"I think all the hockey players who were coming back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"For their battered shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they do not receive "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers, were looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's okay, suitable mattresses have Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL player to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There is no pressure, you will not roll over at night like after a hard match.
You'll just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
Both a man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent in your elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, a guildmaster of the Association of Upholsterers and Decorators, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures it at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grid and mattress, but here, be careful when buying to align the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not be able to do this with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shaping and loosening layer.
"When touching your hands or sitting on the mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
Upholstered beds, when the mattress and the base are like conjoined Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses do not ventilate well, you can not wash their cover, which is already common today.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has its ale.
That’s why we offer practical advice from sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up hygiene and washable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are commonly produced today with zippers around the perimeter, so after opening we get two parts (very important for washing and washing machine size!), yet handling in larger types (and one person) while shooting could resemble a light weight fight in the ring with a heavy one.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grid?
Never!
Maximum for a one-night stay.
However, provide the plate (if it does not already have them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a loosening layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a substrate.
For non-positioning slats with 14 to 18 slats, latex or sandwich mattresses will be suitable (for example, a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always pay for slats with more slats, 28 or more, where the slats in the lumbar area are doubled and their rigidity can be regulated.
The positioning lamella grids do not include spring-framed mattresses, as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, you can also indulge in the so-called shoulder cradle.
This is a special slat mount that allows you to push or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder sleeps nicely "damaged".
For men who have "shoulders over their whole back", definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by manufacturers of mattresses, who in the "men's" began to use the softening zone just in the shoulder area.
Women are also remembered - they in turn give a softer surface in the places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate grids with so-called multi-torque suspension.
The pressure decomposes into multiple points and the tension decreases.
However, be careful, as soon as you apply the wrong pillow on the right mattress and grate (large and "stuffed"), most of the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and only reach the shoulders with the tips so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should align (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straws filled with grass.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
It is also a trend in mattresses.
Raw materials from oil, from which polyurethane foams are made, are replaced with natural oils, for example, from jumper and soy.
Soybeans are used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division between men and women.
While a man "cools" the plant extract from the birch tree, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women, on the contrary, the covers "melt".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with broken cell structure, it is more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
Combining different stiffnesses of cold foams and "lazy" foams, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where the head, hips and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters have a lower VAT rate, they are taken as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with memory foam sewn into the cover for CZK 11,990.
The second one can be bought for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density was started by the "cosmic" Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, because during the launches, the astronauts were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur softens in the heat, while it hardens in the cold.
The warm human body adapts and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against bedsores, but also for increased comfort when sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which lighten the legs and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and the like.
More and more parents want to monitor their children
Fear for your own child is driving more and more people to the idea of watching over GPS.
The system originally created for searching for cars can also track the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is about as big as a matchbox, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and began to search for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy will happen," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices can be misused, for example when they are put in the bag of someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
“For the most part, customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” added Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is used and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear something like this, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children are very creative in how they intentionally lose things when they don’t want to be in control.”
"High expectations were previously raised by parents' mobile phones, which can be turned off just like these tracking devices," Bočková said.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the abduction is concerned, the perpetrator will virtually always ensure that the child does not carry any electronics that could reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When tracking devices start to expand, they will look for them as well, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of an unexpected attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after the attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to periodically send location after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last location of the person concerned will be available."
"More expensive devices have built-in tiltometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained motionless, the device will immediately send a warning with an indication of position," says Čech.
According to him, a similar service can also be taken by smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are either matchbox-sized devices or smaller mobile phones.
They are always at risk of losing it.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, the device is now being tested as a regular digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that a potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he will recognize them after some time and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the trackers develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to monitor cars.
It is a combination of GPS location detection (which uses conventional car navigation) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would envelop the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of lines, which are used to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of lines to the warehouses.
The army has 225 years of supplies.
The problem is that the shelf life of the cords is two, maximum four years.
The army bought the incendiary cords from the joint stock company STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff in the rationale for the purchase of such a huge number of MF DNES incendiary cords wrote off that soldiers use 60 kilometers of incendiaries per year during training.
However, according to the calculations of military pyrotechnics, which the MF DNES addressed, all generals, army command officers, secretaries and cleaners would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick included.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of fuses.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army's stockpile would last for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it was true that for the basic training of each new professional only two meters of the incendiary cord is enough, as experts say, then the army purchased fresh supplies - even with increased consumption of engineer or special units - for the aforementioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra recently that they have almost no small arms ammunition, so the shootings are also limited due to the lack of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't bother me that they repeatedly buy such a large number of fuses from us."
"But it's their decision and they know what they're going to do with it."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we try to satisfy as traders," says Jan Děcký, business manager of STV Group.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek also explained that the army will have supplies of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from STV Group, however, speaks only about the four-year life of the incendiary and police or army pyrotechnics even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish his name because of the criticism of the army.
At the end of its life, each munition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is the quantity discount for 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," Pejšek's spokesman said.
By way of comparison, the annual consumption of the firing lines of the World War II-era or Soviet-era bomb squad has not exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order only enough to consume this ammunition before the end of its life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also more flexibly obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable difficulties with the destruction of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
The Czech Republic, according to the bomb squad that MF DNES approached, is facing the same problem in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old incendiaries, which today "cheaply" buys.
To this day, I draw on the contacts I have gained through the competition.
Lukáš Pytloun was the winner of the Tradesman of the Year competition when he sold his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year’s Tradesman of the Year competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
From savings from foreign brigades and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a semi-demolished house with five apartments.
Being a third-year college student at the time was a big deal.
"At that time, the ratio between the quality and price of accommodation in our country did not allow me to try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
All profits were invested back in the house, which was gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another one of the same quality was added to it.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisá, where we sold our franchise concept and other people interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting," says last year's sole trader.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel was largely due to the victory in the Tradesman of the Year competition," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater recognition and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, they often congratulated me and I have to say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is strongly recommended to everyone who is trying something.
There is no need to win, all visibility is good.
He says that he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have been able to get to.
"I started doing business regularly with some of the people I met through the competition."
The fame associated with success, according to him, fell somewhat on every employee.
He has about 70 of them.
"I see more loyalty and pride in being involved in something that has gained widespread recognition."
“It’s not just my personal success, it’s the result of all of us working well together.”
"Only my name is brought to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the winner’s determination, Farmet has had worse times behind him.
Last year’s prize for the first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition went to the owner of the Farmet company, Karel Zdarsky.
The jury appreciated the effort, through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnover from a small tool shop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and raised our confidence for the match against the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karel Zdarsky’s father a small workshop to rent as compensation for the Communist confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father they founded a company on plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the unprofessional public, the company gained greater awareness after achieving success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers started to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they cooperate with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Zdarsky.
However, the past year has not been in Farmet only in the sign of euphoria of victory.
The award was based on the company’s financial results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis, which had not yet affected citizens so much, was climaxing, but companies were already halting their investment projects and starting to restrict the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us either."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were also redundancies," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable company must sometimes be able to make such unpopular arrangements.
However, they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
However, what has not been discounted in Farmet is the investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training center from the subsidies, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next edition of the Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
This was decided by more than a third of the less than four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, this will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register for checks on insurance payers," ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová said.
To shine a light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to repeal the nonsensical ones, is the meaning of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth time this year that it has been part of a business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny and is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If last year there were about 3,000 voters, this year there were nearly 4,000.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations that serve only to delay business, there is still enough and enough.
"For example, in the number of sheets for tax returns, we are the leading companies in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and runs according to the same script every year.
Anyone can register administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the deadline is the competition.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anticena" and let the public vote on it via the Internet during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations have been entered into this year’s survey.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, among the nominees was, for example, the requirement that cars for the maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
This year’s list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by political and social figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, assisted in this climax of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws entrepreneurs underfoot, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Attempts to overturn meaningless regulations are not in vain.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the entrepreneur’s obligation to report three days in advance to the trade licensing office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand for an exhibition or a fair.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report the Labour Office for its foreign employee business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two tread scales in the office.
This was eased this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator dropped.
The new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
The category Responsible Company of the Year 2010 is a novelty in this year’s fifth edition of the competition of Hospodářské noviny.
The aim of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebel of the year competition.
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 was entered by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish on a separate article.
Although the subject of their activity differs diametrically from each other, the common denominator of their efforts can be considered support and consideration.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their employees.
For example, the Prague software company Et Netera was among the fourteen finalists, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then take part in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the foundation fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
In turn, the paper mill from Poděbrady takes care of its disabled employees, which has more than 70 percent of them, which is why it received the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and was ranked third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing flexible working hours, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
She was also awarded the title by the jury for buying from Czech manufacturers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment," explains Managing Director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region thinks about the health of its employees and has bought ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each notebook, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Romani community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of above-standard bonuses.
"In turn, we make contributions to food, transport, improving qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Czach construction company in Brno, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly filled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to register for this competition alone, because it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose organizing agency.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
Detectives used handcuffs for a local media entrepreneur and real estate trader Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public tender to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the tender would attract specific bidders.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for a misdemeanor in a public contract and in a public competition," said the head of the Plzeň Public Prosecutor's Office, Antonie Zelená, adding that further details cannot be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old was released after 24 hours.
One can only speculate about how it might have influenced the public competition, given the minimum of official information.
A spokesperson for the Land Fund, Lubomír Černá, said that police officers were indeed arrested at a remote workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to Černá, the tender has the correct title "Call for submission of a bid for land transfer rights under the Land Act" and takes place if more eligible applicants are interested in the offered land.
"As part of the call, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined, and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who applied for the call, and since he is also a beneficiary, having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the land to the interested party that he would not participate in the competition.
He probably got a severance pay for it.
That would explain why he had such a large amount of money in his possession.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts at the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution for which a decision on the location of the building had already been made.
It was at that time that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later it was very advantageously exchanged with the municipality for a house in the very historic center of the city, which had a value much higher.
At that time, the town hall had to accept it, because otherwise it would endanger the building by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds of dollars a month
From January, households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heat supply and rents will grow somewhere.
Families will have to withdraw up to hundreds of crowns a month from their wallets from January.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, you will have to pay up to a tenth more in some cities for water supplies and in many cases also for central heat supplies.
The electricity bill should cost households 100 crowns a year than it does now.
At the same time, electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so the significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas costs slightly, but at a time when people are drowning the most and have the highest consumption.
They also have to pay hundreds of dollars extra each year.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive throughout the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 extra per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than CZK 1,000 per year.
Prague’s residents are at risk of being more than 9% more expensive with water and sewerage if the city increases the rent on infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, you will pay 6.8% more.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower ones in the national comparison.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage costs are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, rents may rise significantly in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulations have been ending since January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new amount of rent are going to take the company to court.
Regulated rents, which are paid by people in about 300,000 apartments, could increase by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally and better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often end up in the care of doctors by drunkards who are not even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are repeatedly treated in the hospital.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the incomes of children's wards of hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk with them.”
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, the head of the children's department of the Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Právo.
"If they manage to take the bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's like whiskey, but otherwise fernet and vodka prevail."
"Water has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and it doesn't smell so much," he explained.
And the spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital Eva Jurinová also proves him right.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was plum brandy they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to Pelikán, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers in hospital are a relatively common phenomenon.
Prior to Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances are tying up schoolchildren from a wide range of backgrounds.
"There was a girl who lay with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with 3.5 per mille of extra alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the fairgrounds in Holešovice for some dance party."
“It’s interesting that her mother didn’t find it strange that she didn’t know about her daughter for 48 hours,” he said.
It is the indifference of parents, or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring, that is considered to be the main cause of growing childhood drunkenness.
Dependence in the true sense of the word, however, according to experts, can not be talked about in children.
“Alcoholism is defined as chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena that are associated with it, and this is not the case in children.”
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, the family-social background is rather symptomatic," Pelikán explained.
According to a spokeswoman, Jurinová hospitalized about forty drunk children at a pediatric clinic in Motol until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication that had to stay in the hospital will be included in the statistics.
Child drunkards who are taken by their parents after outpatient treatment, or brought home by the police, do not count.
Except when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: the witch, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year, according to Pelican.
"They either mourn the bad report card or celebrate the start of the holidays."
"Of course, I experienced seven drunken children at the same time," said Pelikán.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will drive away the irrigation infusion with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better off because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts."
"Only they are confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, adding that sometimes they spoil patients' pleasant mood at least by listing the costs that their treatment required.
Carriage by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education, when I was directly calculating on the visitation of those children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on a brigade to earn for that one party," added Pelikán.
However, health insurance companies do not take recourse proceedings in which parents would recover the costs of treatment in cases of child drunkards.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the Casa - EADS aircraft manufacturer is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercises or demonstration years.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was previously operated by the Czech Army and which was airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159s.
They are still preserved in Aero Vodochody and the broker of the store - Omnipol - took over them last week.
According to Jan Pejšek from the Defence Press Department, when the aircraft will be physically dispatched from Vodochod is not yet known.
"The single-seat L-159 aircraft for the exchange were set aside from the long-term stored aircraft, without additional deposits and investments by the ministry."
"The two-seater L-159T1 was changed in its current state and form," Právo Pejšek said.
He added that the army would not remain without two-seaters, because the ministry signed a contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns to convert four unnecessary L-159 aircraft into two two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, while the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has pledged to put the aircraft into service of an alliance country.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the customer how he will implement this thing," Pejšek said.
Hospodářské noviny recently reported that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not open a tender for the purchase and contacted EADS directly.
The defence leadership of the time argued that it would encourage future exports of L-159s abroad in exchange.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably also have a court settlement.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it was supposed to select aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than a ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than their ring finger are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially when combined with genetic risk or other risk factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the participants in the study had an index finger on their right hand that was shorter than a ring finger.
They had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, for those with an index finger longer than their ring finger, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men under 60, the risk dropped by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone promotes the growth of prostate cancer.
Professor Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told the Czech News Agency that he was familiar with the study, but did not believe that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
There is mostly snow on the roads and sidewalks, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was told by the dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed on the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided on the 93rd kilometer, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno on the 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then drive on the 182th kilometer on Kývalka.
There are several kilometers of traffic.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right on arrival in Prague.
There is a layer of snow in Prague, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car colonies are created, for example, in Prosek, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff is to sit again.
Railways and airports are also struggling.
Czech railways have already had to cancel seven high-speed trains due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11am to 5am on Wednesday.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
In the Vyškov region, three side roads are impassable, in the Brno region snow tongues are sometimes formed, and in the Blanen region snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in the higher places.
One of the most affected areas was the Vyškov region.
So far there are closed roads: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
It will be necessary to use cutters to stretch them.
When they will be released can not be estimated yet.
In Hodonín, caution is needed in the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained only by inert sprinkles to protect nature, lies up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, ČTK reported.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most of it in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually coming to an end.
U.S. Military Has a New “Smart Weapon”
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a small super-precision gun.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special 25 mm rounds, developed for this rifle and containing a high-explosive explosive, actually work like small grenades.
The cartridges can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point in its ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, and when a deadly rain of steel fragments falls on it, it can knock it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"In principle, the soldier treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to him, which determines the distance, so he gets a specified intentional point, adjusts the direction and presses the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"If you pull the trigger, the weapon will charge and fire at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu will move its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the current administrative building on Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
On Wednesday, the computer and maintenance giant said it would move 400 men and women from its current office building in the Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad, in July next year.
A spokesperson for Fujistu said another 100 jobs, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The lease offer was said to be very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the working style of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only leased.
Competent managing director Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure".
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important enterprise within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), a leading economic officer in Frankfurt, said that he was able to win a "global player".
He said it was a "fantastic demonstration of trust in the area."
Fujitsu is said to be fit for the city, settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The company was informed in good time of the company’s intentions.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader-square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is a matter of avoiding a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus-square, which until now had been used by Fujitsu, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were, together with the other buildings on the Marienbader-square, among the most discussed building projects of the spa town ten years ago.
Between the station and the town hall, the so-called urban entree was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer, which was criticized both because of the massive development of areas that previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, which was then associated with Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Fujitsu, a Tokyo-based company, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine and Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has the largest number of employees in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad; other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
7,000 square meters were leased in the Astro Park office building for this purpose.
The complex - its name draws attention to the star-shaped floor plan, which is twenty years old, houses among others also the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is in trouble.
Amazon has shut down its detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened due to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly in the UK.
Wikileaks, the platform for detection, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their home server in America and are now searching for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, is supposed to be staying, according to one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," activists posted on Twitter's short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, Amazon had downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic cables in order to handle the high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's associates conducted a search, CNN reported.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I used to wish Amazon had taken this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, outrageously and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and putting life on the planet at risk," a non-partisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute the stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted.
Based on a report in the London-based newspaper The Independent, a 39-year-old Australian in the UK is said to know the exact location.
An internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were also threats.
"There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In the U.S., the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, said on television - ironically, perhaps, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "targeted aircraft".
Meanwhile, a verbal shootout broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently published spy calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databanks.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed as special envoy.
Travers became responsible for the development of the "necessary reforms in the structure" that are necessary after the posting of messages from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger because of the publication on Wikileaks.
"We did everything we could to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
Ice Cream University
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a little outdated ice cream maker, makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes the ice cream from the cooler with a spatula, wipes it in the wafer and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But those who want to learn more about ice cream can not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer established an ice cream university to make ice cream from his machines conform to high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and a practice in our own ice cream parlor.
Someone in his Midlife-Crisis yearns for a new career, others venture on the thin ice of his vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a good dose of romance."
The first step in production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns the tap on the machine and a pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream, flows out.
Immediately, the docent is riddled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" probably used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will collide and the customer eats all the ice grains.
Some variations of the basic matter are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Supplier will try to force a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
“You should just experiment.”
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream made of white base mass, which turns eggs into a yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the participants can take part in the course with ice cream machines.
Luciano always has them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
It’s only when the mixture is balanced that Gelato tastes right, Luciano says.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano takes out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the vines measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the automatic production of basic matter that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously stirs the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we cannot avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo soils himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in Double Light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts called Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Christoph Then, CEO of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract to the Ilsi lobbying union for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in Efsa’s control regulations for genetic plants, and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, he criticizes Then.
Efsa's regulations are said to coincide in whole paragraphs with Ilsi's documents, thus bearing the industry's handwriting, which should be checked by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has highlighted a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa switched to the Swiss agrarian concern Syngenta without any additions or transitional periods - and thus changed sides.
Radio Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the EU's personnel link to the industrial lobby, which has attracted interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MPs.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Professionals working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with industry.
But he must prove them.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts in science, industry, and politics - among other things, for estimating the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically altered plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt at feeding, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically altered corn will do in the field,” says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, how can they be found?" asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching gentech since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the USA, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected with corporations.
Studies that are critical to companies are usually not published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he stood outside the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When the construction came to a halt, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
It is said: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When he cut one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near T?bingen on the former deposit of ammunition of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all that was created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappeared into the depot," he says in his office, a wooden hut that was formerly a guard house.
He relates that they scolded him and threatened him when in September it was reported in all newspapers that he had bought the remnants of the north wing from a company carrying out demolition.
But he talked to the S-21's opponents all day.
He explained that he was not responsible for the demolition.
And when this happens, it is the most sensible thing to do if the stones are still being used.
Then took about 200 S-21-opponents each one about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope to return it during re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long since been sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and towed what could fit in the trunk and on the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute long ago turned into "walls" or as the edges of flower beds with herbs.
“This stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political stuff."
He gets into his off-road car and goes for a ride in his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, then biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones.
He brings his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone merchant in the republic.
He's braking.
In the snow lie artistically worked sandstones.
“Once they belonged on the Marien-Bridge in Dresden,” he says.
Sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My favorite stone."
We continue on our way up through the forest.
It points to a pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once upon a time, the blocks belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Stones and stories lie everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were broken by hand and transported with simple hoists and bull carriages, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be crushed."
He did not become rich, not very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who appreciates the leftovers.
He should be in Cologne soon.
Stones will also be saved.
The Battle for High-Potentials
There are a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students are pressed for salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they will talk about the car of the future - and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, just like VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: To recruit the most talented graduates in the auditorium as soon as possible, before they reach the job market and are interested in them by others.
Since universities do not publish any lists of their students’ success, companies are trying to discover and acquire exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company is trying to acquire talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department gives away pens, rubber teddy bears and VW logo plates.
He tells promising young talents about apprenticeship programs, student jobs and suggests ways to join the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be useful as a co-worker."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that they are so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a substantial professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates will be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a long line of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and attract particularly highly skilled workers.
First of all, graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the VDI, 40,000 engineering positions were vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the shortage of engineers will grow even more.
The audit and consulting firm KPMG is headed by Roman Dykta for talent hunting.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the U.S. next year.
Participants can also view KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only the Creme de la Creme will fly to the USA.
In the fight for High Potentials in universities, according to the Dictate, there will be increasingly tougher laws.
“We want to be different with our race.”
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like the Dictator's talent hunter is in luck.
"We have been in contact with all participants of a similar event in the past year."
“Some of them are going to graduate soon and plan to apply for jobs with us,” he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically on the labor markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“Like at Intersolar,” says Sitha Stobe, head of personnel at Solarworld, a solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
He knows the issues with young people.
There are currently 35 positions listed on the company’s website.
"Right now, it's difficult to fill vacancies."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do a practicum or write a thesis."
A solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract with other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Large companies often can't offer this," says the head of the personal department of St?be.
Money has not played a major role in job search for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good progress options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in one Great Place to Work study.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and monitors the employees’ framework conditions.
The head of the personal department of St?be hopes that the placement will bring her points to the job seekers.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, first of all, internal action.
“The best way to become visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. putting an employer on the market within their own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with a string," Kriegler says.
Obama to stop new oil drilling
In the coming years, there will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - and thereby definitively overturned earlier plans.
New drilling is also prohibited on the Atlantic coast.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling tower in April.
Ahead of this disaster, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters are trying to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is unclear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The center of the criticism is British energy concern BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The Obama-appointed commission of inquiry is expected to present the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies filed applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent such a disaster with tighter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the Audit Office is fundamentally reforming, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption accusations.
Obama has also announced that he will eliminate lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now openly warning that tighter regulation will drastically reduce the volume of oil produced in the Gulf.
“Government plans are the biggest drag on gas and oil industry growth,” according to a recent industry survey by consulting firm BDO, ahead of Wednesday’s drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are shifting until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of oil leaked have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures journalists, "you'll still have enough oil silt in front of your lens today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian man watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading through the breast with water surrounded by smudges: the scene appears in a watery glow with rainbow colors almost all the way up nicely.
The fact that brown oil clots float beneath the surface is not to be seen.
She used to collect enough jarnels here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge wet area from a broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst-infested areas in the world.
On the way down the river through mangrove swamps with lots of side tributaries, the entire scope of the trigger is only noticeable.
The motor on the boat cooks brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand in the water, pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like the black sticks of licorice, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sad to hang.
We search in vain for the flocks of birds that are common in wet areas: As soon as the engine dies down on the boat, it settles in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a scary silence.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," says sadly Celestine Akpobari, "We live in constant fear for our health."
Comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni area has been a battleground for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe came here, in the 1980s, the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here Shell had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire triple-sized delta of Switzerland with more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of lead over two million barrels of black gold is being mined daily, the oil fields in the Ogoni area are too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred meters, steel construction rises from the water like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so they are too tenderly called heads of drill holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty to the core.
At any moment, such a head of the borehole breaks, says Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil spilled into the sea off Alaska in the Exxon Valdez supertanker crash 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell labels sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent pollution, environmentalists refer to cracked wellheads and leaky lines as the root cause.
In 2008, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner said that only the number of faults in the lines is “several times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-stained open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by management, partly arbitrarily scattered over the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
Oil is heated in the barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the line into the holding pot, then kerosene drips at the end of the line, and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 litres a day: "We earn about 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel can still be topped up by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from “bunkers” that connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost every day in the entire Niger Delta region.
But only a marginally small fraction of the provisionally stored raw material will be refined illegally: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officials, into tankers and sold on the world market.
Akpobari considers the debate whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax way of production to be purely academic.
"If oil companies were not considered intruders, and if they did not completely destroy the livelihoods of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the company’s departure can be considered: “Maybe other nations like the Chinese will turn out to be better.”
Michael is worried.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come at any time."
If they are found by a special military unit, they are not in danger of imprisonment, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
“This cursed thing has taken our country to the bottom in every respect,” Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction defect in the A380 engines
The A380 has a major safety issue.
Investigators found during a search of the aircraft that made an emergency landing, a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas plans to sue engine makers
Qantas Airbus passengers may have been more fortunate than previously known to make an emergency landing in early November: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety defect in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
Perhaps the defect would have severe consequences: cracks could form on one oil connection due to wear and tear, the ATSB said in a statement released on Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is Qantas, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of grounds in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing for further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce claims burning oil is the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a safety measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snow will cause chaos in traffic
Germany in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
Chaos reigns on many roads, connections by trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people died in road accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany: almost the whole republic was snowed in at night on Thursday in freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in service, but could not cope with the new snow.
In addition, there was a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a storm surge on the Baltic coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning, with water levels 1.2 metres above normal.
Snowstorms have caused significant problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
Therefore, according to the Meteomedia head office, there was a purple alert level in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, strong and fresh winds caused gusts.
Several trucks and passenger cars remained overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported great difficulties on the roads.
On the A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia, there were difficulties due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, inverted trees on the tracks or broken upper guides and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Thuringia Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drink from firefighters and paramedics on the train.
The snow blows across the road.
Many flights at major German airports were cancelled due to snow winds.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, flights cancelled from Munich have already been reported.
In Frankfurt, according to Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although few passengers remain at the airport without a connection, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train, so the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after rolling over on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
Meteorologists have good news, however: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of gale force.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could be worth up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank was just renovating its headquarters: twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district were being modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group apparently wants the renovation costs back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, according to the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still investigating whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then lease it again," he said.
In this way, the largest credit institute in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them.
According to data, the energy conversion cost about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the towers to be renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros, according to a newspaper text.
A spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would again be sold to the fund's assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people paid tribute to the buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It has not yet been possible to free the dead, as the security situation in the shaft continues to be complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety.
Second, the strong detonation was based on the fact that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
They still haven't been able to free the dead.
Now they honor the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
To honor the memory of the buried miners, 29 tables were built, on them helmets, lamps and names of miners.
Also pictures and personal items like clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand was hoping that the miners would once again come out of the "deep earth" to the surface, New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said to participants in the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he's seen his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Apart from the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also took part in the commemoration.
British and South African miners were also swamped during the November 19 explosion.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases are dissolved, they will begin cooling the high temperatures inside the mine, police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warriors!
Is horror good for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to resurrect the old frontier with his fighting epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents on a large scale with almost supernatural power - it sounds ideal for young male spectators who are looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and his enemies tear even the guts out of his belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eye, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters also utter at most one or two sentences or let themselves be drawn to the distressing dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and revel in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts interested in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It is good when the film has multiple target groups, it is only a pity when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists bringing his works either more humor to the mainstream or less brutality to the art audience.
Most fans of art cinema seem to be discouraged everywhere by the splashing brain and guts.
Fans of action films will get bored at the latest when One-Eyed goes to Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries for freely explained reasons, and will hang for eternity in the calm and fog before apparently the men arrive in America and remain silent there.
It is no wonder that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not make it to the cinemas and was now released only on DVD.
It is a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes with twisted blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or an exact plot, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
This is not an escape for the viewer.
Refn does not allow him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his chilling shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, especially the indescribable hatred that flows from the hearts of the characters.
Only the little blond boy who helps the One-Eyed retains something like innocence, everyone else being driven by malice.
Of all, the most one-eyed hero, whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and transient allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It portrays destruction, perhaps but also only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new warnings about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and will not even allow control.
At least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria around midnight on September 5-6, 2007.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that deviates from the current.
Based on a statement by the U.S.-based CIA foreign intelligence service in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented the video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where some of the reactor's components might have been before the destruction, to be a scaled-down copy of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear center model.
In addition, there were still pictures that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much is known more than then, even the riddles have grown even larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently stated in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about the "alleged reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "authentic".
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how confident he was that the reactor was in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The rubble of the supposedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly leveled the terrain.
Still, in June 2008, the IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar that had been produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial vendors from the immediate aftermath of the attack through a member state, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market, because they are exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
This was refuted by the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, he banned the inspectors from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
“We will never comment on this,” said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has been dragging on in vain since June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem given the credibility of the Authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - after all, this is a serious violation of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA sees as the key to progress on the matter three other devices that are to be "in functional contact" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which devices are involved or what function they have or why they are suspicious.
The IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite images, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It appears to be inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base, which is precisely why Syria refuses to allow the IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to locate military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite imagery that material has been transported back and forth between these three sites and the square near Euphrates.
In Vienna, a high-ranking Western diplomat said at least one device should be "in connection with fuel production".
But there is “no evidence of sensitive activities,” that is, enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from, and where plutonium should later be split off into bombs, there are only plausible estimates for these central issues.
It is also unknown whether debris that could hide important clues is stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to know where the rubble has gone.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, and on the other side of Euphrates, the salt mine al-Tibni, which Syria had checked in 1998 as a suitable storage for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But space images show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out ground work on all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months developing a plan for reviewers that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only this effort shows how much interest the reviewers have.
Meanwhile, Damascus rejected the proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the thing did not burn, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Viennese nuclear authority has to enforce inspections.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspections, has already spoken of the "possibility to which I am leaning in the future", but so far he is hesitant.
On the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented are not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on her still nameless directorial debut this summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but it also causes restlessness.
There is persistent talk that the woman, who is a Muslim, will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned shooting from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
In the meantime, the film has been completed in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic of the UN Women's War Victims Organization wrote through UNHCR to Jolie demanding a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported - Jolie is also the UN's ambassador for refugee relief.
She is not very diplomatic - she offered to meet women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In rape camps, love stories didn’t happen, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended to the UN refugee agency that Jolie be released as an ambassador.
What scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given her script to read, allowed filming after minor brawls in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author emphasizes that in her film she does not pursue any political intentions, that she devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film that sounds really different on the Internet: the lovers knew each other before the war began and they meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
This is quite different from "a rape victim falls in love with his torturer".
The fact that the movie Jolie really begins before the war - is true.
Jolie says she is under pressure “that is not fair and is based on wrong information.”
Now she can be freed by Hollywood hackers: by illegally posting her script online, as they have done so many times before.
Nothing but Gone
It's good for the Irish again tonight.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy at the sound of loud music, stomping their feet.
Bailey-Pub in Cork, South Ireland, boils because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and they hit each other.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and a restrained computer scientist, it doesn't go well with each other.
Still, the 26-year-old tries to have fun, to take a break from the burdensome question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a gambling passion in Las Vegas, he is going to an interview in New Zealand in January.
“I have a weird feeling about this,” he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign", says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT-advisor in London.
Boys leave: Like the Tanners, it looks like it in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will be leaving the country in the near future, say experts from the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin.
By 2015, there will be 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a wave of emigration similar to what Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing that has brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is mainly affecting young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced an upswing so far.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years of boom.
Everyone was needed, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
There are many letters in the Irish Times from readers complaining, "In Ireland, everything goes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"Please let the last one go out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is only deceiving and offers no prospects for the future to young people.
“They’re cutting the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” she says.
She observes her classmates fluttering from one unpaid practitioner to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to look at the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers total service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners in the labor market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
His website features photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Seán O'Donovan has known for six months what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues at a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off a home loan.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says when he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in."
She laughs awkwardly and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, in the entrances are parked large expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Are you worried that the loan might not work out well?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer doesn't like the whining he hears so often these days.
“No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island,” he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll feel like Irish people."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait to see how life unfolds elsewhere.
He has also worked in London for several years and why shouldn’t it be so good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him these days: celebrating his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might go wrong at the bachelor party.
"Emotions, especially," he says, and drinks a good beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds disturbing.”
“Let’s call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime is more important than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can track changes in attitudes across the entire area.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related issues.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several Pacific Rim countries has increased significantly in South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering after a deep decline in output last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are convinced Democrats, which pulls down the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in their country in practice, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a large increase (Figure 3).
Roughly 34% said they trust the Assembly in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support came about during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped to protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and fell again to 32 percent that year.)
However, the mood changes in a wide range from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime worsened.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important issue rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives fell victim to crime last year, but this is down from 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private business is essential for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized Elections
No one expected the November 28 general election in Haiti to be perfect.
But they were far worse than the outsiders who were trying to help the afflicted country to be afraid.
The election meant filling ballot boxes and recurring ballots, ballots scattered across channels, broken polling stations, and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced due to the January earthquake, roamed around trying to figure out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed forerunners, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent in nature, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, stated that "it was a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The final battle is scheduled for January.
Not all electoral hopes are lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their original call for the vote to be declared void.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among the voters, is marked by the electoral commission for having achieved a decisive duel.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
About 250,000 of the IDs required for voting remained undistributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
On tiptoe to the center
In the weeks following her sudden widowhood, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, benefits from the public's sympathy, when her popularity has increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's election may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández will give up the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
All these signs will be based on it.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of compiling budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at the death of Mr Kirchner from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also be in place for next year, with the president having more room to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and unionists speak of a figure approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared INDEC, the statistical agency that has agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández moderate this policy now?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy has been boosted by the rise in world prices for Argentine agricultural exports.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is making it clear that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government formed an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina failed to pay in 2001.
Now, President Fernández is facing a deal with the creditor governments, which are grouped together in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to draft a new national consumer-price index that would resemble an introduction to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term, when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, which is tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the tide of sympathy will be waning.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to quietly renounce many of the views her husband held in politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Taiwan's voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, elected mayors and city councils in five city districts on November 27, which can be seen as a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself represents the feelings that prevail towards the mainland and have a strong place in business relations, including the partially free trade agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only close.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the mayor's five offices, it failed to win by a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes against the 45% KMT party.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of votes has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party, together with KMT, was in city councils.
The election was held like most of Taiwan's elections, which included noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags of sparsely clad girls.
There was even a mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien clean across his face, wounding him and killing the viewer.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting influenced the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates struggled over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT thus tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also refrained from inciting anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma confirmed on his side that China's policy is acceptable for most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue to pursue commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but first things first.
It will be better to wait for the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP party has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and a supporter of clear independence.
But under Ms Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as the DPP's candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held the office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be upset by this shift.
In a statement released from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will struggle to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the hasty pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go into the campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reorganize his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly advocated proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Award Nomination: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding Surprises Best New Artist
Speeches at the request of the President and the people must necessarily be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is cited as one of the surprise Grammy Awards this year with a nomination for Best New Artist.
As Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008 when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly seen a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success, recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for a Grammy voter looking for a similar jazz piece in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy jurors rightly appreciate Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by albums by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge of steampunk has won several well-deserved accolades in the category of large ensembles, competing with chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" has created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Music
Classical music nominations at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a score of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a score of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also stand a chance of being awarded.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The Classical Music Producer of the Year category has five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album went to Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; the Artifacts by Various
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyric Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the BBC's Orchestra and the National Theatre.
Composers who are nominated for Grammys for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti," and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance that was recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performances by the soloist with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written a 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year’s nominees included only women: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classics transition category, she was nominated by soprano Jessye Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives the approval of the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project, saying it promotes terrorism and will lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the jurors decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in accordance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whoever you think of," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"As an American citizen, I am very proud of that."
“Justice always wins.”
“The opposition is minimal,” he added.
"Those who are against it only shout loudly."
"We have some really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time was spent discussing with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no America anymore,” one comment read.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty sunk in the sand".
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York City.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families had languished in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wished for a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented together with the filter system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque will also have two minarets and grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council on the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and essential until now.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it doesn’t prove that this is some form of truly ‘alien’ life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after phosphorus is replaced with arsenic.
"You'll be amazed at what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth, as researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report of this novelty published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That's not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to harness other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that a microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one for the other.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms can be very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that just like phosphorus does not work. When it gets into the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when exposed to phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility increases that a life form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced with phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it may have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four show dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akitas and a large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs later Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, as well as not sharing detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not contacted to comment on the case.
They were very happy when on Wednesday afternoon their two Akitas were found in a shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace and a 10-month-old bitch Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi breeds Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to participate in district competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners this week, remained undiscovered until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions, scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on the couple's nearly month-long dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a boxer's puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany Pointer - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akity and Pembroke left Welsh corgis in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs would have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday morning.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs. Dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether the prizes would be awarded.
Lion is once again ready to roar now that the restructuring of MGM is getting final approval from the court
After 18 months of upheaval and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start over.
A federal insolvency judge on Thursday officially blessed a “pre-packaged” plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code leaves MGM no legal hurdles to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the lead executives of the lean studio.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on planned financial resources to allow a $500 million loan to fund new MGM operations and production.
Now it is a connection to the investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million per year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial troubles and the studio's 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay the $2 billion plus the funding demanded by the lenders.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a success fee of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film that year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the funding of two films, based on the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, sought to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget in Balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99, and one Kinect game costs just as much as 10 bead jump ropes or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law was working; this year’s tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys with associated sites have appeared, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
There is an increase in the number of toys with button batteries, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years) are cuddly animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
At one press, the animal emits a tone, and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can’t stop.
The best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year at Elmo Live technology, I rented a 14-inch animatric doll that can play Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel lock.
The children test a Mickey dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn driving into fun with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you’re looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest easy-to-use variant, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective a teaching as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, for children ages 3 to 7) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, the Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are no larger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing dice in a row before time runs out; it’s great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two toys were represented in the toy stores Webkinz and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include roller skates or an animal puffle.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years of age), the latest in a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random directions.
It’s fun when you make a maze out of cubes and see if he manages to find his way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of finer police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders in a semi-voiced manner with military authority.
He wanted female members - China's stalwart enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their harsh interventions and predilection for violence - to convey a certain impression on the crowd of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispers softly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are lined up like a ruler.
Four headgear sit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang disdainfully.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has sought to revive the image of urban overseers in China.
One city ordered the new recruits to have a college education.
Guangdong Province has changed its grey-green uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China replaced stares with heavy armor: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers had crouched around the snack cart and stared intently at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, an urban district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its municipal police force with 13 women who were selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry, and young age.
The aim is to show not only the rough side of the police but also the gentler, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in Hubei province beat an uninvolved spectator to death after he used his cell phone to film what they were doing in a protest against the landfill.
Last year, police officers were trained in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year, a door-to-door melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left brain injury.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, depicts Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after another discussion over tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editorial by The Beijing Evening News addressed the issue of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female contenders between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good physique and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - i.e. higher than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, as if by a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "inner qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city management, disagrees with this description very much.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in other jobs in China, for both genders.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of debate among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or a humpback man to serve here," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolling Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with apple-like faces and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely driving traders into alleyways where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, the group faces more than ten marketers running around on foot or on bicycles, trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu, as the market-keeper began to run away, and for a time he left his bicycle with a cart of noodles.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
“Every day is basically the same thing,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her free marketing.
"The Great Routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers of their male counterparts to confiscate goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumors spread that police had killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where police officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Police seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes distance from the police, looking angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintaining and smoothing the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
“It’s usually the public that starts it.”
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who was, until the time of the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there is no plan to bring any further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department, who argued that there was substantial evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents that were published in the October 2009 New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so much are the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had been Mr. Ensign's assistant until recently, he was barred from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year by law.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in violation of the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was released "it became clear that this was a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington, D.C. lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits after a large number of setbacks, including last year's decision to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of prosecutorial misconduct.
Federal prosecutors have "clearly concealed weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in the case.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief lawyer, told him in an interview that he had been called by the Attorney General of the Department of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the Department had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team is working with prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had forwarded to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt an investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethics group filed allegations that payment of Ensign's parents to the Hamptons of $96,000 violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant anything other than a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that had long supported the Senator.
A December 2008 e-mail showed that after Mr. Hampton began to work in the company as a lobbyist, the head of Mr. Ensign's staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton, telling him that he was "pounding" to the Home Office on the subject being discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevadan client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of the criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people," she continued.
Cheshire's appeal turns to Twitter
Half a dozen were written in the courtroom.
One minute later, they were sending news of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 messages on Twitter dealt with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
Thursday saw the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, a family, and was to be held an official termination with the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by mainstream reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of the information with outrageous details then introduced the jury into the decision in terms of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether to require new rules in the courtroom with the advent of new technologies.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes's lead defense attorney.
The trial's judge, Jon C. Blue of the state's High Court, has succinctly dismissed claims regarding last week's ruling, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury acted under public influence.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his ruling that the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell was a "carnival atmosphere" at the media trial.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts, which reviewed Hayes' sentence half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was exercised arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms may make the trial fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes' lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
For example, defense attorneys say Mr. Hayes may have been biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them crime-ridden photos when choosing a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, which became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, saying the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision incorrectly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about it over the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the most interest.
They stated in an objection to the verdict made last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was debated during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media constantly fanned the flames of emotion over the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "was something that has never been seen here in New Haven before, and it may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports given later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should direct the field of action of the other trials.
But some lawyers have demanded appellate courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require the courts to adapt.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision on Dr. Sheppard's sentence, due to the breadth of the proceedings, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility overcome the chasm?
After a campaign that was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of politeness emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and parliamentary leaders has yielded no major breakthroughs on the crucial issues that need to be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party strife.
Wednesday's public session of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built up a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
The two sides are now in a probationary period - probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's hearing and its subsequent evaluation by the participants were conducted with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The election aroused the emotions of the party members, and then they were quiet.
It's good."
On several issues, particularly those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits just because Republicans can’t watch them support tax cuts for the wealthy while refusing unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new inaugural treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes for January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
"Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that politeness would lead them to actually cooperate.
"I look at all the events between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the build-up of the new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of the tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, they know they must act on their promises, and they must cut government spending and repeal the new health care bill.
These partisan lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and they have, in their opinion, put pressure on the deficit issue to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials on the jury, who suggest that, in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, little groundwork or the will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to address the budget, taxes, and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is plenty of evidence that, despite the partisanship at the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could go to a stalemate, as it did in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public’s reactions very closely.
Whoever is threatened with a reduction in votes is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
Partyism and regulation are larger today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there has been a greater ideological divide between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than there has been with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US documentary portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and it continues with part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia reported in the records from February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of the office" - takes its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The entry, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on their website via WikiLeaks on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have for many years consistently denied allegations of corruption, and won several lawsuits for perjury charges for such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when asked about the proven testimony on corruption: "It's crazy, it's filth, it's crap."
Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details said in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“The government of the city of Moscow and its connection to the criminal elements have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ confirming that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than like a government,” the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krisha' (a term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts identified and three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world".
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Home Office and Militia are in second degree".
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It's an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas, as the city doesn't provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so on course."
The record says that while withdrawals are complex, protection itself may already be in trouble; even those paying may sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their stores close under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably crammed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem research team, said in a recent interview.
“It’s part of the bureaucracy.”
"He is not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by NGO Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
Unveiling the U.S. Embassy report, which appeared in Moscow late in the evening, certainly did not excite the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue about the solution to the problem.
Speaking to CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents released by WikiLeaks may have been forgeries and reacted angrily to the statement that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev's Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it is our mutual cooperation that is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to come to terms with past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves that moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge possession in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge relinquished power, long-standing loyalty is also being eroded in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims of the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court jointly bring the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, the sentence of the former leader, the notorious Tuol Sleng violent association, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest grew among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to re-enter Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to its first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically reminisce about the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people have benefited minimally from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of making a trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok has fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to make everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute senior officials and people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the anxieties in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation centered on Im Chaema, 64, who was a district leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from field work to her wooden cottage on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had called her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court searches for more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms means the bonding of broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand each other."
The center has published the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, it has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be prosecuted."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complicated and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong spell here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains is a road overgrown with weeds and littered with discarded plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile saleswoman on the side of the road, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated at the site.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to later visit the resting place of Pol Pot, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees that it appears its stockpile of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its highly enriched uranium reserves, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after a security summit between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and they seemed to have hit the rock of injury last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, several covert operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, as this is a sensitive matter.
The deal proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear safety advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all their highly enriched uranium reserves.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity ... We're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply a Belarusian research institute with less-enriched uranium that is unsuitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust basis," which led to a deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to a joint statement, seek to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that a more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make CIA flights expensive
The Spanish government was not making a fuss about CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as the United States envoy to Madrid said in his telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to El País, which also says that then-Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed so that it "could show that it has proper oversight of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communiqué in which dozens of states, including Spain, were accused of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's announcement "removed Zapatero's government from the game" and insisted Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with flights of intelligence services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
Also, then-Secretary of State Miguel Ángel Moratinos hinted to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter as little outline as possible, however, because the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited options for influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he had no intention of blocking a judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated component or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern over the "apparent coordination between a Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than the declassification of CNI or Department of Defense information.
“This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly among governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of a luncheon with U.S. Ambassador and Home Secretary Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had already instructed his co-workers to "avoid heated comments with the intention of reducing tensions".
The ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the Partido Popular (PP) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations could have negative consequences for the U.S. government," he notes.
Mother-of-murder admits to complaining about mother's "worry"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was dead, and she had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she used from an early age, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the region of La Coruna, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimonies of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, it is clear from the content of her communication that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca, writing, "Alberto is angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with the baby all day and he can't do what he wants."
She then talks about the text message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send your baby to."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he says of his return to his home, "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only staying until 19 because I have to go to work on the 20th so I don't lose that job."
He explains that if everything goes well, he will take his son with him.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, me, and I'll never leave him with anyone but my mother again in my life," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There is another contribution in July.
When he taps this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'm going to save some money for the nanny."
On the 17th, greetings and grievances.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how he likes it, he'll meet me, sex is needed".
On the thirtieth, another message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan".
There is also one message about Víctor, the current partner: "He gives me money".
On the Internet, there are Móniča’s posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she let herself be called "Muki the ex-prisoner".
"Terror in Galician (motto)".
The last man she lived with, a guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe that everything happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention centre in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, stated that the defendant does not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one in any way".
She admitted that she had drowned César in the bathtub and had put his body in the trunk.
The defense attorney and prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would win four seats in the House and the PSC would lose nine seats.
With the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the lead in the town halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes obtained and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has a given idea of general elections, whether they increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually once that compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this tendency to increase, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the voters of the PP, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could gain 12 MPs in the House compared to the current 8, the party of the Civic Union (Convergence and Union) would lose at least 10 of them.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - now it has 3 - while the ICV would continue to have one mandate, or another.
However, according to the election calendar, the next election will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of socialist domination in the four main provincial cities, as well as changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree that the PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive a majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona assembly - as it needs to win at least 5% of the vote.
The PP party increased the number of votes received in the four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 more votes than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The people also gained at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP has representation in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalonia gives thousands of passports to Al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian who were detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of the Al-Qaeda organization, among which were also "Tigers of Liberation of Tamil Eelam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", the latter of which was named in 2008 by the group.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure through "Operation Kampai" the weakening of the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then delivered to the groups that make up the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their “fighters” could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active one that the jihad network had in Europe, and therefore, in addition to Thai services, other European police units participated in these investigations, and it cannot be ruled out that in the coming days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) another one developed in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Atthan and Thares were captured.
It was these men who drove a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, stole passports from tourists that met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, they had to be valid for several years and be without a marked visa.
It is emphasized in the investigation documents that there are no known facts linking the detainees from Catalonia to the Bombay bombing, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which were "put" to buy cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
Police have confiscated a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) calls on Masa to stop fiscal deal
The leader of the PPC party, Alicia Sanchez-Camach, had the opportunity yesterday to present to Arturo Masa personally the conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky enterprises such as the economic deal that the leader of the nationalists wants to draft during his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People’s Party came to a meeting with Arturo Maso with the certainty of 18 seats received in last Sunday’s election, a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the candidate of the CiU needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment to office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists would like to maintain in the House when the general elections are held, but for now, the talks that Mas is having with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the president of the PP, in order to win her support for taking office, "he will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches", as well as to the economic agreement - similar to the one in the Basque Country - about which the leader of the CiU even wanted to have a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the bloated political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
Details of the negotiations regarding Mass's inauguration will be discussed within the PP party of Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) today.
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur due to a "lack of action"
The Olot Center’s performances do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot geriatric centre (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors he had in his care.
The director of the elderly home, Joan Sala, accompanied by the facility's lawyer, Joan Canada, announced that "the wishes of the La Caritat home could be to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the reputational damage that this institution may suffer due to the failure to detect the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the material compensation requirements already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors now pose a major threat to the La Caritat home.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the elderly residents of the home on suspicion that in many cases no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled by phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected this extremeness yesterday through its director, stressing that "the lack of action could in no way have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party has committed misconduct other than the defendant's own."
The man, now nicknamed "The Angel of Death," confessed to 11 deaths yesterday, stating that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed the second old woman a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by giving too high a dose of insulin, unlike in the first case when he used a mixture of calming tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff's access to medicines.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably six times out of nine the caregiver used to kill patients in an attempt to relieve their suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila was really looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by serving lye, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe the medical claims and do not rule out that the number of killed may be higher than he has admitted, and they justify their behavior in the various versions filed by Vila to the court knowing that he must change his behavior when it came out that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say they want justice to be available to shed light on the full scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank threatens
Investors reacted sharply to the threat posed by the president of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to respond.”
Marginal differentials closed by force and European banks’ shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's capacity to err - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose his worries.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back liquidity today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy back the state debt for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline, leaving unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be forecast "at least until March" and to comply with the three-month open-access auction by the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and even announce its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations created, they will recreate the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly withdraw the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at a convention in May where they claimed they hadn’t even considered buying bonds, and markets collapsed - history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armored fist announced it on Monday, and on Wednesday, it said it had already bought many, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's promissory notes for one year in Portugal were very poor.
El Tesoro spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, rates in Portugal fell by 30 points, reflecting the change in market sentiment that followed Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts are about 10,000 million in short-term securities and another 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after not revealing the problem in July stress tests, the amounts are acceptable under the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get the new budget approved by parliament, and it still does not have enough support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in the face for the next EU summit on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action, which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment - in the ears of investors it sounds like the Four Seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as other European exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in high demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash at El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would close to us sine die.
However, the strategy of Cesare's wife must continue - "not only to be so, but also to seem so".
We can do this.
Eulen Group President challenges Vega Sicilia’s actions requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not subside.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, will challenge El Enebro's legal action planned for 16th of this month and demanded five of its seven descendants to try to force their majority and seize power with the help of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's public prosecutors.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José fine-tune the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of society.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem willing to let up in his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro group.
Five of its seven descendants, who were named leaders during the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 of this year, were deposed from its administrative committee and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register.
The trial of El Enebro, scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by the official of the Commercial Court number 2 in Madrid, has restored the thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family once again.
An appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is considered by David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of court deceit and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the January 18 negotiations, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying a legal challenge to this conduct as "completely irrelevant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the court to convene a hearing in June.
In El Enebro, a group that owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, it controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group demands a right of use for 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when hearing the question of judicial challenge to the hearing.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterised by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newly arrived team too seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to diminish the driving ability of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that powers his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - the "secret weapon" that the multi-ethnic Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for purposes very far removed from automobile sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision instruments.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to carry out “in a matter of hours, in near real time” modifications and improvements that would otherwise be detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, except for the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser manufacturing systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical achievement is $40 million, which is the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant 50km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "big secret".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the immense technological means that the energy drinks brand has put into its participation in the race circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey said five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% to the victory, and the rest was thanks to the riders.
Currently, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth 85% of the achievements, while the pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores in two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 80-100 m2 stores that the multinational plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrer, vice president of HP Spain, said the newly remodeled store at Barcelona’s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where the other stores would open, however, she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrer, who also leads HP’s HR systems, said the business-opening philosophy would remain the same, using local distributors with industry experience and expertise.
The North American company advises here on the exclusive design of shop equipment (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in staffing for stores.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging".
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pioneering pilot program that aims to address any problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"That way we can solve problems within 10 minutes that might otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contract service of technical assistance," Helena Herrerová stressed yesterday.
Sabadell Says It Will Steal 1 Million Customers From Its Competitors In 3 Years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s board member Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but he rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
Nevertheless, it counts on lowering interest rates, which they will try to compensate by discounting bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to gain a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 for three years.
The goal is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - respectively 700,000, if those who eventually leave the bank - because until now, even the institute has been more fond of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or one can also say sobriety, in order to reduce costs, the calls of which the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
Few banking institutions dare to set targets and publish them at this time, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an expansion for another period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At an APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the road out of the crisis in Spain "will be a long one".
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create employment" in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that passive war - which reduces margins - is receding, the premiums for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their issuances to receive liquidity are already shifting to credit prices, compensating for the margin cut.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will constitute a pressure factor on loans".
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise prices for differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is to reduce commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be demanded".
“There will be no stone left next year,” he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "largely reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter among the red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can substitute fundraising in the market before a new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell may survive temporary market closures, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis continues to be a serious problem.
He notes that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what was in June, short-term financing can be received using repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of mergers of savings banks
The CEO of CECA rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of mergers of savings banks, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of pooling Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not take part in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, José Antonio Olavarrieta, CEO of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), ruled out a new wave of these operations yesterday.
"I believe that most mergers have already been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening is conventions".
"Most of it is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the big processes are already done and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well on this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA, Olavarrieta said that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the instalments that have appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank at the time, not now".
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we must be on time before the end of the year".
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director noted that given the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks as well as the system that has managed the "very important" process of concentration and that continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from reducing taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Control - note), the administrator of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which alludes to the idea of upholding the old traditions held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of these is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the brand - although now it may seem like scifi, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to recast the euro with more macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigour, fines for guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and an extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for tricks now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission incited deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform off its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany thought was right (the plans for fiscal austerity and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully dragged forward the decision to save Greece.
Even then it was the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel once again appeared with a clear position when she demanded to reform the European Union's conventions in order to allow the rescue of a member state, while at the same time making private creditors liable to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat relaxed form, has been approved, and over the coming months we should follow the Union's reform process, which should allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
And he tells all of us that although there is now a need to take measures with which he seems to disagree too much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mark the birth of a new currency zone, in which rule-breaking states will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce deferred payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we need to take a tough path of growth with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
They simply do not want to tolerate another option based on debt and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed during the boom in Spain’s growth.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And worst of all, under these circumstances, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will give way to more calm.
And we will take advantage of the opportunity that they are giving us until spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this as well, and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting with big businesses last Saturday and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticisms of Merkel, the road has opened up to the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And of the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
Fints like Alonso and Ramos showed in the match against Ajax show wit, not intent on escaping punishment.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be put out about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behavior and whether UEFA should eventually punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly won), the named players one by one deliberately lost time at the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the referee, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in their group lead - and will be able, deprived of cards, to proceed to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee awarded coach José Mourinho a two-match penalty and the guilty players were fined cash.
Provocation of the yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are unwritten, but are being followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that it was attended by the Real Madrid team (which boasts generosity and honor in its anthem, and which has already fined its players for similar actions), and it seems also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether there is circumvention of the law in these acts; these are indeed actions respecting the rules of sport, the meaning of which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
What kind of harm is caused by such actions?
One of the elements of sportsmanship is the physical inviolability of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, i.e. there was no violent play.
Another of these prerequisites for a clean game is to avoid allowing players to have an advantage over the opponent's team due to their offense - which did not happen here either.
Thus, the paradoxical thing about Real Madrid players’ actions is that what we normally characterize as a ruse or circumvention of the law did not occur, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should have been as visible as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
Another question, however, is what advantage the culprits will have from their intentional misdemeanor.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that there will be no gain in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by this action the players will get rid of the penalty, and pass to the second round of cards, in which one card less than in the first round is enough to be eliminated.
So as the rounds continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and circumvention of the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was definitely ingenuity.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions to provoke them from the leadership were carried out.
Damage to sporting principles by such actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
The fight of offers on the organization of Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictation of the calendar concentrates this year's avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Just like the Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December again come the pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, they have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complexity of the numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) applications for the week starting December 13, creating an avalanche of reservations for peak days (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon the traditions, many employees pay for spending at parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices at the limit of carrying capacity, according to the president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurant establishments at the moment does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think twice before making a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they're cautious about pricing," he adds.
The stores will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a reasonable price", he says, recalling that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go a step down and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest onslaught of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
Soteras Group is reporting a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with most requests for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adjusted by the offered currencies, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company, which is Andilana, comprising 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar more early reservations and this since the beginning of November.
“We have made it possible and impossible for us to keep the prices from last year, and our menus, which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after recording an increase in profits from the second half of the year and have a fairly solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources emphasize that December 18th will also be a busy day as pre-Christmas celebrations between friends will take place.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava.
They also noted that there are already companies that are inviting their employees again, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centers in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, claiming that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients "contract to the maximum".
This impression did not subside even during the Christmas celebrations, whoever pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has created a lot of unrest in the United States.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that is stirring up Pakistan’s nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of North American diplomacy's communications and ideas in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "is in decline", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but stored in pieces to prevent their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is what Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson calculates in one report before visiting then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transportation of atomic materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer only observed by the US, but also by Russia, as spreading and representing a reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect its nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs," said Yury Korolev, an expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The biggest novelty of the documentation published by Julian Assange’s server is the increasingly low cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communications with Pakistan as "frustrating", claims "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected".
Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, said: “Despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "make it very clear" during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani military must put an end to tacit support for terrorist groups."
The Hunt for Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism official to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red call" to track and determine where Assange could be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol has issued an “extraordinary call,” a red notice, to “locate and track” Assange’s movements.
This is not a classic arrest warrant.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, WikiLeaks’ legal representative, said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
It was November 20 when the Lyon-based International Police Corps issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose a temporary detention and extradite him".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person subject to a red notice, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notice to allow the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially if the states have a bilateral agreement on the extradition of detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be.
The move has scandalized Assenge's lawyers, who published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks showed a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin’s security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal persecution," the letter states.
While the whole world is searching for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor of Time magazine - in this interview he demanded the resignation of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations in violation of the international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views voiced by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "so that it can intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went even further, saying that Assange should "be killed", which he subsequently had to call off.
"Obama should put a bounty on him or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that".
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former Arkansas governor, and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for the leak has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," he told Fox News.
Puigcercós looks for peace in ERC by "winking" at followers of Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote to remain.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting the many internal revolts in the ranks of the ERC, which were unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party leader is aware that his gesture of resignation seems inadequate to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot make him worry as much as he did with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to win over new critics with a wink that will help him to arm himself in the municipal elections.
At first, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to secretly comment on his continued tenure.
With ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the supporters of Caroda want to give the president a punitive vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid dissension and subjugation of his person.
in several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentage, that he would also not have a good result "in Bulgarian".
Supporters of Caroda demand more from the president than to put his office at his disposal - which they consider a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest body at conventions.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce the resignations, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
Because of this, they expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, which will be voted on by the management to the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to move the congress in the autumn of 2011.
The ERC leader stated that "multiplicity" is damaging stability, and that his goal is for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, there seems to be a symptomatic article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercós's ideologue, this innovation advisor took for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means to include also new faces who are from the sector favored by Carod.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should put an end to meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes, so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by vote.
Ending the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has fought in this direction already at the last two congresses.
However, a convulsive 2008 assembly decided that the board meeting must be considered at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
The matter is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of the matter.
Now, without critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to re-examine the issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the daily MILENIO.
Among the murders stand out the cases of three women and the finding of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, Mexico has a total of 390 homicides, possibly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, followed by a mercy wound to the head, and had hands and feet tied with rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the vehicle's luggage compartment above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in Naucalpan County.
Early on the morning of Thursday, November 4, co-workers discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in a section of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a message signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered in Nezahualcoyotl by eight gunshots after he left his house to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims aged 30 were killed by a bullet in the head in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, the corpse of a man shot in the forehead was found, and under the body was found a shell casing from a .25 caliber gun.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body have been found in a sewer in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue teams searched for other parts of it, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlan reported finding the body with their hands tied back and head wrapped in place of Pena Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in the Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district was announced, the victims also found reports of death threats.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the Los Reyes district of La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the seventeenth, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca County, and the next morning a killed man was found in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was provisionally identified as Mario Ríos according to a report left by the killers on his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a lifeless woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement with two wounds to the nape.
A tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death") was discovered on the woman's skin, as well as necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, the corpse of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in a car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads wrapped in tape were found, and a report was also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec bearing signs of torture and had limbs tied up, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the counties of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and had a message left with him; while the second was martyred and was found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with a message.
China keeps its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
The country’s representative to the UN climate change conference at COP16 assured that its country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, stating that he insisted on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative to the UN climate change conference, said.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But he said China will not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on the matter.
China’s strategy on climate change is divided into four categories: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
They have already made progress on all these points, including last year’s approval of a new energy bill that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In China, federal authorities have worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
Further, he said, various multi-year plans are in progress or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and other governments.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place for the last five years, has received investment from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also underway, as well as the project of replacing fluorescent lamps with energy-saving bulbs and the project of mitigation and adaptation, he specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than is generally thought.
For example, per capita greenhouse gas emissions account for 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Espina's Exclusion Act: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to demand his right from the National Order Commission.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been legislated, and that the former chairman of that party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and claim his right.
in an interview that was taken before the objection was raised by the governor of the state, Gabin Cué Monteagudo, said that the expulsion of Espino is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the National Council's Order Commission in his case, so that it is a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now was not the time to think about 2012 and that she had never been at the negotiating table about the alliance's candidacy for the presidency.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN would emerge from the internal elections held the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor would be elected, strengthened.
"This is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was an intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The president of the Polish Academy of Sciences said that 71 years of dialogue are behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said that the committee would be able to choose without debate the best chair or chair that the PAN deserves for the next three years, so it would hand over the baton to "whom the committee will designate".
"So I'm absolutely calm and relaxed, and I'm proud to hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five."
He predicted that the rise the party recorded in the last election in July would be reflected in future rallies, though "there is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and be the subject of observation across the country, as "there are many expectations and aspirations embedded in them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to those expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) because of his speeches during the four years he reigns, César Nava called on PRI members to think about the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Gorin.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderón, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell,” he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during a speech in the National Auditorium, as no gag or censorship is used in this country.
Obama passes law to support undocumented students on Twitter
“If you think the passing of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama has joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which is supposed to legalize students without documents.
“If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to an online link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact senators immediately as the vote on the bill approaches.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such a blockade, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to compile a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there is still time..."
"We all agree that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe we will be able to reach an agreement on this at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to close the debate" on the Dream Act, so a motion to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though more likely next week.
Senatorial approval of the Dream Act would legalize roughly 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have resided in the country for the past five years, and have been admitted to an institution of higher learning or to the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters are conducting intense agitation to ensure that the bill is passed.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, expressed his support for the bill, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters most negotiate are Maine Senator Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who has supplemented the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John McCain, has yet to comment.
Although the House of Representatives favors a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is analogous to the Czech "hit the nail on the head - note.
The second round of the Pleasure from Language cycle was a promenade where participants performed a literary gala performance
"I understand Sex in the language, but... Finger to the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of The Pleasure of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair, they explained the topic of Sex at the Round Table).
The finger "takes us to the edge", said the lovely Argentinean writer to an audience, composed mostly of young people, gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this roundtable debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Schultz then described as a great story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist who, in search of knowledge, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although the traces of the same story do.
She said: “Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my wound.”
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the journey, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents the truly open and the symbolic one is the scar".
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she only managed to learn about the wound, that it is really open and that it does not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuela played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also performed a delightful narration, which he called The Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but at one point it appears.
with elements of magical realism tells of a famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far away, or corrected the virtues lost by one virgin, this narration which was then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers, who narrated it, were not missing, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo as retelling.
“Cervantes, who invented us all, ridiculed the fake testimony presented as real in the stories, but in another way he never managed to tell the story of America with such imagination that even shame was lacking.”
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and it is where reality and falsehood merge, where one no longer knows what belongs to one group and what belongs to another, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is what he calls the “Cervant tradition.”
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter highlighted and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair with her talk Finger to the Wound made possible.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer has pointed her finger at the great scourge of social violence that runs through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude with a quiet compromise that is obviously not intended," she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is being formed between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and in the control of consciousness that abounds in dogmatism, it is forgotten that "behind every no is a small no and behind every denial is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and to color is to put a finger in the wound many times and to annoy those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloration, and to annoy also the authorities who prefer this black and white world," he said, to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has already achieved on three occasions on the decisive series.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different styles will clash, characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has left with a missed goal, which is why this chance is special for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and played with the same team curiously the following final.
The Santist strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura tournament, holding the reins of the club Morelia, with whom he lost 4-2 against Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" of Toluca, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenáci" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note.) after 210 minutes of the game indecisively 2-2, but after a series of penalty shots he got to the advantage of three of one
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, therefore he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that the institution is the most important for him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me too, but the first one is the most important," he said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
In the living memory he has the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned, until the match is over, we can't celebrate".
He is not worried that this series could decide in penalty shots, he believes his players: "You never try to come to a series of penalty kicks, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were ready, but unfortunately, fate prepared a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when we felt it in our hands.
Romano has in his hands a chance to stop being the other and taste the glory that titles bring for the first time.
U.S. Changes Visa Rules
People will have to contact the Visa Application Service Centers before the Consular Department interview; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa process at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Application Services Centres (abbreviated from ASC English) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The personnel from the ASC will remove the biometric information of the applicant and it will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of handling the visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay a fee for arranging a meeting, a second for processing the application and another for delivery of the document by the shipping service.
The applicant will pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary worker visas), and $390 for a visa for merchants and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to have an interview with a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Since the biometric information will be removed at the ASC, applicants who will require a second appointment with an interview at the Consular Department will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, spread, and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalists, NASA assured that they would present a "discovery that will cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life", which prompted speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were thought to be uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and this ability increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like Earth's.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true impact of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan ( Saturn's largest moon) with the perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergentia and Patron spawn opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period was not even started when the opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech for "Partido del Trabajo", PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech for "Labour Party", Czech for "Part.
Prior to the beginning of the sitting for the opening of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD, and Patrón Montalvo "bubbled" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it eliminates them.
With this reform, they repeated, "bapartism" begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brito of the PAN (Partido Acción) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constituted political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech for "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and the PAN.
He specified that in the coming days they would talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be subjected to the two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When they got here (the opposition coalition) that's what I'm looking at, because we're out of any decision, they don't even have the willingness to consider the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergence party said they were in agreement with the PRD, PT and Patron and would therefore form a pluralist group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, for Congress, having been monopolistic, to be now "duopolitan."
The aspiration of law reform is not to have endless bipartism in Congress.
The group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT party explained that currently Congress has become the "prey" of the two - in allusion to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It used to be controlled by one side, now it's divided by two."
Patron Montalvo asked that the MP's personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"For the five of us, who are probably nine now, but who see us five at the moment, not to be left out because of the arch agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed and agreed to, we stand out, and we do not agree with this reform," he said.
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The city hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the discussed owner of the company supplying electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the town hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
The amount paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material will reach 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the City Hall's transparency page, this last cheque, number 9258447, was sent on November 16 of that year, was issued for a sum of 200,144.56 pesos, and was listed as its subject matter "to settle outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, additional amount.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will be sent in favor of Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only she is being paid what we owe her, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last one on November 16.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies inspected by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the city hall’s supplier again.
Previously, after July 25, the newspaper Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city paid more than 10 million pesos to Camach Palazuelos through 42 checks.
She also conducted transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourists are in need of maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Sanchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After a fall of a foreign tourist into a depression at the Sanchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlan is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, thus not showing the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that they repeatedly demanded that the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here, be replaced by new activities or routes.
He noted that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the revenue that's leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have addressed these issues for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The city council will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not just repairing existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, after all, even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the city hall should change its maintenance strategy of the city."
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Emblem of Mazatlan and El Venadito.
"Nowadays, in order for tourists to come, it is not just about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city abounding in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The necessary attention was not paid here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the city hall, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to make it attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces that will need to be put in order first to make these places more attractive and to be able to put them on the list that we have to promote this destination."
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Davalos, president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges the state faces.
A parliamentary period full of dignified work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive calls for the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is convulsing and facing major problems.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of the PAN, three members of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two members of the PRD, one member of the PT, one member of the Convergence Party and the last member of the PVEM Party, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they will be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), has proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great responsibility and set an example on the path to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Therefore, he spoke about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridgings that would move the ruling party forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and be primarily committed to society and sectors, because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all forces in an effort to achieve economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will boost job creation in some way."
As for tourism, he demanded that new lawmakers give it more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that this is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which moreover directly competes with agriculture".
In addition to spending funds on startup tourism projects, Congress should help deliver on the state's security and help with the Alcohol Act, which failed to resolve in previous parliamentary terms.
Looking for Three Kings
Dolls, toy cars and bicycles are, along with other toys, on the wish list of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
Their parents will find it hard to live up to their expectations of the upcoming Three Kings Day, as their household numbers exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
“Sometimes it’s hard because my husband is unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the Plebeians on the street to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfredo, he would like a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like clothes in the size of a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this was a monster car,' but I said 'we'll see, son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalls with sadness.
For older children who were just in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size 12, 10-year-old Isaías a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he could use a pair of size five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can take part in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and at the reception of the newspaper Noroeste to bring a gift or cash.
14 alleged drug traffickers who were arrested
Ten inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to make drugs.
"Approximately 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce it were seized," said Louis-Philippe Rulel, a spokesman for Quebec police.
Eleven men and three women were arrested, both alleged bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested had to appear at the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice following their arrest.
They could face charges of manufacturing Indian cannabis, its possession with the aim of trafficking in it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These searches followed a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information that we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
The police operation involved 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec State Police, Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphrémagog Police Administration.
Illegal immigration will continue without any problems.
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will clearly be defeated, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand squarely on the side of the party that has built granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow up to a year to detain any person from the ship, identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was headed for the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
An NPD critic on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be the backbone of another bill, the C-35," Ms Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it puts the blame on refugees and jails children for at least a year," Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties.
"Canadians are telling MPs en masse that they don't tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are taking Canada at gunpoint and treating it like some kind of patolisal."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney said.
The government did not call a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to vote to reject it.
A conservative told the QMI news agency that the government would ask for a vote so that any MP who opposes it would be accountable for his position to his constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is working to ensure that this idea is not forgotten: Québec intends to consult with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January next year.
The Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
This was all that was needed for the public safety critic, PQ sideman Stéphane Bergeron, to rate the announcement as a "rabbit pulled out of a hat" and an "amateur solution botched on its knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"Satisfied with confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public hearing of witnesses.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest is asserting that he doesn't want to form this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior Civil Servants.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposed to Quebec to grant a special mandate to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the Inspector General's mandate," he decided.
He also believes Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, whom they allow to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Charest government.
Quebec would also follow Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it better suited for this type of crime.
This request would be made by Operation Marteau (The Hammer), which informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of investigation was not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently looking into some of the amendments related to this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, 131 people were arrested, although the Criminal Code has not yet been amended.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses came under strict control due to heavy rainfall that had fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudiere.
The road's crooked.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. rain from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections to the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were affected the most.
It could drop up to 100 millimeters in total.
If we add up these precipitations with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of floods in some watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudiere.
Rivers to the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chone, in Lotbiniére, became subject to flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudiere, heavy rainfall caused the inundation of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In the Outaouais, the outpouring of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the commune of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on alert and overseeing the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
Quebec's Center for Flood Forecasting issued warnings on Wednesday of severe flooding for several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blasphemed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (RRTV) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to rude language during broadcasts.
The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting judges that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements included "inaccurate information about social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians crude expressions that do not correspond to broadcasts aired during the day".
The council also concluded that discussions about suicide, including broadcasting the names of the two people who took their lives, did not violate the regulations for radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council received several complaints regarding comments made during the broadcasts, aired between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of Welfare Recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts shown on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, host Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the message conveyed was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcast of "Dupont's noon reports" have come across the delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no complaint against him.
The latest dispute concerned the statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Thus, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort engaged in a media firefight that provoked many reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he did not send any donation to help the Haitians because we cannot know with certainty that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of Haitians.
"I have already made amends for my three-day postponement of the matter."
"My file has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all its decisions, the Commission refuses to use rough language in broadcasting.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated "beyond its responsibilities".
For the station, which will have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, among other things, the consequences are minimal.
King of kung fu in Montreal.
The Montreal native of Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely odd run.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the tatami and rings around the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to study with professionals.
“In my case, I look for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don’t like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and assistant for UPS, has just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from October 23 to 30, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he said."
"I am currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China."
"Competitors were invited to finish in the top four at the last World Championship in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005".
"In 2007 I finished fifth in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches and foot strokes, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches traditionally take place on a platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born of this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal is expected to retain only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda" supertournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic guy."
"It's kind of the equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"He who beat me was a true pro, he analyzed."
"There are four contenders per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"Semi-final winners will compete in their category final".
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that only one champion, the king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed 450 million in contracts with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has won the most significant contract, a $295 million contract to manage the entire project without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of the Energie gérance, was mandated in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec in 2004 to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" was awarded a lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies presents us with a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to realize collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people no longer make side agreements in secret, they are now making them openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
A little earlier in the morning, M. Simard posed this question to the National Assembly because he says it bears heavily how the public interest can be so sold.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected in the afternoon, emphatically denying that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own way", she thundered, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked accuracy".
She said that "it would be the least of it" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to group together their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of work.
Construction is already underway and must be scheduled for 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the engineering consulting consortium formula is under investigation in the government.
Flying through the business register of Quebec companies at speed will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, Dessau.
As for the consortium of the énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular that "la Baie James's territory is characterised by a particular dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
Eastmain’s principal patron, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to shrug off the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you enter a public tender and there are few bidders, your bids may be higher."
"You have two choices: that you pick up the people who are on the contract as contestants and that you say, 'Let's make a deal that's satisfactory and at a good price.'
"But the main idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the consortium of the Onergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Party of Quebec.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories performing soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin racked up 22 contracts, of which Genivar earned 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in the "Energie gérance".
All contracts have been closed.
Together, they total $449,783,344, including a contract with the company ?nergie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known Liberal parties of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also linked to the companies that "fund" her, before specifying that they are more like her executives.
Responsible consumption barometer - "green" etiquette does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in “unbiased” brands and eco-certificates, to be guided accordingly when choosing products.
The worst part is that even when we bathe in a media universe that urges us to consume more socially responsiblely, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfill obligations that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, reports Barom?tre Responsible Consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who try to sell them still do not trust them very much.
In fact, two-thirds of us say we don’t trust companies’ promises about the environment simply because companies’ green ads are finding a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates applied to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labeled as environmentally responsible, Barometer reports.
In the same way, the debate among politicians on this subject is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information about responsible consumption seems to be paramount to stimulating this side of consumption, currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and questionable nature of the information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake, identified by Barometre, after the higher price of these products.
Indeed, a third of the population of Quebekus distrusts the reported data on the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
Sixty-one percent of them favored buying from merchants in their neighborhood, preferring to buy food grown in their region, according to Baromutre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québeku likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving for the least environmental impact by taking care of the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience has apparently remained somewhere outside their car, reports Barometre: in 2010, barely 28% of the population of Quebec said they use public transport or that they recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in the interest of nature conservation.

State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallele, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The Angus et le Parallele development company, which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard, and which proved its mission as a film art lover, did not get what it wanted.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebec proposed a loan, the amount of which would have been lower, some initial expectations, which could have built the basis for a viable solution on favorable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million was already rejected by Quebek last spring, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan were sent by Minister St-Pierre to the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), Francois Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallele et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Let us recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinema Centres in Quebec opposed direct investment by the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, concluding that the Minister of Culture should not finance the real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, received film art in his cinemas during ten years after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for the change by the State Finance Council.
The lack of halls for independent films is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallele, with Christian Yaccarini at the helm, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will raise $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
As of the spring of 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallale, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and screen Xavier Beauvois' most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that are being made to him.
Lifting the curtain on Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic American sources made known by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but in the same stroke they reveal their sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
U.S. diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter has Canada-U.S. relations at heart when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, including one from the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and one from Washington, provide sensitive details to get under each other’s skin.
The announcement, dated September 22, 2008, i.e. in the midst of an election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets being discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian inferiority complex, almost stuck, is conditioning perhaps political leaders to talk about internal stakes instead of realizing that this election also applies to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
"The United States is, therefore," he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less as both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or even better, a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your path will help ensure that the government maintains a vote of confidence in early February regarding the federal budget, to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade, over a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan,” writes M. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, highlights Washington's increasingly negative picture of the United States being cast in drama series aired on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O broadcasts, in which not-so-sophisticated references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for the purpose of violent interrogations at the CIA can be observed.
At their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some Guantánamo detainees.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper relating to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to the Secretary of State."
"Secrets Accepted With File Revised".
Finally, note that people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World Plan for Lighting Restoration
The United Nations has proposed a plan in Cancun to restore home lighting, shop lighting and industrial space in 100 countries with the aim of achieving a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one-third of the additional limitation that needs to be achieved to stabilize the planet’s climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement reduction commitments on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace incandescent bulbs that monopolize 50 to 70% of the market with fluorescent or, even better, light-emitting diode (DEL) bulbs, a significant amount of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet generated by lighting would be degraded.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world’s emissions.
That’s equivalent to 70% of the world’s car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But 5 Gt will have to be subtracted from this balance in order to achieve a 2 degrees Celsius stabilization of climate heating by 2020 in order to exclude that it will not get out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluo-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs with DEL, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluo-compact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL light bulbs, such as the one launched by Philips this week - the company reportedly participated in a UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a incandescent light bulb, giving us an idea of the possible savings with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluo-compact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection centres.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact light bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants, which emit much of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put into circulation 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the gains that would be made from this international program by each country.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants costing $2.5 billion to build.
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the elections.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, called for the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and to report the preliminary results without delay," a spokesman for the U.N. president stressed.
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the latest date - Wednesday midnight - to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission "continues to work" to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment by the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" voting in the north, administered by former New Army (FN) insurgents since a failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country had discouraged supporters of the President of Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
Elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council takes into account complaints filed by Gbagbo.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, President Gbagbo's very close political ally.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, denounced the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was seen as crowning the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political group on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote versus 32% for Alassano Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), according to provisional seasonal variation correction (CVS) figures released by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilized at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for a job.
The current situation of young people in the labour market has intensified with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed.
As for the elderly, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months as well as a year), that is 482,000 people over 50 and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 recorded benefits from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after making it 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini has been charged and placed in custody.
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of the waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into procurement allegedly fraudulently obtained.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with misappropriation of company assets, misappropriation of public funds and public property, concealment, providing bribes, receiving bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions he intends to ask him, not any delusions."
“It’s easy to persecute him for many reprehensible reasons, but it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini stated through his lawyers that he had sent a brief statement to the judge before his questioning to clarify everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he never knew of any such thing, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former general manager of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was charged on Wednesday with misappropriation of public funds and conspiracy, and left at liberty,under judicial supervision with a ban to associate, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to give an explanation to all the facts that are reproached to him."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and leaves him at liberty," said his attorney, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, saying they were under judicial surveillance over two of them, said Deputy State's Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy CEO with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes in order to influence the office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michale Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "the theft and misuse of the company's assets", the other for "complicating the misuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealing the misuse of the company's assets".
Among those confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently indicted in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies helped launder money from widespread gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted as part of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill at La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the municipal community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée Palace exaggerated Syria mediation
Over a period of more than a decade, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", united views in France, put diplomacy on combat alert and highlighted relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this has been closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how leading French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the U.S. judiciary for the fraudulent trafficking of material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they are putting the spotlight on the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't really do anything about it.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
An adviser from the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, Francois Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do just as much to bring back their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "constantly forcefully pronounce "in the media the words "fundamental rights of man", "innocence", "immediate deliverance".
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, must be brought into difficulty.
“Do it the more they ask you to stop.”
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “masters of evasive maneuvers.”
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purpose of 'political blackmail.'"
He announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French embassy gives her refuge) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (a deposit of 230,000 euros).
And he will announce that the Elysee Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians could "arrest another roughly 1,800 French people living in Iran in the future," he says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information spreads: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims has been expelled for illegal trafficking of electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris following a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which pursues illegal Iranian networks to acquire material destined for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France agreed to negotiate?
The liberation of an Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Francois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he states, was not only "surprised by this judge's decision", but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There were talks between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michale Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision", he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Elysee Palace dials the phone number, hangs up the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings administered by the Iranian Embassy."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized "escapes" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a "significant" and "influence" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation bears fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes a media "blest" of French officials".
What is the basis for such a measure of "gratitude" towards M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements, full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's policy of opening up Syria", he analyzes.
The policy pursued in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region".
It also aims to “sow a grain of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier told him, "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is."
“But we thanked them.”
"This should at least bring confusion and confusion among Iranians".
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysee Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrywoman".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Pecival" that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask companies running online games to block access to those games after midnight to people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe this bill is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a senior ministry official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it, a responsible worker added.
It will also make free programs available to people who request it, allowing them to limit their time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspected corruption, Fifa's executive committee sets out Thursday's host countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a sovereignly political-motivated selection where the struggle for influence and lobbying risk surpassing technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the royal competition Fifa in 2018will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after premiering on the African continent in 2010, or continuing to establish itself in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations run the risk of taking up to the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) dossiers contain the best arguments, as well as the dossiers of their competitors.
But these reasons won't hold much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour set for voting.
At the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE /European Commission? / for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which so far has hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
The BBC crowned it on Monday when it aired a documentary that "pinned" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and embarrass an English leader with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, in 2005 to win the 2012 London Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair Spain-Portugal do not miss the trumps of already prepared stadiums,its good looks (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal allusions barely twisted to accuse the English press of members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Mr Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite, with its considerable experience in 1994.
The world’s highest-performing economy, home to Fifa’s main sponsors, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem premature for both countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa ardently desires, has made the Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out a big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for the fee-paying TV (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, creating a driving force for Fifa.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand seemed to hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if the doubts constantly persist.
In one sense and another.
In 2006, unbelievably, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims that a third mandate would not be ruled out.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy said that he would "decide sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminds members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown little feverish state.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The president only recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken in such a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years to go with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; they will not make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it is because of the double truth.
Speeding up the path to candidacy for PS, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to Ségoléna Royale's arena, which is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS want the arrangement into the battle lines premature rather than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Francois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," people from the immediate vicinity of the prime minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He will still believe he can win," Alain Juppé corrects, leveling with the obvious.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting from the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The sovereign European debt crisis obliges, the institute for issuing securities will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation now so tense on European securities markets.
In this case, the political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of resolving the European states' claims.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example, by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)".
The night before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he was content to say that the program of buying state titles in the secondary market was "continued" and that "we will see how we decide" during the session that takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: The central bank will keep its core fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, bond purchases made by the Central European Bank doubled to nearly 1.35 billion euros in the past week.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of the market negotiators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the anticipators about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in the exchange rate.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the European Central Bank’s arsenal, the latter bank shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquid funds on generous terms and for a duration of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in a significant way."
“If not, it would mean accepting the risk of creating a new short-term tension,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive baseline announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds: “The European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of its bond purchases in order to reinvigorate a weak market.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It needs to compensate for the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent a flare-up in the paid performance of the most fragile countries," a senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, countries will worry all the more about reducing their debt instead of stabilizing it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi humpback
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation eased a little, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy, the presidents of the regions said that they had heard Giulia Tremonti classifying the situation as "unsolvable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied to the participants.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared up to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, described himself as "too busy" with "stormy market developments" and a possible contagion originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that he’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is its lack of growth and lack of significant fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis, at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the general government deficit will still represent 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of the new sum of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, new tough measures will have to be taken,” said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For now, Italy is accepting support from international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Directors under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, not even short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of 2011 GDP, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required in Italy are less than those required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE's chief economist.
The issue is political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, elections could begin, which are expected at the end of March.
This would open a period of time that is not suitable for taking a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening their anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think the Europeans have demonstrated this all day and all night on Sunday, they are obviously very committed to solidarity, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s recorded expansion regarding interest on European government bonds brought water to the mill for governments and the Central European Bank.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's notation office has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, the target most targeted by various speculations.
“Because there is a real lack of transparency and clarity in May, based mainly on banking systems,” Exane BNP Paribas said.
“Political time is slower than market time.”
Conscious of this broken connection and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most affected by the problem, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
The Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings will take place from the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank is meeting today.
Unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets are on the agenda (see above).
As far as the European Fund for Finance (FESF) is concerned, its Managing Director, Klaus Regling, embarked on a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of this trip is not to increase funds, it certainly paves the way for achieving this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilized funds through additional direct engagement with the FMI.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that attach to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before they apply their own budgetary adjustments and before they decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain their continued confidence.
Finally, the capital participants in European funds are talking about options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to tap the stock of securities again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the very first plan of trade in European sovereign debt, believe that the addition of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
There is a means: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized to this day by EUR 60 billion.
The Council, which has all the chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially as market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange alert.
Snow rations still cause difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-S-vres a la Vienne, have joined the 20 districts that have already declared orange alert, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowstorms cause problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes, and weak snowfall on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistere, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowstorms are big enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and police recommend driving out with your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for this day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned on Thursday.
No special measures are foreseen on Wednesday evening to limit freight traffic.
The district office "calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt driving to the nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to expected snowfall.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Billions have been raining since the debate on modernising Ile-de-France.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we are recalling the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to be able to start the construction, the state announced a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
Purely in theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for its contracts.
Today we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is being reviewed by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set up to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is estimated: "The yield of this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists in order "to modernise it, to increase the yield obtained from it and to make this increase affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
A mirage.
This is not stated in the text.
Up to 4 billion is far away.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are being added to the 4 billion euros of capital subsidy that will be mobilized by the state and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we created the revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then rake up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed".
SGP believes that 4 billion will be credited only in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belong to still absent subscribers, risks triggering a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on December 7.
Vengeful hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about Berlusconi's sex life are announced by what anyone could read in any newspaper for months (all except these two Berlusconi own), and the infamous cartoon profile of Gaddafi has long been a subject for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of reports already known is crucial in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore that deals with esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to look for reports about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret service (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, an editor in the Libération newspaper) who only takes for granted what he himself admits to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department was the same that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
Why, then, was there so much fuss about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since the time when heads of state can make phone calls or fly away to dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed themselves into spy centers.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public dishonors the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not a negligible one, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "executors".
But let's get from here to the deep truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in the time of Orwell, it was possible to conceive of all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell’s prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every move through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, the citizen became a total victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it is now, that even "graves" with the most secret information of the powerful can not resist the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can he maintain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious empty secret, because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secret was empty secrets.
WikiLeaks made no mistake about Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the bequeathed power?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be tantamount to its publication on a poster posted on a street corner.
But it’s also perfectly obvious that with current technology, it’s pointless to hope that you can keep a message secret over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know my prognosis is science fiction for the moment, and it is fantastic, but I must imagine government officials carrying discreetly the completion of formalities along uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide precious information in the heel of their shoes.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in key-closed drawers: all in all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated the wire-based (telephone) telegraph.
Videotapes (analogs) allowed cinema lovers to shoot the film step by step, moving it forward and backward and revealing all the secrets of the montage, while now CDs (numerical) allow only to jump through chapters, that is, macroporces.
By high-speed trains we arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while to travel by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not uncommon for politics and communication techniques to revert to horse-drawn carriages.
One last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been arranged in secret by the embassy.
Now it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Hacked Its Finance Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test compliance with promises for fast-unblocked funding (fast-start or early-start) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks have been revealed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros for three years, and France has pledged 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million euros per year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU pulled out a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report detailing the action of its member states, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation priceless and valued for its real value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do it in the same way and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announced that it had mobilised EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its promise of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without harming Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be the reference year: international funding has been maintained and it is adding 150 million for three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
On the other hand, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease) to meet its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is not yet a rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some people, such as France, think that 1 euro borrowed is equal to 1 euro donated.
Clearly, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be substantiated for some investments that are profitable (often emissions reduction projects involving more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it as the price of a loan to a creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France can only give such a justification: it is "keeping" its commitment of 420 million euros, 91.5% of which is a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify this for yourself.
It is the only country in the European Union that uses a loan of this scale.
Germany demanded 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) adhere to their obligations with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1 euro to satisfy its promise, France gives only 10 centimes and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful juggler's piece!
To sum up, in its financing of the "fast start" France operates with a double sham: on the one hand with the development of the stock over time and on the other with the real financial burden.
Despite spending only 36.1 million euros, he is able to convince that he is spending 420 million euros "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early funding is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and fairness and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But most of all, France should avoid discussing long-term financing contributions (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or how to post loans.
France should change its stance to become as progressive on these deposits as it is on others.
So everyone is putting their hope in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who is coming to Cancun next week.
The startling announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to advance the discussions.
Pesticide alarm for children.
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Rights Movement and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "do not have a significant statistical value given the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the issue being processed", bought between July and September foods commonly eaten in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child of roughly ten years old in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate’s balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five are clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see well in our research that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE, is striking,” the association states.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea themselves contain about ten résiduums with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in the luncheon, where studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, canned tuna and even bun and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
Salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave oven did not escape analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this "contaminant cocktail" is likely to be underestimated," the study concludes.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Association (EE-LV) has proposed a "face-to-face emergency" to set up a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt "the rise of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of them in cereals.
