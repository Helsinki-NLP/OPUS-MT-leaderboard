A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners struggle to find the money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that can easily fit into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that monitor every kilometre that a motorist drives and transmit that information to the authorities are at the heart of Washington’s controversial effort to renovate America’s outdated main road funding system.
The usually tedious design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these little lockers to record mileage and possibly where you’re going, and then use that information to compile a tax assessment.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays per kilometer of the road he is driving on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“This is not a matter of choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who plans to start tracking mileage for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology serves this purpose.
The incentive is that the U.S.-funded road trust fund at gas stations is at rock bottom.
Americans aren’t buying as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by even one cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently placed tracking devices in 500 cars to test this payment system per kilometre driven.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers driven.
Unsurprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planners look to this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (a Pennsylvania representative), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees this as the most functional long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation’s free market representatives are also keen on the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transportation ministers, who urged Congress in 2011 to move toward paying per kilometer.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives leadership rejected the proposal, and did so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing sections of the population whose daily lives often mean covering many miles for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most zealous is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state tax for mileage, instead of the gasoline tax.
Nevada has completed its pilot project.
New York is investigating the project.
Illinois does this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) are studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have an advocate.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
“Worrying about Big Brother surveillance and similar issues has been a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn’t something that people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website, "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles the car will drive, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has led some state agencies to a small California company called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market of legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device that it tests attracts the attention of road network designers, as it does not use GPS and only provides a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go for it if you don’t track their speed and their location,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometers traveled by all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope the cautious public will embrace the concept if the device can do more, not less.
In the city of New York, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra parking-hour fees, provide mileage-based insurance, and collect speed data from other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to participate in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s design document states.
However, some transport planners would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometer are just a huge proxy problem.
Officials at the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could easily solve the bankrupt trust fund problem by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when aspirin is plentiful,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka negotiates for ČSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people and the Babišs talk to each other and plan a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats get it right within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners who will put a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The emissaries of the ČSSD then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to take control of the political forum and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only him so far, other team members will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologised to the members of the Bureau and now to the citizens.
You shouldn’t lie in public or in your personal life.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek said after the meeting.
He added that he did not hold the position of First Vice-President.
"I will announce my decision to the Central Committee on November 10," Hašek said.
The vice-president of the ČSSD, Zdeněk Škromach, and the head of the parliamentary club, Jeroným Tejc, spoke similarly.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then said they would do everything possible to make the 50-member ČSSD club sound with one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre saying: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I respected the decision of the party authorities."
Another lie in the air.
Or perhaps, when calling for Sobotka’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, he forgot that the Central Committee of the People’s Congress decided by 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, by convening the Central Committee only next Sunday, produced a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of the 192 members of this body and the media with all sorts of gossip and rumors, eventually recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be a powerful fight of dirty laundry, there will be hints of dark alliances between the coal bar Zdeněk Bakala and the Sobotka wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The Ostrava mayor and Sobotka’s ally, Petr Kajnar, said: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If the Central Committee had met this weekend, liars would probably have been forced to sacrifice their functions in a ritual way.
Traitors sprinkle ashes on their heads and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will end with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doktor on the problems with the Sochi Olympics: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just exhales deeply: "It's challenging."
According to Martin Doktor, cooperation with the organizing team of the 2014 Sochi Olympics is a bit more complicated.
We can forget what happened at the Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way," the head of the Czech Olympic mission said.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of supplying information on essential things.
Maybe we’ve liked them for three months now to give us the official designation of each village so that we can do a lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
They are always communicating on many things.
Is there an Olympic Village?
But it is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the house is still standing.
What does it mean to be empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, so that was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26 as a vanguard, he will still smell the glue.
And if they don't, what will?
Do you think President Putin would put an army there?
That's how it's gonna go down.
Just so it's not that Olympic villages = Potemkin villages.
Rather, there is a risk that, for example, they will not be able to adjust the roads, they will not finish the details.
Maybe they'll have their journeys in such a state that we'll have to take the boots from the London games with us.
But I'm sure they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria this number changes.
Maybe the skaters will go in the three that went out.
No one has to doubt about the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'm not supposed to go until January 26th.
What will the houses in the Olympic village look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by metro, so as not to believe only sketches.
There are a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a common agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin Promises Ecological Olympics, Plans to Destroy Giant Secret Landfills
Fans of winter sports are already cutting a meter until the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympic Games, which will not start until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians do not seem to be able to fulfill the promise that the preparations and holding of the games will not in the slightest disturb the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians set the bar very high, the Canadian Games have been inscribed in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long since passed.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a huge construction material dump in the village of Achštyr near Soča.
In August, environmentalists found a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foams, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities were defecating and the dump disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a view of a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, several have been created in the area of such places, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian railways, a state monopoly, are working on the site, building a roughly 60-kilometer road between Sochi Airport and the sports resort.
The business, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways resisted that the landfill had been set up by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here will contaminate Sochi's water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimayev, of the environmental NGO EWNC, told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost only $19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver 9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on the exhibition of sports facilities and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers will deal with the new law during the games, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the plot itself is somewhat sloping.
The requirement further stated that the house would be inhabited by two generations who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"When creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected through the exterior of the building in several ways, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' household is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are connected.
Individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the final finish of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using plank panels, the part where the office is plastered white, and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete finish without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very intertwined with the exterior.
The parents' household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
Connecting the interior with the exterior underlines the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there ascends the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is what the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and give it something unique.
The household of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen part, a dining room and a living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with a sliding door.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the household of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall, and from there rises up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters to students, teachers and the management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedom against the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I have had more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the Honorary President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received reprisals in the form of a non-invitation to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were not so brave and visit of Miloš Zeman made possible: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice we meet with the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
The newly elected MP for ODS, the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's not really the same as staying in the role of mayor of a small town, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD hetmans, who simultaneously claim the position of a deputy and a hetman and, like them, degrade both professions?
This tells people that they can handle both of these demanding functions with the left rear.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hašek, who can handle several dozen functions at once.
This is probably not an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of Dr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who left the parliamentary post in order to fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of Dean is that the concurrence of the functions will violate the apolitical nature of the academic grounds of the University of Pardubice.
The management of ODS in Pardubice sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your school without becoming a dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion as me and rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may get counted by the voters in the next election.
And it doesn’t have to be long-lasting.
In Kunovice bubbles of cabbage, chemistry does not add to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut will be produced in the coming months in Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started in October and will last about six months.
Since 1925, it has been producing healthy delicacies in the traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large dances.
This is a rarity in modern industrial times.
Our employees will find a nearly ten-kilometer route for the shift.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, it takes three shifts to fill one," said David Kladroba, plant director at Slovácká Fruta.
Head cabbages are transported to the company’s premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko.
The employees of Fruta then clean the vegetables, remove the brooms and throw them into a circle.
From there, the already sliced cabbage falls into pools six meters deep, in which pedals dressed in white clothes and boots work tirelessly.
This removes unwanted air.
The last layer of sauerkraut is covered with tarpaulin and loaded with water.
"The cabbage is then matured for six to eight weeks under spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," Kladroba said.
The natural process corresponds to the production in house conditions, the individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
The cabbage after fermentation goes to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweet-sour pickle in bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “cooperate” with Germany over U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a whistle-blower from the U.S. intelligence services, has announced that he is willing to go to Berlin to present evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which he handed over to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as fugitives and seeks to criminalise political speech with heavy lawsuits that leave no room for defence."
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop criminal charges filed against him.
The charges filed by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to mount when allegations surfaced that the NSA was eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there were any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness "without exposing himself to danger and that relations with the US would be completely destroyed", this should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo on Twitter with Mr. Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe” there, a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the whole world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the board and senior officials, including those in the United States, have reviewed the revelations of an unwarranted system of pervasive surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
We are sorry for the killing, but we are innocent, Khmer Rouge officials defend
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge government, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions.
The commander of the notorious S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charged with genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the true extent of the killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge to "treat or kill people, to deny them food, or to commit genocide."
He said he was "morally responsible" for the deaths.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che's apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be exonerated."
“He doesn’t care about the other one,” she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
Ieng Sary, the “foreign minister” of the Khmer Rouge regime, was also due to appear in court, but he died in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent by the court in September 2012 due to dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in their announcement on Wednesday they said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new carry-on baggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small bags under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers wait to pay until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was meant to encourage travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge that fee,” she said.
Airlines began charging for first and second-hand baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and crammed into hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really isn't to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring in luggage for which they will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure passengers learn about the charge before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new carry-on fee will not be in effect until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see an additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost Allegiant Air followed suit later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says aviation advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when passengers met Spirit's unusual fee for hand luggage.
“Getting on the plane was the smoothest I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see gnashing teeth and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the boarding took place in an instant.”
Frontier will also apply charges for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit’s example.
Frontier said passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the entire can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
The water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to introduce drink charges in 2008, but after passenger complaints, it withdrew seven months later and no other major airline emulated it.
Frontier’s latest move to charge for hand luggage, if passengers do not purchase the flight directly from the airline, is its latest effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to buy directly from them instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, it started giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half of their miles as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the miles from that trip.
So a 1000-mile journey with Frontier through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and it is losing money.
According to financial results reported on Wednesday by corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
By selling the airline, Republic is also trying to solve Frontier’s financial problems.
The NSA is not blaming hackers for the website crash, but an “internal error”
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that its website crashed for hours last week due to an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some have claimed on the internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site remained inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” compromised.
The spokesman said that no classified information is compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for shutting down NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers overload and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has become the focus of public attention after a string of foreign and domestic surveillance programs were exposed, and the product of the NSA’s theft of secret files from the agency and their disclosure by a disillusioned former employee, Edward Snowden, has been the target of scathing criticism.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit fell due to a drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, due to fewer orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in the train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its new CSeries-type aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether the aircraft would comply with an ambitious plan to begin commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates, and shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the rating from “higher yields” to “sector performance” on Thursday, expecting the exchange to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While smaller aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, the profit margin in the transport sector disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a message to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market scepticism towards this program to increase.
Bombardier hopes to push the CSeries to the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was revealed in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers wait for the test flight results to verify the company's claims regarding the low fuel consumption and cost savings of this airliner.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft went into commercial use.
Senior executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates, and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks, and the others shortly after.
Analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing, while consistent with Bombardier’s internal roadmap, is likely to strengthen our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as at 30 September, which does not change even on 31 December.
“The results in aviation were consistent with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in the division increased nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport orders amounted to 32.6 billion as of 30 September, a marginal increase compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Managers said new outlooks will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, announced a 10 percent decline in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned mobsters about police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information to the Underworld King Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who briefed a drug mobster on a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to pass on sensitive information to the head of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough, after he became suspected of cocaine use.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" (party) and hailed by criminals as the top legal counsel, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police followed Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics cases.
Police spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine in his lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, which was just having dinner with his Law Society colleagues.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
During an eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to covertly obtain information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were under surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After the police seized some 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine along with 200,000 pounds in cash during a series of raids, 32 more people ended up in prison along with them.
Ditta, 42, was passing information on to criminals for fear of becoming addicted to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, experienced a shameful moment before Liverpool’s Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing the administration of justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after it was discovered during a police investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recording his arrival at Ditt's house and seeing him place drugs of 60 percent purity under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was having dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two people.
In court, it was said that there were traces of Class A drug in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using the cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls under "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards from it, but all were detained and hair samples were taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and in the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work-related matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more aware that they must not violate the law than a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a solicitor and of coming into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation thwarted as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring his profession a good reputation, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be eroded.
Ditta rejected the offense, stating, "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to give Mr Scarborough information, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal himself from being a criminal solicitor when he started to obtain drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime groups, which gave him the task of gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should inspire confidence and a sense of trust in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crimes Unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditto, which also convicted him of three cocaine possession cases and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death cell block in America, as a dinner guest he would want Mohammed Ali, and as an incentive for work he cited inequality.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal sent against Babis.
The People's Party won 14 seats in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
However, they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who under the People's Party tuned the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates, as this year's talks unfold.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
“It’s a scary piece of news and it’s time to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspaper said.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the world’s most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government's hand" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to MPs," he said.
According to Star, the bill effectively gives the government “complete control over the media,” and Standard reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have “suffered a severe blow,” and criticizes the bill as “strict.”
The approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media turned on the authorities when they broadcast a surveillance camera footage of soldiers allegedly robbing a luxury goods store at the scene of the attack.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a senior media officer called in for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of being “taken off the list” or be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to wipe out most radio stations.”
It is also reported that these measures may have a deleterious impact on what is called Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
Politicians know that when they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“You never know what might happen,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Legislators in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their fat salaries of around 532,000 tax-free shillings per month, which are among the highest in the world.
They have to save themselves, the young Czechs know.
Most of them have no idea what interest rates are.
More and more Czechs are putting money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in the region.
The largest amount of money is saved by Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros a month.
A little more than the Czechs save people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey conducted by the Erste Savings Barometer Group in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of respondents plan to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people saving products still use very little.
For example, almost every second Serb, according to the survey, saves at home "under the pillow".
This year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents set aside between 1,000 and 2,500 crowns each month for various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit in year-on-year comparison decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way of valuing savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is decreasing, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also decreased significantly.
Only 16% of respondents use it, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they are making on individual products.
Young people under the age of 30 don’t know how much their money is worth.
On the other hand, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their deposited money, 73 percent of people over fifty years of age know this.
In international comparison, Erste Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44% of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% margin.
United Nations announces new targets to fight poverty
The United Nations is urgently beginning work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing through the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit overnight that now was the time to “raise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique’s founder’s president, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to shout peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she replaced her corporate outfit with a T-shirt adorned with the words “We demand safety” in Portuguese, joining a crowd in Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, some of the worst skirmishes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous insurgent movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that open conflict is unlikely to re-emerge in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of large offshore oil and coal reserves in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion worth of investment over the next few years from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and America’s Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government sparked recent conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
Violent attacks by former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked Renamo's party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflicts, saying it was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza was trying to ease fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French news agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever he had left to try to prove that he could order the government to make its own decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim they want to avoid war.
Concerns were raised, however, when Mr. Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told France’s FT newspaper that he meant the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness,” Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease tensions between these parties, fueled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It’s a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been pushing for electoral changes, has already said it would boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a dying movement to gain benefits and financial gain from the government.
The electoral share of the Renamo party has been decreasing since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the election.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
“He doesn’t want a multiparty democratic system, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to let go of the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but he has carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely when exporting coal.
In June, Rio suspended use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the country's future lies solely with the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Protester Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Tales of Thor may show that "gross power cannot equal clever cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would be “too wild to teach in school, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates age-appropriate careful selection of works.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk creation are already part of education,” he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are like a “turn-off” for a gripping story with a “subliminal” message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and British National Tales, says, “You can have good intentions, but you’ll do better if you keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors to space in a new digital environment
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the large planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can immerse themselves in the new comfortable seats and over their heads a projection area of 17 meters in diameter in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"There are twenty-one computers that generate images," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"Computer performance is thirty to forty times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
Digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the ocean floor.
Audiences find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen purchased programmes and its own creations in the hall.
There have been two shows since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of astronauts, fly into space, spin on the centrifuge, and then see on illustrative examples what challenging conditions astronauts face in space.
The second show is for children and is called The Magic Cliff - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment when the nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest were swallowed by audio-visual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to Dušek, between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
We have 11 thousand advertisers!
We know where you want to go to work!
Last November, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is becoming the most important medium for posting job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it stabilised at around 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities reflects the current situation on the labour market to a large extent.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and during the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reporting period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
In contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including workers’ ones, said Pavlína Št'astnová, the author of the analysis.
The degree of representation of the selected professional groups varies between the two media.
On the Internet, top positions were taken by advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small business leaders was only featured on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs mainly to the service and workers' professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer.
Other areas of interest included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only two percent of the ads required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims of 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Requirements for practice are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
The workers’ professions are mainly mechanics and repairers, producers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, added Jiří Tillner, the author of the study.
Employers also include requirements on the characteristics and skills of potential candidates in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills have been appearing in advertising for a long time.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in both small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and become successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio and television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominence with his sitcom (jokes up a spicy "League" on a fantasy-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," but was best known for her fast-paced video series "Marcel the shell with shoes on."
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognisable voices (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, scathing, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest pulls of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the aisle between two buildings and says, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil fell further to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high stocks were offset by a report showing a strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil supply index fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late-morning European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange.
Thursday's drop was 39 cents, and for the month of October, it lags by 5.8%.
Over the past few weeks, rich oil reserves have weighed on the price.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports of Chinese production came a stimulus to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounding to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent crude, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Oh, no, Mr. Hašek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
There must be such pressure that Martin Hašek is removed from all political posts and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so scanty.
Martin Hašek defends himself with the promise he made, but everyone and the politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He does not apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Hašek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm this, if you did not lie - here you can see how complicated it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made the mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be a proud, even a flawed person or a lifelong skete.
It may seem unfair to you to address only you, but you are the leader and they are the misguided sheep.
You are a leader and have always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to bend your ears for a while, rearrange your forces, sit out the embarrassment, and then attack again, but that's what guerrillas or traitors do.
You are, I repeat, the leader in your eyes, the alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
Court Blocks Order on NY Police Department's Procedure for Stopping and Searching Persons
The Federal Court of Appeals on Thursday blocked a court order demanding changes to the program to stop and search people in the New York City Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Second U.S. Federal Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until a decision on the appeal was filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its conclusions and its amending regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its practices and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge must be removed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge to avoid appearances of bias, in part due to a series of interviews with the media and a public statement by which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unfairly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It established independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reform in procedures, training, and oversight, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some areas where people are most often stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police search.
An oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of stopping and searching people has been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been a halt and search of people for about a decade, but the recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg rose dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's arrest and search program argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the NYPD, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but will not solve the wider problem of the police force being under pressure after its numbers have fallen by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way NYPD searches were implemented.
One-fifth of shopping malls have low traffic
This is according to real estate advisory firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague’s Bohnice shopping centre opens to the public, it will be the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are currently 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center with respect to the location and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and unclear arrangement of passages, or dead places of the centers," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle’s head of retail real estate, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping malls are struggling with low traffic.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in a given place.
Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at the beginning.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping malls need to do more to ‘attract’ their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, even in some centres it is increasing, because the landlords were willing to discount the rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects that are not fully occupied have recently been opened and the average occupancy has been reduced (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)" added Soták.
According to Sylvie Samadi, shopping centres opened in the last two years are very slow to establish themselves on the market.
There is a market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centers', aimed at purchases and services of daily necessities for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
Also, according to Soták, there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centers.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague, he sees a space for the upcoming shopping center on Vítězné náměstí, as well as the clear potential of Na Příkopě and Václavské náměstí streets.
"The expansion of retail parks, which allow retailers to cover and expand into increasingly smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, is also developing intensively, and there is still space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstructions, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to verify a tip
Former News of the world (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” methods to confirm a fraudulent tip on a love affair that then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
Attorney Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World had picked up fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but it was reported in court that Coulson had also called her and left her voicemails.
“The attorney general suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but a person who likes to tell people stories to see what they say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of exploring stories: hacking into the phone, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, she knows about the other one, surveillance, she needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, “Of course he knows.”
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's news reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
While Ms. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup oversaw Mrs. Pawlby's motion tracking.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, saying, "I've got a story we're going to release tomorrow that I'd love to talk to Charles about."
Mr Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was similar to that of other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was said that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck, and Weatherup all confessed to hacking into the phone.
NSA revelations increase social paranoia of state surveillance
One quiet day at the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. Forward Patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and the action triggered an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and German foreign ministers.
In September, James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, again insisted that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But ever since Edward Snowden, who has become an informant, began revealing his valuable collection of covert surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading entrepreneurs no longer know whether to trust the CEO’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about state surveillance has reached new dimensions.
The final straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then surely leading entrepreneurs are also a potential target.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies more transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy EY, German companies believe that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much risk as China.
However, there is so far no evidence in all of the documentation uncovered by Mr. Snowden that the United States was passing on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet skills, saying it should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are sceptical about this.
The German parliament has said that we should make a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn’t have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the industry.
The extent and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking to some companies, who so far thought that China was the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have become more aware that data stored in the US falls under their jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-US members have canceled plans to use a cloud provider based in the US after the discovery of the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
“This has been a major topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
In general, business leaders do not want to brag about the countermeasures they have taken in order not to give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory stick at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BfV office advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are market leaders in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in its report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate documents in February listed France next to Russia and Israel in the second row of perpetrators who engage in hacking activities for economic correspondents, right behind China.
A board member at a German risk-free company concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal news agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know quite well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of Georgia Teenage Boy Who Died in Strange Accident Believes He Was Murdered
The parents of a Georgia underage boy whose body was found inside a creamy wrestling ghost in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found dead on January 11th in a spiritual state behind the bleachers at the high school gym he attended.
Lowndes County Sheriff's Department investigators conclude that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son has been murdered," Benjamin Crump, a lawyer who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
“They think it’s contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, and also to common sense,” Crump said.
They think it's to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
“As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag,” he said.
State's Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated Johnson had died as a result of "positional suffocation."
The second autopsy, however, indicated a different cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if in the case of Johnson's death he reveals enough evidence for a warrant to investigate a crime or civil rights violation, he will ask the FBI and its execution.
A deputy sheriff's office from the Lowndes precinct was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all surveillance camera footage that investigators had viewed.
The teenager's parents hope that the video footage will contain a clue leading to the discovery of how their son died.
CDC issues guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help with childhood food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the US government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how to make the teaching staff aware of children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline at their disposal, most often using an automatic EpiPen injector to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child may say, “It’s like someone’s pricking my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue is itchy.”
Parents of intersex children can choose "indefinite sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender in children born with ambiguous sex organs.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any gender for such children, and allows them to indicate gender on their birth certificates as "indeterminate" or "unspecified".
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to hastily opt for sex-determination surgery on their child, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person said after many years, “I am neither male nor female.”
I'll remain a mess made by doctors, bruised and scarred.
An estimated 2,000 babies are born each year to one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to determine it, instead of waiting and watching the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,” he said.
Determining gender can be done without surgery, and then it can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child develops sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender but to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and the genital tract, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the work area, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys of no gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “genderless” person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her status as an “indeterminate” sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have a third designation, X, in addition to M (male) and F (female), for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a news report on France 24, the issue of gender is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also defined itself against the German law, writing: “As the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are overturning two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the babies be given gender at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful without any restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek, who had a double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that gender was something like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, saying that sexual affiliation is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was malleable.
He coined the new term "gender" and argued that social causes and environmental influences - how parents raised their child - affected children's genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
He recommended to the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to a badly performed circumcision, to let their child be completely castrated, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had his surgery back on the boy and married a woman.
He committed suicide at the age of 38.
Drescher said that some doctors still use “this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations emerged "dissatisfied with the outcome."
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex drive.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfactory life."
And so, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from his outer organs and testicles and raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent for a scabbard surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex-developmental disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to men, took doses of testosterone and had his breasts removed,
The surgeries caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of California-based Advocates for informed choice, worries that the German law “calls for branding and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose ‘indeterminate’ for the child,” she said.
We are afraid that this will prompt intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don’t know how the law will ultimately sound, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australia's law because it "allows adults to choose to be included in the third gender".
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender,” she said.
German law is going to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a young child should not be fighting at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said German law would “give powers” to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because its androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
He has a vagina, but he doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Katie, 29, is now married and working as an intern in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
“The law will give parents some space not to rush their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to take certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine - you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You don’t have to rush into an operation that’s irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender to identify with more - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
A drunkard spilled gasoline all over the house: He threatened to burn it down with his own family!
The tension increased, the fear increased.
The man threatened to burn the house down.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of a corps of volunteer firefighters, went to the site.
There was also a police negotiator who tried to talk the men out of their irrational behavior.
The man threatened to burn the house down.
The house had to be entered by a task force, which disarmed and bound the man.
The aggressor then ended up being examined in a hospital in Mladá Boleslav, from where he was transported to an anti-alcoholic detention station.
Firefighters eventually showered the house with a sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition to the animals, all the animals were rescued from the house.
The man did not give up on the police negotiator, so a commando followed him.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list.
This revelation is the highlight of the highly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and announced Thursday night that the president's top associates held intensive group meetings and polls in late 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes for re-election.
According to national-policy correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House Office Chief Bill Daley, to measure what effect a move by former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of Vice President would have on the election.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House top advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew that this change was being considered.
The book, Double Down, claims that Daley was a representative of Biden’s efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the list would “not substantially increase Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve been researching a lot of things, and this was one of them,” Daley said.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we thought, “Christ, what are we supposed to do?”
While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made considerable investments to see if the move paid off in the election.
“You don’t spend that kind of money on elections and qualitative research unless you’re seriously considering something,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about this potential shuffle.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of the potential changes, the former bureau chief admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe has reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research regarding Biden's removal from the list.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that glows in the dark - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a glow-in-the-dark treat.
He came up with the idea when he read a scholarly treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically make a protein that causes lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the tongue of the consumer - it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore, the more you lick, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious,” says: “It’s an amazing substance, but when it comes to making, we’re at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream begins to glow.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because lighting up jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each scoop costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unusual flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next product will be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream."
At its core, this is impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I am counting on finding a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a skunk.
For two years, there was no candy in my apartment, and this year it will probably not be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, when it comes to Halloween, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year - 158 million of them in fact - and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to about Halloween is the trends.
According to the NRF, $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent is expected to go to costumes.
This year, the latest fashion fads are sexy inanimate objects.
Not only women can be sexy; pizza, hamburger and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will bring that to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
You will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we waste no time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million pounds of Hershey's, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets, and Clark sticks.
This is great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe me, we consume 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best titles, such as "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million, according to the American Haunted House Society, and that includes those amazing photos of you peeing in fear that your friend posts on Facebook and you can’t remove them, and the person you like will look at the photo and post a comment like “You look pretty.”
Finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Ever since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - we've been doing it since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend started last year with the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up carving the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting open a pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercommunication equipment.
There are improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racers who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable path to world-class racing.
We are happy to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the harshness and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
In two years, we have an early election.
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one, in an interview for Aktuálně.cz, he said that there is no other way out, and every government that emerged from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible glue.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the life of the beginning of the parliamentary term to be two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, he disagrees: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could lose voters in the next election as this year (compared to 2010 he lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that there will be early elections, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party leadership, said that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"Democratic party leaders like little boys go behind the head of state to allow them to coup in the party".
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen something so badly done in my life," added TOP 09 chairman.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to take over the party."
The first laws were introduced by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House, including the Farský Register of Treaties, which was discussed by House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The chairman of TOP 09 in an interview for Aktuálně.cz claims that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, ANO’s electoral leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of “steals” the ANO’s program with the idea of introducing a register of treaties.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it simply dusted off the proposal, which was already on its way to the second reading of the Chamber of Deputies.
Firefighters arrive to rescue a lost puppy stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cocker Spaniard Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was found trapped in a quarry by a man who was walking his dog.
Firefighters bathed on the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire units, who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days until he was freed from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After escaping when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for their lost dog and posted challenges on social media.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a bright-eyed doggie spotted Ruby stuck on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and drenched down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up on the rock.
Technical Rescue Team Leader Andy Clayton said: "The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He did not move his brow during the rescue - he was completely frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The sighting of the dog is incredible.
Technical Rescue Team Leader Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid when I saw the rescue."
First of all, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
Firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says he didn’t go after 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview for an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
She added: “That was a long time ago, and now he’s very nice to me.”
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's (70) representative said he categorically denies ever making proposals to Katy Perry.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing it with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for independent Scotland’s membership in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this was not reflected in the headlines.
No one mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
Given that Scotland is not currently in Schengen, an offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession to Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
I heard a journalist's duck say that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting idea in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why exchange the London hoop for the Brussels hoop, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The so-called “Project Europe” is officially dead.
Across Europe, the parties are gaining influence in opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded this year - came out of nowhere and already took nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively sweeping the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
On home soil there has always been resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a defining moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the straitjacket imposed on national economies by sticking to a common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters - and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenues and public spending, as Germany encourages.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper cause of Europe’s languid performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy promoted by Brussels - a code for supporting French and German companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the wage freezes in the world would not prevent the stomping of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering revolt, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany at bay and allow Paris to rise to Washington’s level in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the split of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc working against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in this election, as is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
It occurs to me that, in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude against the common currency will merge and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather be transformed into something more free in the sense of the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and align itself with the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed European order, provided it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and retain our economic independence.
Strangely enough, the SNP government in Scotland is the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to opposition to cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Matured Early
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is coming.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are involved.
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be terrified when her daughter begins to grow breasts and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that it wasn’t usually a sign of rapid development toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, in the last forty years there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years old compared to 12.75 years old in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will be at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "premature."
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - which can be carefully monitored by pediatricians.
Faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to the cessation of growth and stunting in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormonal treatment depend on the child's age, speed of development, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
As for the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but recognizes that "the suppression of puberty can alleviate problems with a girl's behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers."
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried that she might get pregnant or how she’ll manage her hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were hints and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environmental chemicals, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations vary.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys develop facial and pubic hair at an early age, the trend toward full bloom of early puberty is not as clear-cut as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) conference added additional complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryebsk Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you think,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Naďa Konvalinková in the role of a pub.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and she was very good at it.
Perhaps a popular Czech actress was planning to change her profession and start a business in a pub?
Naďa Konvalinková appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and made beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I got it right.
Even my boss offered to keep me busy and I could make a living making beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do to this day, with acting," said Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey here and there," she said.
Nadi’s longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I can't drink in this new life.
“I’m allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I’m trying to stick to that,” he said.
Aircraft manufacturers argue about the width of the seats, large orders are at stake
A dispute over the width of the second-class seats for long-haul flights has erupted among leading aircraft manufacturers, prompting a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show this month.
The issue is the width of the seats provided for economy class long-haul flights - not exactly the one that airlines would normally have preceded, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46cm wide economy-class seats, but US rival Boeing says airlines have a decision to make.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers were competing to sell the largest version of their twin-engined long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is laid out - especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats side by side - is the basis for the economic performance demands on the designs of the new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out over 10 in each row.
Airbus says competing versions of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats spread over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to gain a head start with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture of three people crowded into a restaurant with the headline “Would You Like It?”
“Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seats narrower than those on regional turboprops,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ sales manager.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but the seats on planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, by the turn of the century, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health, the weight of the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average seat width of a newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests extending the seat by 2.5cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the dimensions of the Airbus seats, saying it is not within the authority of aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility to do the things they believe they need to do in order to be successful,” said Kent Craver, a cabin space expert.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, more elbow room is essential, but for suppliers, this is a growing problem that can affect returns.
Behind this dispute is an aircraft order race with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to deflect the scales of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 percent more efficient on their latest twin-engined long-haul aircraft designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s performance requirements depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabs with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
“Forty-five centimetres wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the 777’s threat,” said Mary Kirby, a cabin interior expert and founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft salesmen even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a high-density layout for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for a larger cabin adjustment by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard of, but may deter the 777X sales wave.
The number of people infected with HIV has exceeded 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is growing every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and this was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who led Prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, last year from January to September there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of follow-up until the end of September this year, HIV tests confirmed 1,710 men and 353 women, with Prague being the most infected.
The number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian and 116 from Ústecký.
The least infected came from the Highlands, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88% of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected by blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV and passed on from their mother.
There’s a lot of nonsense in the movie Gravity, but it’s a beautiful sight, experts say.
A fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold out in the Czech Republic some time after the premiere.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150 thousand viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews rate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
News server Lidovky.cz asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exclude, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You can notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow does not float in a weightless state.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unreal effect and the whole behavior of the fire in a weightless state.
Suits wouldn't have been able to withstand that kind of damage, either.
The heroes in Gravity often collide with various objects and suits without much difficulty.
Criticism was not spared either.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth’s orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
In addition, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
People also argue on the forums about the "unrealistic" behavior of ropes.
It looks like it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grun (Director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can definitely say that I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science fiction film.
And with such a story, the author has the right (almost the duty) not to adhere to reality consistently.
"More than the discrepancies you mentioned, I was touched by the way the space station with the degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese) is shown three times."
“China won’t be around until the end of the decade, and it’ll probably look better than it did in the movie.”
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the laws of physics, and so the science-oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, the momentum is quite correctly preserved, in physics terms, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin shell of the atmosphere.
Irregularities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit seems to be reversed in some scenes than it really should be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators for their needs, but no fundamental and heaven-crying offense against logic or natural laws has been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of a similar focus, it can be seen that the creators have paid attention to the credibility of the events depicted.
Of the moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different slanted orbit than the ISS.
The result is a vastly different speed between them, so the rescue operation could not actually take place as depicted in the film.
Further, in the moment of separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so it is not even clear the origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New Nicotine Vaccine May Take Away the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine protected the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
More tests need to be done before human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first indications are good.
"We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found their nicotine dependence so strong to overcome all current approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-smoking antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the mice that weren’t vaccinated “sedated,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given often enough to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies, so they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
However, smokers are more likely to use it to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal lease policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its investigation on Friday to whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without having to participate in the tender after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating claims that Mr. Tripodi knew about Mr. Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for rentals to go into public tenders.
Tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in the government's rental policy.
A transcript of the calls presented at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the development of a commercial lease policy the subject of conversations during these phone calls?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military jets attack target in Syria, responsible official said
Israeli military jets hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a senior administration official told Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out an airstrike on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved on, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while Chairman Štěch was stirring up discord.
Hetman Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of this misery of the CSSD.
The rest of us showed our weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek made himself impossible by the most interviews on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the CSSD to propose a vice-president of the Senate, Gajdůšková, as the prime minister, who alone would not have an initial handicap and I think she would have performed a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the management will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could without fear form a minority government with only a blessing from the Prime Minister Babiš and without the People’s Party, but with the People’s Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability, because it would promote a proper referendum law, and that is what the chairman of Dawn Okamura has pledged to support.
In the end, President Babiš would accept the progress of the tax, because he is smart and will see that it cannot be done without it.
People would not bring problems, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not otherwise be in the government.
The same goes for YES, a valuable minister would be found here too, but when they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also well.
Let us give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Foreign workers with a visa may be subject to an ‘eligibility test’
As the government intends to expand police crackdowns, it is considering an “eligibility” test for foreign workers with a 457 visa authorization.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
"The loud statements of 'foreigners at the end of the line' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant remnant of the time unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force was to be protected - and I would not be surprised if anyone in the region recorded the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday negotiating with officials over people smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the ‘eligibility’ criteria are adopted, visa applicants can be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.’
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, businesses may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum has died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat to the Christmas Islands this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on the Christmas Islands where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin once the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase Two is complete, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which was in talks with Transport Scotland's national transport office, commissioned HS2 to determine additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the option of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
HS2 will also connect 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain."
So we are excited to work with the UK Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to benefit everyone and to complete the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers over the next year and to making joint decisions on the next steps.
Together with Bárta, the inspectors and analysts of the anti-corruption police arrested
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was reported by the news server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), its people were supposed to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its competence also extends to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police, Jan Petržílek, is among the arrested.
In the past, he worked for the Security Information Service.
However, anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej declined to comment, adding that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesperson for the inspection, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, she immediately referred to the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the prosecutor's office.
Also, it can be inferred from this non-specific reaction that the event took place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Barta’s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "also in this matter", but given that this was classified information, he could not confirm or deny Barta's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bárta’s arrest might be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
He was promoted to the position by Bárta together with former VV chairman Radek John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that broke out because of this between the former Prime Minister Petr Nečas and the VV had to be resolved even by the then President Václav Klaus.
I don’t know where that connection came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
“I don’t really know anything,” Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, but the real leader of the party was Barta.
Bárta was now running for election for the Úsvit movement, his parliamentary mandate narrowly missed - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list and, as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was not or is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who said before the election that he gave Bárta the opportunity to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the executors.
Vít Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former VV co-party member Jaroslav Škárka.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S., in order to mitigate regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in “flight” mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their practices in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had reviewed the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, has been leaning toward the change, but has announced that it will submit to the regulator's decision.
“We would welcome CASA’s analysis of the permission to use electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have [wireless on-board entertainment],” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will adhere to the current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon,” he said.
FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
But we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that can be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study the FAA’s decisions and the reasons behind them.
For U.S. air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile phone radio interference, as well as revise manuals, training material, hand luggage programs, and passenger information.
"Once the airline has confirmed its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew instructs passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under seats or in overhead storage during take-off and descent.
With rising middle class poverty, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
In a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter’s tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I gave all my money to do it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across areas in Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - is indeed such that ValueMax, where the woman is conducting her transaction, has become the third pawnbroker on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash - 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
pawnbrokers in Singapore routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring a person verification (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
As families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week just got out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from middle to low will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia’s CIMB bank.
Historically, high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people hastily stopping their personal possessions and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewels for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped at the city's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawn shops in recent months.
The growth in the pawnshop sector is so great that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also beyond Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it earned this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase household debt,” he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means to secure short-term, secured financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops, there are not only people in financial distress.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches to stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come from all possible backgrounds.
“These include wealthy individuals who need short-term borrowing because of their bold trades or investments, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's moribund health care system includes harsh terms to ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the union was taking “urgent measures” to avert a crisis caused by the island’s aging population, higher rates of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgeries at the request of the patient.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries, will help remove debt.
There is also money for free-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services, and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian healthcare system,” Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting regime and record-keeping obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level in order to receive the money of the Australian Union, and to report monthly where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee shall be established to ensure that the State supplies services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be of no use until a genuine reform is followed to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania's public health system.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance, which it first raised in talks with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe the federal aid package can deliver the state's public health from a critical condition," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, a spokesman for the federal health opposition, believes today’s announcement is just a “patch.”
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian Union that donates 300 million dollars, and pretend it's good news.
Mr Dutton urged Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package would be spent on a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denis Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional film journey and rendition of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in France in the 1860s, it tells the bleak story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to a convent by her family.
When he revolts, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a reprehensibly perverted mother superior and for another he becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even viewers will experience a torment similar to wearing a sackcloth shirt.

Syria destroys its chemical weapons production assets, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed essential chemical weapons and munitions production equipment, the committee on global chemical weapons surveillance said on Thursday, as violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country, not far from one of the locations where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before November 1,
the date set by that organisation, based in The Hague, for the destruction or disabling of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of producing poisonous gas and delivering munitions.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the city of Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons and storage plant, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
A group of activists who monitored the death toll in Syria through a network of activists said 120,296 people had died on Thursday.
Of these, 61,067 will be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side are 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon’s Hezbollah.
Among those killed are also 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting in Safira against insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observatory said Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but it did not have specific figures.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have to deal with tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW office, which works closely with the UN, said his team is now "satisfied that it has verified - and monitored the destruction - of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling".
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were “abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to two other declared sites that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission this organization has ever had,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, the OPCW’s Director of Observers.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam, are fighting each other in the civil war.
As for further developments, Rami Abdul Rahman, the head of the Observatory, said there was a strong explosion inside the air defense facilities in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the sentence handed down over the plotter of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict handed down over the last of the plotters who were brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for assembling explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, leaving 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life in prison, although it may have insisted that a man nicknamed "Demolition man" be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other plotters nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Mrs Corteen told AAP: “He should be put in front of the firing squad.”
Every day I have to live with not seeing more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was razed to the ground when a powerful charge placed in an outdoor parked van was detonated shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islamiya terror cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
To keep him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually caught in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt regret for the amount of grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“We’re going to see a lot of tears this year,” Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air Passengers Can Now Use Technological Advances on Planes (But Not Call From Their Cell Phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly anticipated new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect the changes to take place immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated cabin crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane descends to land, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented - and we will work closely with transport companies to do so - it will be a success," Glading said in a statement.
We’re tired of looking like “guardians.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and texting or downloading data will continue to be banned below 3 kilometers altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored due to concerns that they could hurt someone if they were to fly around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference with broadcast towers in the air,” Rosenker said.
A trade advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month proposed that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
Pressure has been exerted on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment, as passengers began to carry FM radios, a technical achievement of the time.
The new airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than the aircraft of previous generations, but they are also engineered, and approved by the FAA administration, to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio transmissions than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers emit only minimal broadcasts when a page is turned.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to loosen restrictions on travellers’ use of these devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the airliner with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes the interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members have stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off equipment while flying under low visibility instruments.
The travel industry group welcomed the changes and said it was a sensible approach for the travelling public, who use the technology extensively.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was brought to shore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One rat was taken to Aberdeen by helicopter last month after being previously treated by Scottish company SPCA at a rescue centre until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This rat has probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught over the North Sea by a strong wind.”
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found refuge on an oil platform.
Mr Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help."
By the time he was released, he was in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to connect businesses and define what changes British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
For this purpose, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe’s mysterious institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulations to product laws - most business owners expressed the opinion that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, and businessmen said that the cost of Brussels’ regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European business area, with 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreeing.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants the UK to seek a treaty change and a relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which have been identified by businesses of all sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for “meaningful change” that will shift influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake - achieving a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a profit of up to 16% in the referendum vote for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path to a tighter economic and fiscal union.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority and, as our survey results show, this means a renewed focus on business and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admits spying has gone too far
The U.S. has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London, according to AFP.
According to the minister, the collection of information was used to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington," according to AFP, came amid fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over the scandalous revelations about mass surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which also targeted U.S. allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as President Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly advocated the practice so far.
“The collection of information is necessary to fight terrorism and prevent assassinations, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Madrid attacks in March 2004, and the London attacks in July 2005.
“We prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed in time about the plots,” Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "has in some cases gone disproportionately far".
The affair over U.S. intelligence, which allegedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also spying on the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders have not concealed their indignation, and some have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict surveillance.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria is ushering in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia’s gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” removed.
As soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction in other countries in the direction of the flow is expected to begin at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
There is a decisive battle ahead.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamoon.
Israeli airstrikes on two locations in western Syria on Wednesday have reportedly destroyed rockets targeting Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the local army.
Its program is also to fight Israel, which does not meddle in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian Snubar Jabla missile base south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses were hit where the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria was continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force was teaching members of the Hezbollah armed section to handle the missiles.
The SA-8 is an obsolete missile that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are located on a moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small size, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with radar, but it turns off after firing the missile, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded region, and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
It claims to help protect Syria's Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now, 15,000 of his warriors are reportedly ready to help the army take back Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamun is located between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle is meant to be a retaliation for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah has helped the Syrian army retake the city of Qusayr on the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Qusayr had just left for Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, spending on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they did not really mind and with the state that was there (the theft and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not turn up for elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total, so 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
That is an overwhelming majority.
When I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all these parties were involved in the "stealing" and debt of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, the majority of voters have made it clear that they are not stealing and over-indebted to punish the culprits.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who participated in it will make the appropriate laws?
Is there any help?

The Royal Commission learned that before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord, two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) were charged
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that before charges were brought against child educator Jonathan Lord from the City of Caringbah in 2011, two staff members of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse.
But it was said before the commission that in their initial statement to the commission, the association stated that they had never addressed a child sexual abuse case in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another where a gymnast at the YMCA's Caringbah was convicted of sexual harassment of children he had in his care in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gaila Furness, the committee's adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's initial statement was also inaccurate, stating that external audits had been carried out at the YMCA, appreciating the organization as a leading advocate for children's rights.
The evidence presented by the commission indicates that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of four possible assessments in an audit by the Ministry of Education and Society in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from himself downwards had failed to accept Mr. Lord without making sure that the staff was aware of the obligation to report violations of the children's safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually molesting 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr Hare, however, rejected claims that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a child safety breach by Mr Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, privately babysitting them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often hard to talk to".
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt uneasy if they were to contact their superiors and report the acts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had clouded their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he told the New South Wales YMCA board his view that the lesson from the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organization was that the staff "did not report anything", and the board agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA's general manager of child services Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid distorting the evidence, but it was "excessively zealous" and poorly done.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, incorporation, training, and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview marking the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since he stepped down as leader in June 2007, Mr Blair has mostly avoided discussing British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador for the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response was quoted by the London newspaper Evening Standard as follows: "Yes, of course, but it's probably hard to come to that, so..."
While crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only a few months ago he took his first steps, this little boy and his pet animal, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly trotting through three rounds to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 dragging adult rivals.
At the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff, the inseparable pair were praised for their looks, behaviour and style.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by jurors for his natural ability to control a horse that far exceeds his age.
And Toffee received the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton received Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony daily ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee work great together.”
They didn't have much hope, but they eventually left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showcasing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and clapping."
He ran on the sand the entire length of the arena, and although he seemed so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and has been given the responsibility of two chickens.
Given how he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year contest soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said, "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked Fenton and Toffee up for their outstanding performance and for the way they showcased themselves at the competition circuit.
They always see how good the team work is between the pony and the one who runs it - and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the cute clothes, he really fit in there with him.
Newspapers that are too inquisitive should be investigated.
The Chinese newspaper, which has asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now carry out a "full correction".
The order to "rectify" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about the aforementioned Zoomlion company.
"The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of his journalistic license".
He also “ordered the Yangcheng group of Evening News to carry out a full overhaul of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant New Express executives and immediately change the leadership of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express regarding financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After being detained, his newspaper issued two front-page requests for his release, claiming he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to publishing false stories in return for payment.
"In this case, I've caused damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realize I've acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology in which he stated that he had failed to carry out sufficient scrutiny of his reports.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have made a confession on television.
Experts say the confessions are still being enforced on a regular basis, despite an amendment to a law this year that prohibits authorities from coercing anyone into accusing themselves.
A tunnel for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railway was found
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
U.S. authorities have described the tunnel, measuring roughly one meter by one meter, as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be smuggled in undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
The three men, who were said to have worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of a conviction, he faces prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October following a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which is challenging drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor of about 650 meters in length equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre link management.
For example, they offer joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken the next step to transform the Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, both Economia and Centrum have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," commented Kamil Čermák, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Economie and the entrusted CEO.
Čermák, who will lead the unified management, will be joined by Centrum Holdings CEO Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the store, and Zuzana Tylčerová, the advertising director of both companies, is also subordinate to him.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editorial offices is Vladimír Piskáček, in whose team is also the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pittsová was appointed to the newly established position of Marketing Director.
Věra Lhotská is now managing a separate corporate communication department.
The joint CFO is Karel Žalud, HR management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the content creation of all issued titles and, last but not least, to further significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into a contract to acquire Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or a portfolio of nearly two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly Respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CME will target the TV business.
Nearly a quarter of the people will be released.
The CME media group will be fired.
By the end of the year, he wants to lose 1,000 people.
He wants to do all the side activities and focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
Nearly a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for TV Nova, the domestic TV leader, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we can't really comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, the director of communications at Nova.
According to MF DNES, a significant layoff of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both of Nova’s new CEOs Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined after long-time CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke to analysts during a conference call on Wednesday about wanting to restrict all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of production of its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
The cooling tower burned down at night in the ČKD industrial area in Prague
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a large capacity storage tank was burning, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
"Firefighters drove out to the fire on Thursday before 11 p.m., this morning they were still putting out the fire," said Pavlína Adamcová, spokesperson for the Prague Fire Department.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the area did not exceed the allowed limits, according to measurements.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the premises in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a large-capacity storage fire, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"There is no functioning hydrant network in the area, so we use transport lines from tankers," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the firefighting was complicated by a poorly functioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire department has issued a second level fire alarm.
There are a total of four degrees, in the most serious situations a fourth is announced.
Chemists also set out to check the level of dangerous substances that could have entered the air in the event of a fire.
"However, they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygiene standards," a spokeswoman for the firefighters said.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police delivered the extradition notice today to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered an "extradition notice" to the 40-year-old Australian asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not do so, he could face arrest.
Assange has exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month, facing extradition to Sweden over allegations of sex crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the U.S., he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered the extradition notice to a 40-year-old man, asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour they were intended for him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges because he has posted 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist was fined 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found he had a cup of soda between his thighs.
At the Colchester police court, Howie pleaded guilty to the charge of driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the costs of ?90 and a surcharge of ?100 for the accused.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally quantified the tax on the return of financial assets, but is waiting for the final decision of Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% real estate transfer fee for buildings worth over 2 million pounds and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the real estate transfer fee in the housing stock in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in the 2012/13 tax year reached 708 million pounds, already exceed the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Given the increase in real estate transfer at high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is taxed little regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London, or to be reluctant to sell existing owners.”
Leading properties - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the rich strip, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record increase of 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but were overshadowed by a booming “home market” where Savills real estate agencies experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) growth, according to a survey.
Scientists Reveal How Tail Movements Are Linked to Dog Mood
Previous research has shown that joyful dogs wag their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tail mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
We've been trying to see the same thing in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs respond to the asymmetric tail-wagging of other dogs, the researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We screened dog films - whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and depict it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw an otherwise bland dog moving its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view wiggling its tail), it remained perfectly still.
But when she noticed the tail turning mostly to the left (again, from the point of view of the dog wiggling its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals felt insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and may not watch out for.
He said: "If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement to the right breeds less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience."
Researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a college animal health teacher at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides were important to dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
In another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were more likely to get acquainted with a dog robot when it waggled its tail to the left than to the right, when it was more likely to become insecure than when it was in an Italian study.”
The difference, he said, may be that dogs in these different studies didn’t interpret animals in movies or canine robots quite like dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs respond to real dogs might help.
"Although there is strong evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the gig in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
However, the illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the show.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's appearance at the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and based on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1st November.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and will unfortunately not be able to perform."
The show will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on 20 November and at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these shows remain valid.
We would like to apologize to all those who bought tickets for the inconvenience it caused them.
If you need more information, please contact customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope and are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men to eventually help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - the group thus shrinks to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of the current cardinals known as the consistory would be held before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to drop by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to raise the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain focus on Europe, Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope made his own decisions.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that the pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
We were not in this situation before - it's completely new.
Valero said that the popes have traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprise - so we don't know who he appoints."
GM recalls some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seatbacks
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. auto safety authority, General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, to fix a malfunction with the manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may have a malfunction.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that "if the car gets hit from behind, the headrest may not protect the passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury."
The withdrawn models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the vehicle in June, making it the most important U.S. automaker to market the vehicle since its restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the owners' notice due to a 16-day government malfunction that weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra vans, which were reworked for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The Desperate Cry of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice - I shared the hope for a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have thwarted the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obstructive policies cannot excuse the woes of Obama health care websites or drone strikes
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me during the bleak days of my sophomore year at medical school and restore a dash of hope in me.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s reminiscent of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming preponderance, and television coverage forced us to reflect on the historical value of the moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they had obtained.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82 percent support.
I close the book here.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days - they seem to be distant memories, sad reminders of missed opportunities.
In the years since I threw in my first ballot, there have actually been changes.
It was definitely not what I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy after the death of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that the partisan obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, the public’s ability to choose health care, and the closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after defending the Obama administration in front of many of my colleagues and friends, I have reached the absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The Republicans' obstructionism cannot explain the agreement to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or the drone strikes that are killing innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it is persecuting those who expose the government’s misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without due process, nor for curtailing public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of the report, which says that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they can’t even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that was to be expected.
Whether I should have suspected at the age of 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office clearly has no predictable course, and our public conversations will be shaped by opposition political parties and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confused and unscrupulous alternative, and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we once heard about.
Yet the return to 2008 - as Obama's support dropped below 45% this week - is making this book harder and harder.
It makes me remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week I read a chapter in a book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they needed to get back on pace and stay true to their mission.
“I want my magic back,” he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Says Prime Minister Tony Abbott Conflicts of Interest Over Parental Leave Program
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million tax assessment on coal, made the claim when he tried to brush off the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He was in a big conflict of interest when it came to paid parental leave, because if either of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the battle for the seat to be Fairfax District in the Sunshine Coast area by winning 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for the election results to be reviewed in order to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the polls are closed?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately, and have the results at 7:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, can you erase the results if someone doesn't like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policy agenda also applied to airports in the Sunshine Coast region and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
Public office is a public service.
“We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands will change your mood.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an unsolvable problem.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the setback was much more optimistic than the group that didn’t wash their hands.
The "washed hands" group also performed better than the other group in the next test.
Still, those who washed their hands performed worse on other tests than those who did not.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not experience any previous failure.
The results of the test show, according to psychologists, that physical cleanliness eliminates really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, the test subjects have to concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but on the way by public transport it is already a fifth.
Hygiene is also usually followed by work in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Pet care motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, to what extent it is necessary to wash your hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I am afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented the results of the survey skin doctor Klaudie Komárková.
RBS Suspends Two Foreign Currency Traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that a global investigation by regulators into suspected currency market machinations is becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities on investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where they are changing owners $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended as part of an expanding investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed it had received a request for information from authorities earlier this month.
“Our ongoing investigation continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event reported that RBS had handed over records of emails and instant messages sent from accounts and to the accounts of a former trader to the UK’s financial behaviour authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chairman of cash trading at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any misdemeanor.
Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the event said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma announced that it was investigating suspicious currency market manipulations in several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust office Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating claims that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the authorities.
Banks are combing through years-old instant messages and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest drivers of profit-making in investment bank closings in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by arguing that a large and highly liquid foreign currency market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say this is not necessarily true.
The high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign currency trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks, increasing the use of their own internal platforms, means that “you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader from its stock trading department this week, causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeds 1,000
Doctors in Prague have recorded more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 until the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
So far, 2,063 people have been infected.
In 396, the disease of immunodeficiency has already broken out.
198 people were killed.
The number of people infected in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year over the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected, and in 2010 180.
Last year, the number fell to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who led Prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start of follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1,710 men and 353 women.
The AIDS outbreak affected 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a stroll through the bustling centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the Bedekr would reveal.
Many people “read from the graves.”
Cemeteries wander slowly and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what faiths, what large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste is.
And they will find out from the graves how their relatives take care of their dead.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Care Bill
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama was in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or risk paying a fine - does not contradict the constitution on the basis of the government's tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining parts of the 2,700-page bill, and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which requires states to expand the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise threatens to divest all funding of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primary, the law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican candidates, including the supposed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
'Mugabe is a lame donkey' no longer in jail, court overturns law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public talk of Mugabe, 89, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at the helm since late 1987.
Under Section 33 of the Criminal Code, a $100 fine could result in up to one year in prison.
"State prosecutors should not zealously blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the ruling, the BBC reported.
A number of damaged Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an altercation with a police officer at a bar.
In May, an opposition activist publicly calling Mugabe "a lame donkey" ended up in prison.
In August, the prosecutor accused the 26-year-old of using a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later prove to be false," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law allowed a person who leaked false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law to criminalize someone for making a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to express oneself freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in March following a referendum.
Small steps away from the one-man dictatorship of the country began in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the prime minister's seat.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is only paid in the currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is under pressure from Mugabe’s ill-advised agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with farming.
Central banks to hold swap lines permanently
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need them.
This was stated by the banks in a joint statement.
“This is a very sensible step,” said Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not a surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first stalled.
Central bank agreements gave access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes as the U.S. Fed prepares to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
ECB launches third attempt to restore confidence in European banks
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish it afterwards, because there was someone sitting at the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn’t want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved and thanks to that my address and ID card number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn’t because I have a different OP number, address and that I simply can’t finish it and that I should ask for the data to be deleted and a new registration to be made.
So I did and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to the technical support that I ask for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
On that day, the technical support wrote to me that I have to complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of emails for technical support, where finally after the 4th emergency on October 25th, they wrote that they deleted personal data at my request.
So one would say that he could do the new registration and here the problems started again first, it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end they also disabled this).
So I used a different username and it popped up to me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, I was told that the personal data had actually been deleted on 25.10. and that I should send an e-mail with the error.
I did this (at about 3 pm yesterday) and I was told today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that therefore it is not possible, because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been in contact with technical support for a week and I'm still not able to do it.
And what if it were true what they claim (as it is not) could not register anyone with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional email and phone number and the world wonder, a page appeared to me that emailed me a link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to the email and phone number and just did not discard the data as they claim.
So again I told the technical support that they were just lying (either intentionally or they don’t know what they’re writing), because what they’re writing isn’t true.
I documented several screenshots that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "false" registration simply does not affect this.
To this, Tipsport wrote back a stern sentence - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can not verify your claim.
And he ended the communication.
He repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is tied to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and thus did not even take place.
So, to sum up, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims, but still lies when it claims the opposite.
Even worse, it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little in motion and from the technical support came an e-mail that the matter is being passed over for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and notification of the same error).
Music plays in the subway on the Bridge
The Prague Public Transport Company (DPP) has launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during metro operation, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Municipal Social House in Cologne not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the programme Between Us by singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Rumla accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benek Orchestra.
After the opening intro and the performance about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and throughout the city there was a power outage.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, two types of cards were produced, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also mentioned President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the clock, but he did not know anything about ice hockey at that time, how we meet in those squares and chant who does not jump is not a Czech.
That’s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we’re not going to play it here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, from this album sang for him a very suitable Sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied her on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, then all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little bit of a tear-off into the hillside of the heart, which immediately stirred up the auditorium.
"I'm glad you found the song interesting, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček said.
After the recollection of Petr Hapka, the song was performed by František Segrad, in the original by Richard Mueller, it was rewarded with a huge applause, while Hana Hegerová was reminded of the song Dad liked Lída Baarová along with Horáček's explanation about the communist ban and Baar's replacement by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, while Segrado sang a beautiful piece of Prague set by Jarda Svoboda, a Zásmuky native and a former Kolínák.
But that was the conclusion, standing ovation and addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more addition to the playlist, but the fans didn’t applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole foursome sat at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even the cover from the legendary LP and took a picture with any interested people.
Berdych with Štěpánek will be completed by Rosol and Hájek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil was nominated by Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent's field to the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the creator of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya, and Iran.
Training Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American Commandos in Libya.
Top Gun in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of the confused and big-mouthed, unsupportive actions of Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis were bombing.
Don’t be fooled by their claims that a “Syrian base” or “Supplies to Hezbollah” has been bombed.
Recently, I wrote here about the fact that while US assistance to secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical plane, Russia cheerfully continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli airstrike.
Clear message.
And note, Israel has again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although popular internet theories suggest the opposite.
The U.S. government awarded 2 members of the spacial units, probably the Delta force.
It was not known until now that they distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.
There is a known heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city, in my opinion they were members of a secret CIA commando, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated as to what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA's elsewhere located residence.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (just on one of them both members of the SEALs died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of a U.S. commando unit in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is baffled by the fact that during the attack the commando was not deployed officially and completely, and that it was simply hesitant to do anything.
The commanding officer, without orders, will apparently release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that it operates in the country not once, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently there was no official admission of such a thing, and even now there is only talk of a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US is half-heartedly trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Although it would require much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian air force for prosecuting US drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in the airspace, there is nothing you can do about it.
However, if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft chased an American drone in international space above the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of an American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew over the Phantom to visually verify its armament without being detected by the Phantom on radar, and then when he suddenly showed up and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without murmuring.
Not surprisingly, the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, the defender or midfielder Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, teeming with activity, after the intervention on him in the match in Teplice was ordered a penalty kick.
Viktoria reached in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end of these two duels she took a single point.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the Northerners who play offensive football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach is preparing us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent’s game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative invites fans to the Doosan Arena stands.
Plzeň's last matches did not go as she would like, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects.
That's the way it is in football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes you're worse.
I would not talk about the crisis.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the defender of West Bohemia said.
Victoria will once again rely on the support of fans.
“It’s Friday night and I’d like to invite our fans who are great.”
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pětová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a leap back a few years, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - to run from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Play with other children ball games, jump a drink.
Then during the series Helena and her boys embroider with a chain stitch a festive tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings to finally wash the dishes, vacuum, in winter to apply wood to the tiled stove and tasks to do until after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, the content of which did not even lie next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mom and I liked to collect so much.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a dead silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were loudly shot in an old tape recorder after my mother.
And then we rewinded the tapes on a pencil and played the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and toasted it with a siphon.
Or we could make a phone call over the table using cans tied together by a string - and while we were talking on the phone, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears in order to hear each other better, at that time the ear was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live on it in such a way that we did not miss anything.
We didn’t need any iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothing was passed down from generation to generation, and the best "add-on" to the wardrobe was a batik t-shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the aforementioned mom's tape recorder and the Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Auntie Hat Hop or Man, do not be angry, or as I have already said go "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, my parents certainly saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm up with us for a long time.
My little sister put a strudel in it, said he was so good with the tapes, so she tried to see if the strudel would sleep.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, she's still got that story, poor thing, on her dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put a strudel in the video and thought that she would play the recipe and not play it, which is why she still can’t bake it.
I remember how we all managed to communicate with each other, communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I made an appointment at my grandmother’s house on holiday with my neighbor’s granddaughter, when we would meet again next summer at my grandmother’s house - and that was it, that was it.
We met.
Do you want to meet someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when the whole village and I were running outside, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill by the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner together with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear the notorious phrase before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, the same goes for today, but you certainly don’t have lemon net soap tied to your bathroom tap.
After dinner, when my dad was "working" in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I would lie down on the floor, lean our feet against the tiled stove, open the door and look at the flame and listen to the crackling wood that was pouring from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't text each other every day through different chats, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew so much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially when I add these memories by looking at albums where black and white photos are neatly pasted with black corners.
And in case I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written the year of taking the picture.
I see that although the haircuts according to the pot did not suit us very well and we also had our cousin's pants two numbers larger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
I’d better get back to that one thing: reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait to see what the modern age will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the young teenage generation at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the apes" and I think they are missing a lot that they will not experience this "pre-monkey" time either.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents for the defunct company Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, a company it auctioned off as part of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps link search terms on the Internet to relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which is at the heart of Google’s search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes heavily with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a default price offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal partially motivated by Motorola's patent family.
“Despite the failure to obtain the patents at issue in the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it claims that Google’s patent is being infringed intentionally, as the lawsuit alleges.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November Smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put down her smile, the one she kept showing off as a defense against her would-be friendly surroundings.
She was relieved because it was a mask she had decided not to wear in public.
He was honest at home only on days when she was a grandmother and had grandchildren of Elika or Adík around her.
And, of course, her sons were on the phone.
She remembered very well the lesson of the endless courses of business skills.
Now they were finally really useful.
Not to upset those closest to her.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a masquerade costume.
November, or any other month, can't do the miracle of really smiling, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt appoints first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has taken the inaugural oath, but his triumphal day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the country’s first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black gowns in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer educated in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been targeted by governments for most of 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. in a small motorcade, hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and contrary to the presidential pomp of the Mubarak period, traffic was only briefly halted so that the column could pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
Morsi’s personal prestige, mockingly referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reserve tire,” has skyrocketed since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also all those who want to carry out a revolt against authoritarian Mubarak to the end.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie, told judges in a wood-covered chamber where he took the oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to deliver his inaugural address.
While standing at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
A military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chanting "the army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center for secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the revolution that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year was born, and solemnly promised to seize back the presidential powers taken from his office by a military council that took them from the ousted leader.
But agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, has yielded to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There are likely to be police specialists in the ghettos, they are supposed to relieve tension
In the future, there should be police specialists in the ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They would spend up to half of their errands here.
They would keep order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing the tension between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior counts on this.
In his view, improving the situation in the country would mainly help "accelerated provision of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
About 80,000 people lived there, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's been usury.
According to experts, the number of problem locations has increased by 100.
Relations between their people and others are intensifying.
Anti-Romani marches were held in several places.
People from the area also joined the extremists.
According to the Interior Ministry, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
A key condition is "consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement".
But this is not possible without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be able to prevent a whole range of illegal activities more easily," the Interior Ministry said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive surcharges of 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers to problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (currently about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine the places where a special policeman would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the project proposal, the selected police officers will first complete an internship in Slovakia.
Each year, five hundred people are trained in this field.
They will be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers who will work in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior design, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with strict rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social housing would have a higher standard, which would be comparable to normal housing.
Tenants would have to follow an integration plan drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to comply with the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of living.
A permeable housing system should operate for at least 30 years, according to the Interior Ministry, until the next generation grows "in a pro-integrationally-motivated environment".
The model of social housing is prepared by local development and labor ministries.
They will propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Coal Hill - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, it is a proof of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseníky Mountains in the recent period (from the geological point of view).
The last eruptions were still at the beginning of the Quaternary.
Viewed from a greater distance, the white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built in 1755 - 1765, is prominent on the top of the Uhlířský vrch hill.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church was not preserved.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley from four rows of lime trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The cross road on Uhlířský vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second one, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used different types of trees from the Low Autumn area.
Similarly, pedestals from rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also mentioned at each stop.
The coal hill is the remains of a young volcano.
Although radiometric measurements of age vary somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudny (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venusian volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born from an explosion.
In doing so, it ejected significant amounts of volcanic ash along with rock fragments from the bedrock, which acquired a reddish-brown color by burning.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red, and at times black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters, and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffs there are noticeable volcanic pumas up to 1 meter. Even the second eruption was ended by lava flow.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed from the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m thick layer of slag basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate between volcanic ash and lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of stratovolcanoes, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, it was threatened only by mining rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope down.
The quarries are disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
You can get to Uhlířský vrch by following the green tourist trail from Bruntál or Slezský Kočov.
Drivers can use the free car park at the beginning of the linden alley, where a short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague’s most beautiful residential areas in Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance payment.
Ivana quickly looked for a replacement home for herself and her then-older mother.
She received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older block of flats on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the extensive forest park and dam, on the other hand, impressed me," Ivana recalls the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a makeshift for about three years.
"Today we live here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change," adds the owner.
At that time, the mother and daughter moved from a one hundred and twenty-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary adjustments had to be made, for example, painting the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner knocked out the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impracticable and unnecessarily large hallway, and vice versa small bathroom.
By combining two rooms, a multifunctional living space was created.
The architects used plasterboard to delineate the zones and divide the room, which allowed the new placement of lights.
The first step she took after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step in the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor with a laminate one.
Ivana didn’t know what to do with the bathroom.
I've been taking home magazines for years, looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting implementation.
On my recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
“It was the most important step in the future,” Ivana said.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the hall was also modified.
The architect combined the space of the toilet and the bathroom and replaced the two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also wheelchair accessible.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued.
As part of the program How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without using the classical principles of optical division, for example, partitions or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
It was possible to separate the sleeping and living areas.
It was enough to turn the backs of two sofas and put a custom-made duvet cabinet between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and painting.
For the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marmoleum has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of recesses and suspended ceilings from plasterboard highlighted with color is an example of how to work with space in a panel building.
I left the colors to the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The glass paneling with the motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, we managed to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the older one works perfectly, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier as well as with quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
Then came the kitchen.
The lockers had previously been placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took their numbers and rescheduled the deployment.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface is softened by a slightly pearly surface.
Thanks to the ingenious solution, the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher fit into a small space.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the all-glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
Unique graph glass with digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is well maintained.
Ivana chose flowers of magnolias that remind her of her favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom was a small bath and sink, to the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cladding.
The large shower has a Ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the given environment, in which the functions and devices will be in harmony.
We unified the interior in material and color and tried on its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of everyday objects," adds Kamila Doudírová.
The Supreme Court ruled: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for possible crimes he may have committed before the Chamber of Deputies was dissolved in August.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the other hand, he decided that they should not be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knotig said.
With this decision, the court rejected the motion of the prosecutor Ivo Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state companies for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister, who offered them these posts, can be prosecuted further.
Vít Bárta was also detained by an anti-corruption police officer.
Bárt's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to comment on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this case, but due to the protection of classified information, I cannot comment on it any further."
According to Law, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Services (GIBS).
News server tn.cz reported that Bárta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post of Bart allegedly sought.
However, the latest information from the Law shows that the arrest of Vít Bárta has nothing to do with Petr Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, spokesperson for the Police Presidium, declined to comment on the case, saying the Prague City Council was investigating the case.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague, on Friday.
It is the prosecutor who oversees Bárta’s case, and her words therefore indirectly indicate that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the secrecy regime.
Reporter Novínek managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning in front of their residence in Prague's Klárov.
She was just loading her bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bárt’s detention.
He says he has no idea what is going on in the case.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list, and as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was not or is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomio Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the past early elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribery of MPs of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The sentence was later changed and Barta was acquitted.
Slept: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the juice, the lust and the enthusiasm
For Prospal, the family has always been the first, so he wants to fully submit to it at the age of 38.
He will either get a job overseas and extend his career, or he will definitely quit hockey.
“I want to play the role of father and husband.”
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he reports resolutely.
The New York Rangers, who failed to make it into the season, have injured two attackers, Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you join the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post saying they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere has it been said that this has really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but it is simply not the case.
Haven't you heard from the club?
This kind of communication happens daily in the NHL.
The point is to get to the point where the contract actually comes in.
When a player is injured or someone is not doing well and the manchaft is not working.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, there are similar circumstances, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is that you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten any yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting anything to work out?
“I’ve had these expectations since July 5, when the free agent market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to be a dad and a husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
On Sunday, Vašík has two hockey games, which is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking of doing this in full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games due to knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very much.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, victories and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you think you want to play in the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - apart from family - is also sports success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
This is where family life comes in.
My children, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
We would love to see this trend continue.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves is that in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
We should give them that chance.
Do you plan to stay in America forever?
We will continue to practice as we have done so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter, in Tampa, or wherever our steps take us.
It’s perfect to be always warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want this, so they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will to work, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
I can't plan that.
So you can say that this season you wait for it to turn out and then decide what to do next?
I am in a phase where I go from day to day.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th unit of the Temelín power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of CEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. for the majority shareholder.
A qualified manager should give the shareholder a recommendation, not hide behind it.
A government with only a sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The President of ANO admitted this in an interview for Law, which will come out tomorrow.

Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport over shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, reportedly Terminal 3.
Reuters, citing California media, claims that lawmen shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times reported that two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration were injured in a shootout.
How many people were injured and whether there were any victims is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an incident with a large number of injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
An unnamed U.S. government official told CNN.
The Israeli press has widely reported on the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army declined to comment on the airstrike.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The Israeli airstrike targeted rockets and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement, according to a US government source.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of the Israeli airstrike on the target on Syrian territory were Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, the batteries of the SA-3 missiles were visible, including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to a report by Israeli television, the recorded rockets have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly said it would hit any arms shipments to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups.
Is the Internet the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current trend is maintained, it will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made an 8% profit in the first half, and the second half began with a sharp growth mainly in Australian and British off-the-job travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual profit before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreational activity business has rebounded in Australia during the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the leisure area, while corporate clients spent less.
US trade recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring a third year-round profit.
Yesterday, Flight Centre’s shares were three cents higher at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September over a protest against planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by AFP with reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
It also said that the original allegations of piracy had not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after non-violent action against the oil rig in the Arctic have been transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA, it was a planned move.
Authorities initially accused environmentalists of piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week they announced that they would replace the charge with a milder riot, which could result in a lower sentence of up to seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped as promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two crimes.
The powerful Investigative Committee announced last week that it would replace allegations of piracy with charges of disorderly conduct.
But when 30 inmates stood before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, new charges have been filed against everyone," Greenpeace said in a statement.
In mid-September, three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries were detained at Gazprom’s oil platform.
The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have filed an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about prison conditions.
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would make it easier for detainees to meet families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
“In fact, they could be worse,” he said.
Willem-Alexandra, one of the detained activists, asked the Dutch king for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, she called on the monarch to talk about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Maliki has played a large part in the resurgence of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly a part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied during English literature classes from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English Literature and Language courses will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take the language graduation exam, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo radical change.
Other major changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual office, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our examination system to regain the trust of society" and that it was necessary to insist that the graduation exam be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours a year to mathematics, and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive math graduation exam - along with more emphasis on this subject in the rankings - will likely encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the cancer in ČSSD
Before the elections, the long-simmering dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the ČSSD Ostrava was fully ignited.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to the court over the undemocratic selection of candidates.
However, the actors of the case did not want to express themselves too much, so as not to harm the party even more before the elections.
Now the votes of the voters are counted.
The leadership of the ČSSD in Ostrava called on the mayor of Ostrava to leave the party on Monday evening, and he will probably also press for losing his position.
But Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is at stake in the disputes and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Diary.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
I am sure the ČSSD was expecting a much better result.
Was it hurt by the fact that before the elections there were disputes within the party in the media?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is currently.
It is a party that has its own internal problems, it is internally sick and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
This was made clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of CSSD?
I think that the ODS has been going through a decline for some time now, and unfortunately, similar things are happening in social democracy now.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, have moved to the people in the ČSSD and have influence over them.
It has to do with the fact that the Ostrava City Hall offices are visited by the police and they collect computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily about their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps also in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Haškovci and Sobotkci.
But it has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.
Haskovo's wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotko's wing.
A person is in a situation in politics where he sometimes has to make compromises.
But everyone has an inner limit, when those compromises can no longer be made, and this is also my case.
Initially, I did not want to run for the Chamber of Deputies, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to reach the regional candidate list in order to strengthen Sobotka’s wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
Hashka's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
Slávek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks about the ČSSD programme and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I didn’t hear anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I don't see how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start recalling the party chairman.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the party’s statutes.
In my opinion, Michal Hašek ended his political career with what he has now demonstrated in Prague.
How did you perceive that the ČSSD leadership did not approve you for the candidate?
Political parties are based on a competition of who will place themselves both from their members.
The competition should be based for the most part on the programmatic visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have much ability or vision also enter this competition, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not get anywhere else.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruples, breaking the party's statutes.
By their practices, they make political parties into mafias and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
So, before the election, you filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the candidate of the ČSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is consolidating its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establishing new organizations, gradually expelling inconvenient party members.
An example is the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they then preferred to annul the ruling on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party’s statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The leadership of the ČSSD in Ostrava, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is trying to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumír Palyza is interested in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything so that they can dismiss me.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they consolidate their power in the party for those votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was staged artificially so that I could be called a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
The city has purchased assets that are strategically valuable to it.
How do you feel about your time as mayor?
The district committee had already asked me and other people on Monday to consider staying in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief shouting, "Catch the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in the Ostrava social democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes even against the members of the party, the emergence of so many development issues, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
But everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it except to prevent others from getting to the places they want to go.
Are you going to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, then political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state if it cannot even manage itself.
So I don’t think that I would leave the CSSD now, because I think that the one who causes cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to push me away.
Olomouc will open a public ice rink in the historical centre
The organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spálený said that preparatory work on the ice rink began on 26 October and that the ice production unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The ice rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium occupied 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stands available.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that skaters can change clothes comfortably," said Spálený.
The streets of Olomouc are reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall at Horní náměstí to repair the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be opened on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín region will be solved again by the regional court
The regional court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the blame.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court had annulled the County’s decision and returned the case to him for further consideration.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons, saying the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the youths assaulted a seventy-year-old man in his home.
The old man died agonizingly.
According to the indictment, the men strangled, beat and kicked him all over his body, as well as a metal object, apparently with a gas gun, inflicting about three dozen blows on his head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The youths reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the regional court, the only, moreover, only indirect evidence against the defendants was the scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although the scents from the crime scene and other cases coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as factual and not scents.
In addition, certain errors were found in the handling of them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been proven beyond doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The emergency medical services did not report the death either.
After a few days, the CSIs contacted Olomouc doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the clues from the crime scene that the relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA from the defendants was found at the scene.
A young Slovak lived in Uherskohradistsko.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.
He said the man was the head of an organized group of six young men responsible for robbing a jewelry store.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopné.
The younger of the accused for the murder of the senior resides in Uherské Hradiště.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
Reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strings of Autumn
Saxophone giant and jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will make a dot next Wednesday behind the 18th annual Strings of Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform in the Great Hall of Lucerne on November 6 with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia led by Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's arrangements for the symphony orchestra will feature Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert on Strings of Autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of artists he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the direction of a new style of fusion in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past 13 years, he has performed with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
After the festival there will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Czech audience will be introduced to the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damko is said to have banned UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chair of the referees committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is forbidden by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the daily Pravo.
Otherwise, the FAC would be threatened.
Damková also refused to side with the football players of Pilsen, where she comes from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to the criticism, which has been raging after Plzeň recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although in recent months the FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for referees, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit the delegation, whatever the match," she said.
The reason, according to Damková, is the ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes the violation."
"We are very suspicious and we are looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop this, there will be tough sanctions," she said.
Other countries respect the ban.
“We were the exception,” she added.
If the publication of the information continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of judges," added Damková.
The arrest of Bárta is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is it behind the eavesdropping?
Vít Bárta, the president of public affairs, was arrested by police on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, head of the Department of Analytics and Computer Science of the Anti-Corruption Police, was also detained along with him.
The arrest is related to the wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
News server Novinky.cz confirmed the interception information to the Czech Press Office by a trusted source.
The intercepted phone calls made by Janoušek and Bém last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janoušek's influence on the steps of the town under Bém's leadership.
They were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, two years later they escaped to the ABL security agency.
It was owned by Bart.
News server Novinky.cz reported that the detained criminal Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with wiretaps at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the Act on the Protection of Classified Information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský from the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
It does not comment on the case for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are preparing intensively for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only 8 percent of the companies surveyed said they had not addressed the issues related to the two key codes in their company.
This is the result of a survey conducted by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, only now at the last minute many managers are beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long lived in uncertainty about whether revolutionary changes will happen or not.
"But now they have only a few weeks left to move to the new law without complications for their companies," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in the new codes, 26 percent said that their companies have already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of these companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, every fifth company has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet it has a specific idea how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only 8 percent of companies admit that they have not yet addressed the issue of recodification.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code for the largest number of companies surveyed is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the land register and liability for damage (ten percent).
For contracts, one of the most important novelties of the whole recodification will take place, namely the unification of the contract regulation only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will cease, as a result of which the contract law should become clearer for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relations," said attorney Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddaný.
In the context of the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important issue.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and running of the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means stricter obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is at risk of bankruptcy or falls into bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if board members and company directors do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit gained for the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to develop Cartier as a living language
My job is to keep the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, Pierre Rainero, style director at Cartier, explains in an interview for HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients every weekend
There are not many doctors in the West African countries; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year competition, you can vote for him or any of the other ten main candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again, driving to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he developed a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 residents.
And even if Cameroonians could visit doctors, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle says.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram into vans, attach to rooftops of medical supplies, and travel rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes: feasting, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle - with his broad smile and unbridled energy - is very eager to engage in local mirth.
The next day, the team begins treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each trip,” Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical assistance.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate - a document that the school demands, but which many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually done in the school building, at the town hall, or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for the next patient.
Using light from the generator, the operating room, and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
The group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said that after the hernia surgery he would be able to work again.
“This will change our family’s future,” the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second job funds about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when he’s actually asleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who is a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to be able to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who have come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice they would not get at home.
“We thoroughly washed Dr. Bwell’s hands and removed blood stains or held his tools,” O’Malley said.
You'll never experience that as a second-year medical student in America.
Students volunteers usually pay for the trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, food, transportation, and study are provided by Bwelle.
“He’s a hero,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant weight isn't a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy doing this job,” Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain - that's why I do it.

Minister Holcát has reinstated the position of Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves proper attention from the Ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, not only high professional professionalism is needed, but also a human approach and personal convictions.
"I will be happy and responsible to pursue those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skillful nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients, so that they perform their professions with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated on the occasion of her inauguration that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nurse’s job position and intends to cooperate, among others, with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I don't want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their own competences and together with other health professionals they form a well-coordinated team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks burden the nurses unnecessarily and take away their time, which they could and should devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with each other in the team and with the managements of health service providers, adjusting competences, as well as labour law issues, such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous nods, which, however, are not documented on a specific case where violations could occur due to fear of possible penalties.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the function of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and have a specific case investigated by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary School of Nursing in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been working as head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a bed nurse in the internal department, she also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, she has devoted herself to lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't get caught up in hate
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living and not writing, Václav Kahuda (1965) publishes a new novel, Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a small volume suggests a number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl - interviewed for Salon Kahudu.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn’t hate it.
To see all around us new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, young organisms affected by blind selfish striving.
I’m not even talking about us older people, faces ruined by powerless lust, hooligan souls and inversely polarized ideologues who try to sell their “product” with the expression of a small sales whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my friends, weirdos and hidden entities.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burn from life on this planet.
I like to go for walks and read books at night.
You're talking about frustration, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like the rest of us?
The breakthrough happened a long time ago, at about 10 years old.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, after that, I lived.
But there's still a surprised, quiet boy out there.
I see other lone trainers, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm participating in this huge, thousands-year-long movement of the life system on this planet -- this birthing of an elusive future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct inheritor of our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when the way of trial and error is created by the next and next generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
The self-talk, or rather the dialogue between the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
Just as periods of peace are interwoven with silently sleeping metastases of wars that may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn’t do anything, one day it would silently overwhelm me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and posed to layers that are stored in darkness "under the surface of consciousness".
Neocortex, the gray cortex, asks older evolutionary formations, going to the ancient rings of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the snakes, seeks the answer in the flight of the birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you talk about the ego metaphorically - would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to a constantly changing presence, in an unceasing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overloads.
Analogously - as if you "dropped" your PC, from the program speech emulator and translator from foreign languages, you would get entangled first in the operating environment, for example, Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended up at the dark green flashing Bios screen, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why do you care about this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In the hitherto functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a gap will appear.
Nietzsche once said, “He looked so long into the abyss that the abyss looked into him.”
Pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hopes disappear, mentally "die" and a new quality begins.
And why do I care personally?
I will answer with a parable.
Once upon a time, one fell into a pool and was drowning, days and months and years went by, he was always drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a “scuba diver.”
Perhaps a sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal’s texts helped me once.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
One about whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran on Shadows in dark alleys.
At the same time, behind all this branching of the authors and their message, it reads: "The bright sun of the other worlds of Karel Hynek Mácha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
Do you have a copy of the book that will be read to you?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with their difficult life decision.
Books are actually "lives" or rather, "worlds."
They are encoded in characters of letters, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of the language.
We can wake them up at any time by letting their sentences flow into the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the witchcraft - according to the old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, you will have a chain of author readings.
I remember you once liked to read.
Will you be happy to do it again, or will you feel differently after all these years?
I prefer to talk today.
And what did I find out?
There are intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are unobtrusive, do not draw attention to themselves, have friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
Let me give you an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec there was (and I hope still is) one curly bookseller (his name is aptly called Červenka), a cheerful friend and a good girl bull.
During one drinking session he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houština.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown a shredded, readable copy of my book.
I put down the just-read morning light in embarrassment, and cried briefly in a man’s voice.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and tearing drunkenly.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn’t stand it and jumped headfirst out of the window into the snow.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the night landscape and, driven by the happy rabies of the sensitive, the aching soul of the compatriots and the homesickness of the patriots, howled and stomped like werewolves until the morning.
Each book is different in form and content than the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of a folk healer the words of an old Russian myth: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a doggy on top of it, a gray chest.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe a long time ago we were devils in hell and we were drawing lots - what role on this earth we will play.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it out in the open again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way to dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our volition from such a depth and in such a breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we act with absolute certainty exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disturbance, and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various malfunctions, standing on the coast of the ocean of the unconscious and catching the tides of the soft wind in a leaky sheet made of a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday gave up on his often-repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Citing hundreds of thousands of announcements of denunciations from providers, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama broke his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called the “media hype” about the denunciations, Obama called on Americans who received the announcements to seek new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
“You’ll get a better offer,” he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements set by the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans straight: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the internet market has been "poor" since October.
“I’m disappointed and angry like everyone else,” she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Sebelius, irritated by the mic, said the sentence yesterday to an adviser sitting behind her at a committee meeting held yesterday after a heated exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, on whether she needed to get involved in the Obama care program.
More than three hours during the hearing, Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not purchase the program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, it is already up to them.
The announcement of the transaction should come in November, probably before the start of the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then, the desire of the company to penetrate telecommunications was not talked about.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunications specialist Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing head of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and lastly he headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The bet plays several cards at once.
She entered the auction and now admits that she wants to run a virtual phone with Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like this under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářské noviny, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
That could be Saskatchewan.
If it succeeds in bidding for LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction a specially designated spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or a newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), which will allow the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the saved money on some provider of fixed internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech) immediately gained a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big moloch that will be awaiting restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would acquire LTE networks already for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will be sharing their networks.
The auction could finally be a success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calls with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gather evidence of the prosperity of the castle community.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík has not been documented, let alone signed.
Of course, the editors took the lead.
However, the described cases do not answer the question of why some journalists are so inclined to Zemanites - whether it is a response to a direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathic helpfulness.
And if we assume general rottenness, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given an opportunity, do not seek to change the conditions on television.
It is true of those who say that in developed countries there are no attempts at political intervention in broadcasting.
However, the truth is that this does not mean that there are no complaints about the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be the tendency inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have not yet reached this stage of civilization, and this situation is not in our country.
But perhaps in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the verge of power
It is almost a rule that at key moments in the country the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state duties.
If T. Masaryk had been five years younger physically and mentally, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term and the events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably would not have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could have flown across the border, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London immediately and not fought there laboriously for its legitimacy.
And above all, the nation would not have a hangover from this surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in good shape under Munich, but during the war things started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
Being a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hách.
He was elected, saying that "Mr. President will not be in a position to make decisions".
But he had to, even if it wasn’t a big decision with a knife around his neck at the chancellery.
Until the last days in March 1939, intelligence chief František Moravec said what should be done so that the occupation, which he knew for the day exactly, did not go so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, neither believed him nor feared him.
Gottwald had his comrades executed, as Moscow had ordered.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely prevented from participating in normalization and had to be deposed, already completely senile.
That Husák was a helpless and sickly depressed old man made things easier in November 89, but that is the only advantage.
Havel was lucky not to have met him in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his achievements suggest that thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, here's the thing.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is now no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, just not to be seen.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally good (from a historical point of view) that the president is not completely in power.
But it is not a normal state.
Could we not elect once again in this country an acceptable-minded and an acceptable-healthy person as president?
Distant planets, black-and-white movies, and a bit of fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would casually pitch.
In the conception of his quartet, which will conclude this year’s Strings of Autumn festival on 6 November in the large hall of Prague’s Lucerna, everything is related to everything.
Part of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
Two generations younger colleagues are expected to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is something that the 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-Grammy-winner, a former bandmate of Miles Davis and probably the greatest jazz saxophonist alive today - does not like to explain.
He does not talk much about music, although his general view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I decided it was best to let life surprise me.
“Too many people plan everything and then are disappointed when things turn out differently,” Shorter said.
How insects from Thailand raised the sales of the Paris bar
Perhaps you sneeze over insects and do not know that you eat about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is organic, nutritious and you also have a unique experience.
Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of Le Festin Nu, was the first to include the insect menu in Paris at the beginning of October.
The bar, inspired by William Burroughs’ book Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now taste not only various larvae, locusts or water beetles, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged vans (so that the insects do not damage their wings, do not distort their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
“In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids,” Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just passing on a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of eating a pesto-decorated beetle, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to the served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics are said to taste it eventually, even though they start with the smallest bites and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been faced with a continuous decrease in the volume of orders and lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens, who after the implementation of the measure will save significant amounts for heating, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
Leverage and multiplier effects are significant from the point of view of the state’s fiscal policy, and it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the government’s resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow the continuation of the program, so that further challenges can be announced within it.

The dog gathered the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lány.
What's his medical condition?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at softening the U.S. defense stance on its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented admission said that in some cases espionage "has gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilots” in light of the incendiary revelations about NSA spying activities that emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The revelations sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, via a video link at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that happened out of inertia, because that possibility was, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, 9/11."
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that it had not been violated by anyone's rights.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was pursuing the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow up people and attack governments.
And what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers were preparing to travel to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. spying and to convince Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because they were disillusioned with the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance.
It is really important for the US national security interests that Europe stays on board with us, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, regardless of their rage over the NSA's programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some American allies, despite the agency's chief saying this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States.
Further revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended spying on the allies as necessary, saying it was a common affair on both sides.
Amid the turmoil, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to participate are to be published.
He said the program is still in progress.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help mend relationships, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize that we are not the only ones spying here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland this weekend as planned to respond to the animosity generated by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activity.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Staying in Thai Prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with perjury by a Phuket Island provincial court on June 15, when she told Thai police that a taxi driver along with two other men who were said to have detained her assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial television footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Police on the island of Phuket held talks with Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tunks, who asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously this is a difficult time, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on a 50,000 baht bond.
Reports from Australia state that she has meanwhile been spending her holidays in the Krabi holiday region in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a lawsuit that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to correct a smitten image for tourists, which may just have been behind the liberating verdict.
He joked, “A goal from a breakup?”
He got a puck in the defensive zone, and no one caught him.
Moreover, the leak changed after a quick forehand click.
Jaromír Jagr scored this way against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svoboda got in touch with the director of Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" he wrote.
They say we are very similar.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit night training to keep my speed up.
"I'm afraid that the defense minister might come forward and want to do an advertisement for jets!" he added with smileys.
New Jersey also claimed a second straight victory.
"And most importantly, you noticed - Maria Rottra's treatment works," concluded Jagr.
Place of post-election candle post-election goulash
The October election, rather than the winner, brought in a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not even make it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of their internal divisions.
Politicians served us a post-election goulash over the weekend instead of a festive candle.
Andrei Babiš’s movement, which promised voters to change the political style of government, became a jumper in the elections.
The fragmentation of the electoral result and the split in the winning party is recorded by the political (z)will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, there are still a few ways to win him back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While ČSSD’s chances of winning the prime minister’s seat are getting further away in my eyes, entrepreneur Andrej Babiš is getting closer.
The post-election development is still a mile away from the early and smooth establishment of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus for the economy.
Due to the loud resistance of ANO to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 MPs) is still the most likely option.
Given the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be rather daunting for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD composed of "non-Zemans" at the Castle will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to make another snap election?"
The next election would be more like a referendum on the strength of the ANO movement’s electoral mandate.
The ČSSD’s plans to introduce sector taxes, increase income taxes and build a state bank fell under the table.
The ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit parties, on the other hand, agree to support entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support employment of disadvantaged people, reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The spawning grounds are most prevalent in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
ANO now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition of ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean to the right.
Which, in my opinion, is a better result than the left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
