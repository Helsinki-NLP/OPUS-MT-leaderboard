Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped by goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2-1 on the Kayserispor field and kept the third Besiktas behind.
Attacker Milan Škoda after the January transfer from Slavia gave already the tenth wicket for Rizespor, which he saved, although he succumbed 1:3 on the Fenerbahce field.
Novak confirmed excellent productivity with his seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from an angle put the ball into the net.
The home team managed to equalise five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the set-up pulled the victory to their side when they successfully finished the break four on one.
At the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after a solo to 1:1.
Rizespor did not hold the tie for long, but it did not have to be sorry, because thanks to the results of the opponents remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with the Sunday duel of the master Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa field.
The well-hidden Cave at the hermit in the forests near Nový Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipský Region, in the forests through which the Count’s Road led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and artificially created.
And we'll go after the man-made one.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In reality, however, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock caution and accessible by stairs from above.
It is practically impossible to see until the last moment.
It will be revealed by a narrow staircase leading to a rock gallery, from where it is only just entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be quite far from human habitations, at the time of its formation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and even a traditional fireplace proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench at the back, which is apparently used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
Breaking sandstone with a cane was quite simple and quick for the initiates.
It was enough to make good use of the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail and the method of chopping, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is someone sleeping there at times nowadays.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you will be intrigued by the flowing stream and the nearby count's road, you will surely find the path down also.
And on the way from the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minarik is in an artificial sleep after a hard fall in Germany
“Philip is in the best of hands.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This makes the situation much easier for me, as well as taking care of my daughter, Finja,” said Minářík’s wife Katja.
"Everybody's doing their best, Philip needs time to recover.
There is no point in making predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
Now we all have to be patient and give him time," the 45-year-old jockey's wife said.
Frankie Dettori, who won his seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, equalled the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70,000 euros have been raised on the Gofundme server so far.
The target is 100,000 euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee took the footballers Sassuola four goals, they lost 0:2
The Sassuola footballers got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but in the end they had to accept the defeat 0:2.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consulting with the video because of the offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record unfavorable technology, so many hits have never been thwarted by a VAR team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no team has ever been.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Festival of unrecognized goals Sassuola.
Never before has VAR been so hard on one team," Corriere dello Sport added.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to equalize.
However, Filip Djuričič's goal was not recognized after the video referee's intervention due to offside.
For the same reason, Djuričić's next intervention and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenica Berardi did not apply.
The home team added another goal.
Electric vehicles set a new record.
In the Czech Republic they were the most successful in history.
"Growth was driven by both a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of CEZ's clean technology division.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also reporting their share on the market.
The operator of classic filling stations is represented by MOL.
She doesn’t have numbers yet.
"We only started building our electromobility network last year," said Jana Jusková, spokesperson for the company.
However, the editorial office of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by ČEZ.
According to them, drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to a range of about one hundred kilometers of a smaller electric vehicle.
If you leave out the small pumping up to 1 kWh, it takes an average of two and a half hours to charge.
The vast majority of refueling was then carried out in a free tariff.
If motorists already paid for the subscription, their typical spending was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
All five of ČEZ’s busiest chargers are located on the territory of Prague, which will overshadow entire regional cities with their popularity.
Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the other hand, the smallest interest is in remote stations in the border area, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll conducted by the Czechs on the Move daily, 8 percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s actions so far in terms of protecting and restoring the Czech landscape and solving the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more vigorous approach by the state.
The event was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have here, for example, people who have long been against the expansion at the Turów mine, there are people who are against the extraction of gravel near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who are against the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
The main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a sharp change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture, and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as soon as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not the reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostranské náměstí there was a stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring the Czech land and landscape.
Present people were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of rapeseed pits" or "Less coal, more locusts".
Jan Škoda from the association For Water for People came to Prague from South Moravia to protest against the plan to mine gravel in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that boreholes are the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned extraction of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells and, according to reviews, it is certain that the quality of water will be threatened.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč to Karlovy Vary for the so-called agroecological farmers.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms, which do not marry for income and profit and supply residents directly on the site.
"Small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, but they will not do so much damage to the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people were killed in a plane crash on a house in Germany.
Three people were killed in an ultralight plane crash on an apartment building in West Germany today, and two others were injured.
Local emergency services said two crew members and one resident were among the dead.
The plane crashed into the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters were able to control the flames.
Robert Meyboom, the deputy commander of the local fire department, said both members of the plane's crew were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, was a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), referring to the mayor of Wesel, wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police believe it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The plane took off from an airport in the nearby city of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had disintegrated in the air before impact.
On Saturday, Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice.
The error has already been corrected
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients some card payments twice.
Bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík said the problem may have involved thousands of transactions.
The bank has already corrected the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double-billing of card payments were recorded by the Savings Bank on Saturday afternoon.
“Just yesterday (Saturday) night we made an update to the system and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
Everything works without problems at the moment," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is unknown, according to his estimate, there were fewer thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated.
"It could be a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against the coronavirus on Monday
"Degrees will be according to the strength of community dissemination at the level of the regions.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told ČT.
This will be called a traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he will discuss the inclusion of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian Region would have orange color and Prague would approach it.
The map will also feature individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to solve this at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Waterman and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Karolínka fall in love, it is not easy.
Jonah is prevented from love by his father, the evil waterman Hastrbuch, and Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Fortunately, there is a young man Libor who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the water villain.
What's the point of him plotting and lying?
Especially if she can get Karolínka to reject Jonah and prefer him, the brave Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the night kettle, spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other mischief.
The angry villagers arrange a hunt for the waterman, and an implacable waterman’s curse will fall on Jonah’s head.
And now for Caroline's soul!
How to soften the old Hastrub, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the spell?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of the Czech Television and in the exteriors by the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful setting of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

Most people have moderate disease, but only 3% have to go to the hospital.
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading in the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious wards of hospitals are semi-empty, although the numbers of infected are increasing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized patients," confirms the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out samplings, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died every day.
Now daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, a maximum of two people die.
The Karvina region still has the highest number of people infected per capita, and Jihlava has similar numbers because of the outbreak in the local Alzheimer’s centre, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed by hygienists in Černožice in Hradec Králové.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
"We are struggling, we have limited movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says the director of the retirement home Martin Scháněl.
According to him, none of the clients of the house has symptoms of the disease yet.
Hygienists will begin testing the area tomorrow and then decide on further action.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will tell if people wear a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of the coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of the dusty company.
In total, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half the number on Friday - but less is tested on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished the story, Anderson was swept away
The big surprise of the tournament, named Dimitri van den Bergh, showed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian dart player.
Van den Bergh took the 13-arrow leg and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Cattle" hardly got to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dreammaker" had him in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the 11th leg, he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was frustrated.
Rather, he was throwing the darts away, and his triumphant opponent was completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Earning a trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for a Belgian darts player as it is his first major win.
The last player who managed to beat Van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes were charged over the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original stained glass windows from the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Suspects of arson were investigated by investigators due to the fire progressing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police did not find any signs of anyone entering the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer at a local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without launching a prosecution.
Prosecutors said that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
On Monday, we will present the "semiphore" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to fulfill the role of a pandemic plan, due to the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"The degrees will be according to the strength of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be attached to the individual stages, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on Prima Partie television, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been increasing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by saying that there is nothing essential to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the emergency staff.
The government has reintroduced the obligation to wear drapes at internal events of more than 100 people due to the growing number of people infected since Saturday across the Czech Republic.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1,000 people.
The government’s actions, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures would apply and when they would be announced, received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear masks also in non-residential medical facilities, for example in pharmacies or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear drapes when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí regions since Friday.
In the Vysočina region of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in internal public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved a so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of infection risk in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and medium-risk countries, since 15 June, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to take a negative coronavirus test or to quarantine them instead.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in the Benešov region continues.
He's playing for a third capacity, should have finished at noon.
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty near Hlaváčkova Lhota in the Benešov region continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the evening estimates of the police, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates were three hundred, in the morning there were 900, police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková said.
Originally, the technoparties were supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems really died down.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still going on.
We expect that the music systems will be disconnected and dismantled gradually," Nováková said.
"Police officers are still scrutinizing outgoing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or substance abuse.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of law enforcement officers, foreign police, traffic and law enforcement, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During the day, police checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of whom were behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police also investigated 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants, the technoparties conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on Prima Partie television.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor did the sanitary station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
Czech Television (ČT) said on Sunday that the technoparties had extended to surrounding land whose owners did not agree to use for technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
Fans of techno on the meadow near Hlaváčkova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
Police initially patrolled the meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region, where technoparties were held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváček’s Lhota, where the technicians actually went.
According to Novak, no one came to Blažim.
Bite of the viper: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case of this year was recorded in Železnorudsko.
The viper bit a girl in her leg, the year 2010, who was brought by her parents to the local rescue service base," Mária Svobodová, a regional spokeswoman for the emergency medical service, told Deník, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Šumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chances of a viper biting you are not very high, she is afraid of herself in normal contact.
And if she has the space to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even her bite is not a tragedy, her poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can happen only if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk of danger is especially in children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"After a bite, a person often feels sick, sweats, has increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers may experience anaphylactic shock," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital described for the Journal.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
After the policeman poured wine and threw dishes
After 11 p.m., an intervention unit entered the apartment and detained the men.
The infants were immediately taken into care by health workers, regional police spokesperson Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or poured wine out of the window.
He increased his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the window sill himself, where he wailed.
Police are still investigating the man.
No further information is yet to be published.
Stosurová prefers her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be hitting the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The 36-year-old US Open champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
“I’m going to stay home, spend time with my family, be on top of all the little milestones that our Evie is going to experience over the next six months, and just enjoy it,” she said in a statement.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on 3 August with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Raid Reveals Meat, Fish and Eggs of Unknown Origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area carried 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition, under inappropriate conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of in the sanitization plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
During the inspection of the live fish stand, it was found that the seller does not have documents on the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a long-term problem from a veterinary point of view.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians uncovered an illegal grocery store with nearly half a ton of unlabeled food without proof of origin.
For most, it was not possible to determine the date of consumption, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin on the phone with Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in Donbas, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is to start from midnight.
Putin also criticized the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening between the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The cease-fire is to begin after midnight on Monday, is to be "complete and general" and is to open the way to the fulfillment of other provisions of the peace agreements.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said that the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament ruled that local elections will not take place on territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections there.
Zelenskiy’s office said the two leaders agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of the fighting or withdrawing some troops from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional gunfights and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed more than 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet taken place.
The unexpected champion in decathlon is Rykl, seven-fighter dominated by Novotná
The defender of the last two Doležal titles did not finish the 400th round of Saturday’s programme, Kopecký did not jump the pole on Sunday.
Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, ruled the ten-fight for a long time, but resigned after the discus.
Rykl has so far had two bronze medals from the outdoor MČR, this time he was the only decathlon player to get over the seven-thousand mark.
Other medals went to Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora after the competition.
"It's a shame that there were no boys and Kope didn't start because the results would have been completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a persona 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was even more pleased with the stick and most disappointing was probably the disc, where I was below average," he acknowledged on the union's Facebook page.
The first day of the seven-fight was won by Kateřina Cachová, despite suffering from an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she wrote only 570 cm, did not switch 40 meters with a javelin and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points before Kateřina Dvořáková.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
“I really wanted it to be around 630.
Yesterday I started pulling my calf, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises eco-friendly operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given a significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol stations in a mixture with classic fossil LPG," says Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists are now refueling into their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
“The only difference from conventional LPG is the method of production,” says Ivan Indráček, the association’s chairman.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by natural gas extraction separation.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
Some of the largest producers of bio LPG currently include the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the Association’s estimates, about 170,000 vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in the Czech Republic, about 200,000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, last year alone almost 6 thousand conversions of LPG-powered cars were carried out.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the numbers of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number fell from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479, 1,775 fewer cases.
Currently, there are 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the surge in the number of cured is a revision of data that recently the hygienists have not been able to update," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had contracted the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered, and 371 had died of Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or correspondence election.
A political scientist and a sociologist were looking for variants for the time of the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), quarantined people should be able to vote in the October regional and senate elections because of the coronavirus.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated procedure.
This was reported on Sunday in the Prima TV Party.
He plans to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties in the ministry on Tuesday.
“Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law,” he said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the legal rules in force.
However, the minister said that it will be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health condition.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on the OVM programme that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for a vote abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because it would be more likely, according to experience from abroad, to upload to other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overvalued.
He is personally opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be implemented this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main one is to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers correspondence choice (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
He sees the above-mentioned electoral units or the possibility of a proxy vote within the family as another option.
He added that there is a chance to learn how similar situations - the elections at the time of the coronavirus - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, different types of elections in 67 countries have been postponed this year.
Protests in Buharsk: Pig ears thrown by protesters at government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA news agency said.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
At 8 p.m. about 300 people gathered, some streets had to be closed for traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government building played a theatrical scene, during which they symbolically locked both Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption during construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadjigenov, said on public radio that on Wednesday there will be a "peak of escalation" in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as calling early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said he will not resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to implement the covidu-19 pandemic in Bulgaria and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not reassure the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government held a vote of confidence in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Bologna football coach Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of the Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re doing right now is not football.
I'm fed up with games without spectators.
It's genderless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks so,” Mihajlovic said before the game against Lecce.
Coronavirus pauses are followed by Series A matches in quick succession, and although they are not played until the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under these conditions, you won’t even know where the teams are.
I wish this season was over.
These measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who previously led Fiorentina and AC Milan.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he was missing for four months on the bench for the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the break in the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to continue to grow and to do that we need players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become targets of foreign cyberattacks, says Iran
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire that broke out in Natanz this month may have been caused by cyber-sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure is facing "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to be repelled.
In recent months, Mousavi said, there have been a number of broader cyber-attacks, with “certain governments and groups” being behind the attacks.
However, he did not provide further details on the possible perpetrators, Reuters said.
Mousavi added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state-run IRNA agency this month discussed how enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind recent incidents.
However, none of these countries have been directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a member of the leadership of the Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired multiple missiles at US bases in Iraq.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers have been wounded.
Israel sees Iran as its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA Extends Production Shutdown to May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroen Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to restart on Monday morning, May 25.
The outbreak will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the car manufacturer.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to restore it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown are closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavirus affects key markets of the company, such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the shutdown of production in TPCA does not sign on life in the city.
"At first, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it got a lot loose.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
“In those two months, we didn’t have to solve almost any problem,” Kašpar said.
For example, Mladá Boleslav-based Škoda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants works at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
About 2,500 people work at TPCA and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in Cologne.
Cancer kills bride shortly after marriage: Leave a message to family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson had been battling insidious cancer, and when she appeared to have defeated the cancer, the disease recurred.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospice bed, where she could still take the love of her life.
Unfortunately, the disease has succumbed.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled through competitions held around the world.
A 39-year-old woman has been playing sports and living a healthy life, but was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma has begun an exhaustive treatment, radiation therapy, in the hope that she will recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have won over the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time it attacked the spine.
A bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the Daily Mirror, underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and then began drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary one last time.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema had written for her family.
“If this is published, it means I’ve finally died after weeks of fighting too much.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough who has been by my side all this time and given me a tremendous amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media, adding that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she found peace.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all of my followers on social media,” she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and memory games
For a hundred crowns, the passerby will receive a pocket work of mostly beginning Czech artists.
Images and other creations are created directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit in a size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always includes a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said the curator of the project Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer may be surprised by what kind of artwork he gets.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini views by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutková prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell a pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the trumpeter and fortune-telling cards, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritistky.
Salaries in health care will increase by a maximum of 5 percent next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic, according to Vojtěch.
Salaries in health care could rise by no more than five percent next year, Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) said in Václav Moravec’s Questions on Czech Television.
The trade unionists’ demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aids.
Hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase could be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March it intervened in the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread.
Insurance companies’ incomes fell at the time.
"I feel that a 15 percent increase is unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) is likely to reach CZK 88,312, nurses CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
ICUIS data also show that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125, according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow pay tables, and the contractual wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private.
Therefore, they also require uniform pay tables for health care workers.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, last year’s salaries were higher than last year’s salaries.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive the current state of affairs.
Due to the impact of the covid epidemic, the House recently approved an increase in this year’s state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of healthcare workers in hospitals and social services.
The council of health care providers, according to Šmucler, does not agree with the general increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
He also said that hospitals have a lot of protective equipment.
Pavel Švagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its possession.
He's waiting for the tender to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, of course, there is something to improve.
We'll discuss it with the military tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and the question is whether they should not run the whole thing again," the prime minister said on his Facebook show.
According to him, IT systems and hygiene stations cannot be sufficiently interconnected, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the Prime Minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told the Czech News Agency that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The military is prepared for this move.
The Smart Quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former minister's deputy Roman Prymula.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticised the scrubbing project on Sunday.
He also suggested that the army might take him up again.
Weaknesses in the project were previously admitted by Vladimír Dzurilla, the government commissioner for IT and digitalization.
“The system works, but we are still working on it.
Twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unite it in a few months.
It's not working.
People on the run, poor people on the run, adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
Mayor Macura won't run again because he doesn't want to "get stupid in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "not be fooled in politics," he told news server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO chair, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 local elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought that I would last one term and with that business experience I could turn everything around and put it on its feet," Respektu said.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for the second term.
“But for me it’s the maximum.
I don’t want to mess with politics,” added Macura, who described himself in an interview as a heavy introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation about Macur’s possible end in the ANO movement for some time.
Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities ANO supported in the elections of Zeman's opponent, Jiří Drahoš.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is caching me into it, I have no immediate motive to stop," Respektu said.
Sixty-five-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as the director of Walmark, a pharmaceutical company.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber returns to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of the change in the law, Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, the law has changed the conditions for operating regular and alternative taxis since July.
Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On the basis of them, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or missing a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return due to a change in the law.
Since July, it has been possible to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter.
Too hot celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a person on the sidewalk
Office chairs flew out of the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed at that moment by a pedestrian who immediately called the officers.
Immediately after arriving at the given address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which there were still chairs and next to it several cans and butts.
“The movement from the fourth-floor room indicated that there was a rather noisy celebration going on inside.
Officers went down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men between the ages of 26 and 29 for an explanation," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Request for appeal of Rafaje to be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition social democrats on Monday the motion to dismiss the head of the antitrust office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafaj.
The non-profit organizations called for Rafaje’s dismissal at the meeting of the government’s anti-corruption council as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say an exchange at the head of the office is in order.
According to ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and according to the law he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Rafaje’s recent cases.
In the past week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would become familiar with the materials and that the government parties would take a "some position" on it.
He also said he has not yet met with the president, and has not yet met with him.
According to the Office for Human Rights, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Last week, IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote that the police are interested in Rafaj’s meetings with the governor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the controversial new hospital in Zlín worth eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard for.
Cunek admitted the meeting, according to him, they were jointly dealing with his "senate activities".
Rafa says the same thing.
The council of the Ústí Region called for the dismissal of Rafaje at the end of June.
He also called for reform of the agency’s decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the Office on public procurement according to the Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened in the antitrust office over a tender for the collection of tolls.
This June, news server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses flats written on the company of the influential backstage player ČSSD Alexander Čuba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for the flat in Brno was paid from Rafaj’s account.
Rafaj has been the President of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and was appointed for a second term by the President of the former Member of the Social Democrats in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafajov’s second six-year mandate will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not been in office for more than six months or if it seriously undermines the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the library in Blansko, employees collapsed in the heat.
Helps air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months it was almost impossible to stay there.
It was very hot and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of Blansko's readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often reached over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun, thanks to the curvature of the building, rests in it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because the windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have this from the morning in the library to thirty degrees," Dlopa said.
The worst part was the reading room on the third floor.
Upstairs, there's the exhibition room and the principal's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It happened several times that librarians collapsed at work and ended up in a state of incapacity for work.
The problem also regularly occurred in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, I couldn’t breathe anymore,” he said.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to do air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of the limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
Reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children’s department are one floor higher,” said Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed air conditioning in the mentioned premises last autumn and modified the electrical installation.
Approximately 360,000 crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
The resistance of Chicago drove out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent about the health of their players and don’t publish anything at all.
He was one of the few to leave Crawford.
A 35-year-old Montréal native was only present at the first practice, since then missing in the lineup.
"I would like to announce to all of you that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last two weeks locked up in my home," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about their health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into the full load.
"It's wonderful to be back.
I will do my best to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, the fixed part of the goal is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will face St. Louis in the preliminary round.
Thousands protest against Israeli prime minister
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is dealing with the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," another said.
Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He dismisses all charges and calls them witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses being summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel.
455 people died from the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce daily increases in the number of people infected.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, the numbers of infected people began to grow significantly again at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has failed to adequately help, for example, self-employed people affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also bothered by the fact that the government issues contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters.
The tragic accident happened around 11 p.m. at Neveklovo on a narrow district leading from the Slapy dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued from the wreckage by firefighters, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy to determine whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and embarks on a fundamental change of strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, the often despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite quickly over the last few years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blindly following fast-changing fashion trends are gone.
“Most retailers already count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it is actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
Moreover, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti presents RAF aviator Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was liked by the city management," said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
It used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where they kept him for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig made his way to the United Kingdom, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, who is known in the field of street graphic art as Camo, has been working with sprays in Teplice streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the grounds that were set aside for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna Arrives on Texas Coast
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST at night for today) on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas.
It struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 25 miles (24 km) north of Port Mansfield, and weakened into a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It has brought with it strong winds and heavy rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and advised people to evacuate voluntarily.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is to hit an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous tides, and isolated tornadoes can pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a statement.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST) the storm was moving in the area of the U.S.-Mexico border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but as it progressed to the mainland, it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which again knocked Hanna out of the hurricane category.
Authorities have urged residents to stay home and not to forget the hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states in the U.S. that is most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to maintain distances, evacuations are also a big challenge.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools, and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who had tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to bring masks and disinfectant gels with them if possible.
“We’re not even close yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service in Brownsville.
Predictions suggest that up to 300 millimetres of precipitation, in some cases close to 500 millimetres, could rain in some places in the next few hours, which, together with sea level rise, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman lends general rank to Colonel Lipko
President Miloš Zeman will lend the rank of General to Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This is according to the Department of Defense’s anticipated events.
The reason for granting the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's accession to the post of deputy commander of the alliance multinational division northeast in Poland in August.
Lipka still serves as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The government proposed a promotion to Zeman at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division of the Northeast in Elbląg, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance’s forward presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltic States.
In March, Řehka became the director of the National Cyber and Information Security Bureau (NÚKIB).
The government proposed to the president that Lipka be given the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Professional Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be conferred on a soldier for the duration of an elected office or for the duration of a service assignment that requires a higher rank to be conferred.
The post of deputy commander of the alliance division corresponds to the rank of general.
A soldier to whom a rank has been conferred shall have the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment corresponding to the given rank.
The loan of the rank shall last until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It significantly participates in the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the promotion proposal.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
EU countries have agreed on common health standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the observance of distance or wearing masks in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry said the deal had been signed by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be enough fresh air in the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
A temperature record was set in the Arctic Svalbard, where they measured almost 22 degrees.
"A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees.
Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spitfires are heating up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by the Norwegian Center for Climate Studies last year.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as 10 degrees unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.
Temperature increases in Svalbard can result in the melting of ever-frozen soil, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ice sheet of the ocean.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all non-essential trips to mainland Spain due to the risk of covid-19 disease spreading.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our top priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the statement said.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we would immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries," she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
The British are concerned about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne, for example, booked a 10-day vacation to Lanzarote on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
“We were supposed to go with the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don’t know what’s going to happen.
I work as a train driver and I don’t think my employer will agree to quarantine me for two weeks after I return from vacation.”
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, more than 900 new cases have been reported every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia trying to limit all night life and prevent people from congregating on a large scale.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss the model of electricity purchase from the planned new Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant unit on Monday.
The bill envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price will be lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power is the unregulated portion of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save money thanks to the construction for electricity.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
Environmental organizations have previously criticized the plan.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havlíček said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people on the Dukovany construction site to earn money.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year for the family, which is much less than people pay annually in invoices for electricity to support the so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any draft amount, it is to be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Power Exchange for 2021, for which traders are currently the most supplied, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With a difference in the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, it could be the supplement of an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-person households, standardly equipped with electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and hot water - less than 100 CZK / year."
“We are living in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group, told ČTK.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, or by a legal entity authorised by it, owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the terms of purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but the longest until the end of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon generation design as a nuclear-reactor power plant connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously said that the new Dukovany unit should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit is expected to be operational in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state without interest during construction, with a 2% interest rate during operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, and it is also bothered by the possibility that Russian or Chinese companies would build the Dukovany.
The state should contribute 70 percent to the construction.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
In May, ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovany block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development withdrew material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The document, according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and on billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn by the Office from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) told news server SeznamZpravy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out by the Zdopravy.cz server on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan with a slump in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a decline in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from both the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the hlidacstatu.cz website, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for tourism promotion CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, press, the Internet, billboards or surfaces at railway stations.
The largest part of the money, namely 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
The majority would be acquired by private television Nova and Prima.
Newspapers and weekly newspapers would receive $400 million and the same amount would be given to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for the media campaign, most of it private stations again.
The remaining $150 million would be spent on outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at train stations or on the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented yet," Dostálová said without further details to SeznamZávby.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this showy contempt will get a blow between the eyes at the elections in the autumn," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostálová denies that it is really about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting it, it can be less or more.
It's working material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
A broth of life, a rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album called A řída is a blade of grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič’s discography he is the fifth item and, as in previous titles, the main emphasis is on Frič’s poetry, of which he is an excellent performer.
Frič, born in 1949, was naturally influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was matched by his own, personally presented experiences and also very intimate expressions of faith.
But he was far from agitating, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), the masters will forgive me.
Frič's album offers recordings of his 2006 readings, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and never-ending bitterness," writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that sinks more and more into dull consumerism and greed, it drifts further and further away from what its soul was made of: the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a longing for those who knew that the values for which they had been created were of little interest, but who also knew that they could not be renounced only because of a general lack of interest.
The poems reminded us that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how one loses it.
If he sells himself to general decay, he will resign skeptically, shut up fearfully, or remain until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
“Paroubek is not my adviser,” said Hamas.
Jiří Paroubek, the former prime minister and chairman of the ČSSD, is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamas said this today on the Prima Partie television show.
On Friday, news server SeznamZprávy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Hamáček’s advisor.
“From time to time we will write a text, he will occasionally send me some material and I will read it,” he said.
He added that this is not an official and paid collaboration.
He said the SSP does not have the resources to waste them for similar purposes.
“Sometimes I read his opinion, so there are a lot of people like that,” he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members are still "listening implicitly to the views of Václav Klaus".
This is fine, because he is an experienced politician and a former party leader, which is also the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair of it, he called a sign of this year's cucumber season.
News server SeznamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as the vice-chairman of his LEV 21 party, is heading for the fourth place in the party’s list in the Ústí region.
Hamas has said it will not comment on the composition of the list until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American barber has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger than him, at a meeting of the NCAA University Association last year.
“We had a battle the year before, he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," Nilsen said, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply upwards, and is currently in the highest pole vaults alone.
At just twenty years old, he became a world record holder, this year on February 8 in Torun he broke the bar at 6.17 meters, a week later he added a centimeter in Glasgow.
“He jumped six meters when he was 18 when he graduated from high school,” Nilsen told the World Athletics website.
“It was clear that as soon as he grew from boy to man, all his potential and talent would be multiplied tenfold.
“Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record,” he said.
Though Nilsen’s list of accomplishments is thinner than Duplantis’s, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his potential at NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February at one of them he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he made it to the American expedition to the world championship, where he finished 13th.
The next step is to try the Diamond League for the first time.
“It’s definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because that’s where you can make a name for yourself.”
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead at events like the Olympics, the World Cup or the Pan-American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and the other stickmen time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere battle for silver?
“Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don’t think it’s going to be possible anytime soon,” Nilsen said.
"The kid has been jumping for 16 years and he has a mile advantage over everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, it will want to increase it even more.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands on the disabled son's disability pension.
She's in court.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
A woman could face up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his rightfulness and appointed his mother a guardian, who was to manage his son’s money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs and deprived him of 440,000 crowns," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman had a special duty to defend the interests of the victim as a guardian.
The woman, as instructed by the court, opened an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment reads.
He couldn’t use his son’s money for his own purposes, the woman admitted.
She said she helped pay for her family expenses.
“We had problems with our income to keep the house running.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always on the things that the son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I didn’t know I was committing a crime,” she told police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say
Findings from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, including a fine blade that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spears or spearheads.
Scientists have found that the oldest of these tools date from between 33,000 and 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, has been inhabited for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely accepted theory has been that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this cloven culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
However, this model has suffered cracks in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reports 42 different sites across North America that show human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get to America by boat.
“It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture,” said Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.
So far, the demand for tickets has been met by an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also gradually falling.
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20% every week.
So, according to the sellers, the post-crisis development is fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
According to the sellers, the most sought-after destinations are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading the way.
For Letuška.cz the most sold are flights to Split, Croatia.
From other countries, Great Britain is the most popular, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it moved around CZK 6,250 in the middle of the month, year-on-year CZK 3,000 less.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices are also falling to some European destinations, such as Spain or Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they are afraid of the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to Kiwi.com, pre-flight ticket purchase time has been reduced by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, require more flexibility, take fewer risks," said Michal Šindelář, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
There are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
Compared to last year’s summer season, this is about half of the destinations.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand final.
It features 49-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the tournament’s surprise, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the leaderboard.
However, he also dealt with James Wade, and in the quarterfinals he successfully fought Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"Flying Cattle" had almost reached the semifinals when faced by Michale Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated in overtime and after the result of 18:16, he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovic 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and it is perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose that has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darts player first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they overtook Joe Cullen and in the quarterfinals after a sharp start he defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the very beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained an excellent series lead, which he then kept more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, with which he faced occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased since at least the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the first coronavirus was discovered in the Czech Republic in early March, 15,212 people have been infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
5,254 people are currently ill.
This is according to the data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times in a row.
There were 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positives on Thursday, 246 the day before, and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first day of the week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have been cured of covid-19, 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days per 100 thousand inhabitants still shows Karvina, almost 59.
This is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of people infected in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place since Saturday.
People have to wear masks at internal mass events of more than 100 people, these are cultural and sports events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current 1,000 people.
Worldwide, the number of people who have been found to be infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
Johns Hopkins University in the US is tracking the pandemic globally.
The death toll from covid-19 disease is close to 645,000, according to the source.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which already has more than 4.1 million infected people, Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, accounted for the largest share of the rapid increase in the number of cases in recent days.
The number of infected is now growing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have been reported worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.
These developments can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil and India, but the number of new cases has grown in the past week in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced by the DPRK today.
Household air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorants
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by the Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel’s environment ministry, household pollutants need to be addressed right now, with many people spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned a study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which found that domestic air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forces them to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one is concerned with the quality of "home air".
Things that normally come into contact with a person can be dangerous - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The toxic gas is also emitted by the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
Children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
But not all pollutants come from objects inside the home, and the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
Quiz about Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what prompted him to write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost a chance to advance to the top of the Spanish football league due to the coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
On Saturday, Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 in the club to 28.
Due to the team's contagion, Monday's match against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had enough points to make it to the playoffs.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruni was definitely cancelled due to the fact that there was no longer any chance to play it.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
La Coruna is against the non-playing match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to custom.

Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominika's daughter revealed
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," Gotta Dominika, the eldest daughter, told Aha!, adding that the Master couldn't name Havel, and whenever he was mentioned, Karl was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominica, the feud began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark, but if he resisted somehow, he would end his career," Gottová said.
However, he added that in the end, the Czech giants found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel couldn't have heard the word until he was 60.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter and suddenly his father’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
Indeed, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because then Mr. Havel's father regularly invited him to his home on Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík is also said to have regretted that he never received a state award from Václav Havel.
However, he did see it in 2009, even though it was already at the hands of his successor in the post of Václav Klaus (79).
The current president, Miloš Zeman (75), is to award him the Order of the White Lion to honor his memory.
