A 28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco grocery store
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the steps of a local grocery store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he can’t think of anyone who would want to hurt him, adding: “He’s finally starting to do well.”
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco police department said it was a violent death and an investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was previously a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss them very much,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrow belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had slept in dormitories at first, but that he had recently “finally started to do well.”
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in a fight.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
“Even if everything else in the world were wrong, he was an uncut diamond that lit up every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the last six years, the state-owned carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
Over the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units, and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was given by the carrier to regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, 40 percent then invested in the renewal of vehicles for long-distance transport.
At present, the average age of locomotives and units is 19 years.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of ČD’s drive vehicles would increase by ten years.
Passenger cars are slightly older on average, with an average age of 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classic trains composed of wagons and locomotives have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and global railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive decreased from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic wagons fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier mainly got rid of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier scrapped 110 of these cars.
Among the investments that ČD plans to make in the fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic express rail line.
The contract provides for the purchase of up to 30 motor units and 20 electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can not get rid of it.
We are powerless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial office of the online daily Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is a touristy walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know they're standing there black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads across the country.
Officials say the bill is a weak one, making it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First of all, you need a complicated bureaucratic circle.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Motorways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main draw from České Budějovice to Lipno there is an advertising billboard on our land by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one would mind standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone, where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers say they can't handle a billboard simply because of leaky law.
Maybe pick him up and take him away.
"We can't afford that," said Nina Ledvinová, a spokeswoman for the Directorate of Roads and Motorways, referring to the complicated bureaucratic circle that the law requires to prevent the removal of the billboard.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to be followed in detail by the online daily Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
Other countries are the same.
"We have difficulties in forcing the company to remove the signs," confirms Jiří Klása, the head of the transport department at the České Budějovice Regional Office, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klasa, it is a leaky law that binds officials.
First of all, he has to address the billboard owner in order to put the ad away.
But business leaders are often unattainable or know the trick, which Aktuálně.cz described in the past, when the issue began to be interested in more detail: just move the mobile stand with advertising by a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the trash.
This is because the office must determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is seen as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
A new law could bring about a change, which will ban billboards near motorways from September next year and restrict them even on first-class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
The authorities will not be so relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on illegal land leases and no one can afford them.
For example, a billboard tempting to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the municipality of České Budějovice is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with her for the ill-built billboards.
The company faces a fine of 300,000 in each case.
These are more advertisements that have been placed in the Class I road protection zone without permission.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Department of Transport of the České Budějovice City Hall.
Advertising, which Aktuálně.cz is interested in, is not yet among these cases, but will most likely soon be added to them.
According to RSD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will reach the table of regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can’t be contacted.
She does not take over the post office and cancelled the official seat in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases the space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has in the past denied any connection.
At the same time, this spring, when RZSD started to be interested in advertising on Lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had government officials send a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his guesthouse, where the company is allegedly newly based.
However, no one has heard from the highway authorities to this day.
A futile fight.
Such silence or opaque changes of settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually imposed fines on one company for two million crowns.
He changed his name and there was nothing to do.
The executor returned the case, the ads stood on, maybe in other places.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It’s like fighting windmills, one official admits, on condition of anonymity.
So far, no one has discussed the amendment in this regard.
At the moment, I am talking to a number of people who are concerned about the problem.
So far, they have not done any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards at the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national, but also regional and municipal politics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they need them themselves because of advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don’t believe that if something doesn’t work, we need to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
However, this year’s harvest exceeds the average for the last five to ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of rapeseed (3.9 percent) and poppy seeds (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a tenth drop from last year.
Last year’s crop was above average.
This year’s harvest exceeds the average of the last five to ten years.
This year, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy seeds will be higher.
Rapeseed growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they received 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year’s crop could be 2.5% higher than last year’s.
The expected decrease in cereal production is due to both a decrease in yield per hectare of 3.7 percent to 5.71 tons per hectare and a decrease in crop area.
Farmers have sown 3% fewer fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is expected to harvest 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it in several fields.
However, the decline will be marked by a lower hectare yield, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Roughly a fifth of the decline is expected in spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The crop is reduced by 15.2%, but also by a lower yield per hectare.
On the other hand, winter barley yields 6.3% more.
The harvest of rye will also increase.
Rape yields are estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, up from last year.
The surface area was expanded by 7.3 percent.
However, the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rapeseed crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while it is a third larger than a decade ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also been increasing.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
But compared to 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the sowing areas, this year’s poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise 2.5% against last year to 27,423 tonnes.
However, the hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police charged two men with assault with a knife and a machete, the court sent them to custody.
Police charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Despite the fact that the attacker tried to escape, they caused him a cut and cut injury, which required treatment in a hospital and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both suspects were arrested immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a motion for their detention and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Police charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him cuts and cuts, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened at noon on Tuesday at Svoboda Avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková said.
A mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal altercation, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the man tried to escape, he received cuts and cuts that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
During the skirmish, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center, and because of which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the spot, there were family disputes.
Criminals accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of attempting serious bodily harm and rioting.
The prosecutor filed a motion for their detention and the court granted it on Friday, the spokesperson added.
The machete was used in the center of Olomouc by the attackers also five years ago, it happened then only a few tens of meters away, in front of the discotheque Varna in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the company's guests, who were standing outside the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attackers with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You may be surprised to see them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the sprawling building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It should have been a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new homes and offices in the city?
And what to use the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings, which despite their location, size and often also monument protection are only empty and empty.
We have selected properties in the center using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relations between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

The Clintons made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to Clinton’s charity.
Most of the Clintons' income -- over six million dollars -- is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
Most of the Clintons’ income - over $6 million - is due to their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of 9%.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump has a similar problem, but he has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump is not paying any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after her confession was published.
Clinton has repeatedly reverted to the secrecy surrounding Trump’s earnings, among other things to cast doubt on whether her rival is really as wealthy as she claims.
Trump’s fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady, today released a report on his tax bill over the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, donated 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent in taxes last year.
Polio has re-emerged in Nigeria.
Boko Haram militants have prevented vaccinations and killed doctors.
Cases of polio have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the north-east of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination there, as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopters.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, preventing vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circulating undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, an emergency polio vaccination will begin, as two children infected with the disease have been paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in neighboring states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating undetected in the area for many years.
In the past, Boko Haram extremists have prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where polio children were detected on Thursday.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from a part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, director of the World Health Organization’s polio eradication unit, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria will begin next week.
Borno has long been home to the radical Islamic group Boko Haram.
The area was only opened to international organizations and the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new polio cases were a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated in it.
The WHO said it was possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it still spread among children.
Children under the age of five will be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases worldwide.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan, and northern Nigeria.
The pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for the strengthening of the fight against it.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who had been freed by police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of the fallen women and subsequently urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one each from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to brutal physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visit was meant to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against it, the pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will attack the jihadists' factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this is not possible.
Muslims themselves should help France in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
Others will follow, the Minister of the Interior announced.
There are more than 100 jihadist factories in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee that freedom,” Valls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and prayer houses.
At the same time, it wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad for the construction of new mosques, most of it from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also the reason why preachers get into mosques, who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate broke out on the French political scene about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All of this was precipitated by other terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the new foundation will be set up in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, halal food sellers would pay for certification.
Some of that money would then go to the Foundation.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 go there for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that the preaching is in harmony with democracy.
We will close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is campaigning against the radicals.
Others will follow, the Minister of the Interior recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of our country’s principles, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that there are about 2,500 mosques and prayer rooms in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, about 80 imams have been expelled by the authorities and several dozen more are considering doing so.
However, not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly counteract radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to star Baugé.
The Czech track cyclist has to fight for progress to the eight-finals in repair rides.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after progressing from the sprint qualification among the top eighteen lost in the first round a duel with the French great Grégory Baugé, the defender of silver from the previous games in London.
He has to fight for promotion to the eight-finals in repair drives.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders and the best Czech racer of the present time took the fourteenth best time.
He made the 200th flight in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was the fifth Baugé in qualifying, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
In the end, Kelemen was attacking an experienced Frenchman, but he watched the procedure.
The gold medal was won by Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton set the record for the third-fastest 200 in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he also easily dealt with the last one, Maximilian Levy, who was a German.
The British quartet, with Bradley Wiggins, set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4km race and advanced to the finals.
The previous record (3:51,659), which had been held by the British four years since the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: They Want Fresh Wind in the Industry
Representatives of the young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the full board to support further industry events in early September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues surrounding the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government remained "still silent" on questions, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In this light, the executive body of the JDC decided by a vote to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the ongoing program of exacerbating industry events from early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to announce six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the young doctors in the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members at pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would impose a burden on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An “Incompatible” Alliance?
It was a gesture that ended with a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to an eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the lavish hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There's been a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile and hardly radiated warmth from him, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken about his "dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, according to one of the reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their pre-crisis level, but will be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold emanating from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the downing of a Russian fighter plane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin dealt blows around himself, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The scandal was all the greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has waged a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
It was as if the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were allegations from top officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he was asking for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost stripped of power last month during a failed coup and therefore needs all of his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - in particular, the cancellation of charter flights, which annually transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number has been reduced by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take a break when flights resume.
They earn on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing animosity of lengthy talks about joining the EU and the entry of Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate what one analyst described as an “alliance of the irreconcilables”: how two countries are joining forces that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly demonstrated mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank’s executive director, the RBS brand is to be repressed into a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will lose out to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Eight years ago, it almost disappeared and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategy brands were using “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will come more to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During trips to customers and staff in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
Scotland told the BBC: “The RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand our employees work for, because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has also become a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, preparing a profile of individual brands of sponsorship of the sport.
“It’s a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (that we’re asking) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?”
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would have become a great bank for customers and introduced those brands.
But as we focus on customer needs rather than our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can remind these brands, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on horse Predilection led the 3000th winner to the finish
Dettori splatters champagne after a double win at Newmarket earned him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - Horse Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved such a result in flat racing.
Its predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion žekje Dettori, who had previously won on a Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is also here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in obstacle races - jockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-times retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led more than 4,300 winners in his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistrón that distinguishes him from other riders in the balance.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn’t only ridden on weekends and big races, he’d already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie has ridden the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
He's got a lively personality, which is good for British horse racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From fleeting finishes to fleeting jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
A plethora of big race winners, including his famous "magnificent seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month ban, but showed incredible inner strength and returned in the best shape for all doubters despite.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin sacked the head of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of the head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had “released Ivanov from his services as head of the Russian presidential office,” but that there was no reason to do so.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old was previously a diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as the head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
In his appointment to Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of draft laws and to control the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to step down from the post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Convinced of smiles?
This move has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, the two men stated that they were leaving the post of the head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is it the result of a power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once thought of as a possible president, eager to suddenly lead Russia's environmental policy, has been met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin website quotes remarks addressed to Putin in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 in an interview I asked you to entrust me with this very demanding post, even one could say a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was the president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, it was even speculated that Ivanov might succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, as a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Criminal Minds, was fired after hitting the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produced the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I am sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
According to statements from ABC and CBS, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, who is best known for his roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into them for the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would also like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man in the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels left behind by a water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope Channel, believing that someone could help him explain how about five-centimeter-long fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The 1.35 billion pound project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "platform fans", which are now almost completed around each of the bridge's three pylons.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The 1.35 billion pound project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing the impressive use by civil engineers of more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In total, more than 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, concrete for the last part of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to be picked up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of any bridge is always an important milestone.
In this amazing project, this cap represents the pinnacle of civil engineering.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower extension platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay Rescue: Three Men Are “Happy to Be Alive”
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being washed away by water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13:20 UK DST after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety, while their boat continued unguided.
“We saw their boat circling near them and we thought the worst,” said Moelfre lifeboat pilot Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, a strong wind swept him away from them before we left,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man aged 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted as he held on to the buoy.
All were taken aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the overturning occurred.
Someone was holding a protective hand over those boys.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of Tluchor's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who, according to the indictment, were to receive political news from Prime Minister Nečas and his then-head of cabinet Jana Nagyová, a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
They also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
However, according to the court, they were wrongfully compensated for a total of almost 2 million crowns.
Tluchoř is now acting as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the fruit market courthouse and resolves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful (resolves criminal law matters - ed.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague court district.
The Queen has already absolved Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová, twice.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, it wasn't Tluchoř.
However, according to the lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think impartiality cannot be interpreted as excluding a court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge then, he noted to the journal.
"I think it's crazy," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political traffic.
According to his lawyer Peter Toman, however, the possible objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagyová (today Nečasová) and other defendants in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the photo, Nečasová and her husband go to court.
He had to deal with the snarls of the snarls.
For example, the ex-spouse was supposed to judge the statements of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She and her two equally old friends flew to Syria from London’s Gatwick Airport last February.
The Home Office did not comment on her death.
Police say the young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly taken to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reported to have headed for their other former classmate from Bethnal Green Academy in London.
Last year's case sparked a huge wave of attention and also tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand dollars.
Great paid job that you don’t even need to go to college for.
That's what an IT guy's job looks like at first glance.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only the extremely high salary (in Prague you can earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to the lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to Grafton, programmers, developers, network engineers, and application specialists are among the most wanted.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, candidates do not compete for a job, but for a job, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for IT professionals.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate’s intelligence and learning ability, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a university graduate, says Petr Kubačka, Director of Monster Career CZ.
It is the most profitable in Prague.
The wages of IT workers everywhere are far above the national average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is not such a chart anymore.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
The highest earnings will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come for 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it will not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
On arrival they can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK.
There is also a struggle for graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this does not apply to IT students.
If companies drag and overpay an expert from another company, they like to reach for a graduate.
They can educate him in their own way.
They can't do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but for IT students it is necessary to have at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with average knowledge of English.
However, if a support worker speaks more foreign languages, he is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Kubačka.
In Google, it's paradise.
Only Czech workers can be jealous of Google employees.
Flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs are a matter of course for them, not only for mothers.
"The company is giving new dads four extra weeks of vacation after the baby is born," said Martina Jonek, a Google spokesperson.
Caring also includes health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn is given the green light, no matter what new things they want to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
Such a full fridge is also definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (breakfast and dinner in some locations) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so what does not eat, put in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible benefits in the Czech Republic?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it is not important that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but rather the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,” the spokesperson added.
The United Nations has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "provokes serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is particularly worrying to see how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing their support for the criminal armed militias that are brazenly organizing the hunt for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey,” he said.
“One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory in an irregular manner are automatically arrested,” Zeid said.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and jailed - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own, under international law.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, up from 21,000 last year.
Pokémon Go: The Pursuit of Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off their couches and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally shrunk to TV, later to video games and most recently to smartphones.
It is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I’m talking, of course, about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to a massive interest that led to server congestion.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “take a picture” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “catch” them.
Mania has gripped the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it from its seats and driving it out to look for Pokémon.
In the U.S., this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Apple’s smartwatch app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data about exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to get people to “find 30,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have fallen on barren ground, because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don’t look good.
The importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t list all of here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in the pursuit of Pokémon.
As it happens, of course, there are also such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
What's that?
There's been a breakthrough.
At the time, smart phone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they gave us no reason to do anything like this game.
The news is fading and interest in it begins to wane at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, more games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
Effortlessly on the beam.
All of them were silent.
Excellent at everything.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight to the title in the all-around on Thursday, surpassing the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlight.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and team member of the "final five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win the all-around, and the fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey up to this point had ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success places her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to her sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 golds. Her captivating line-ups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Bilesová and the rest of the competitors, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's all-around singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
First Biles won Tuesday as an exclamation point in the celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked ahead during her long journey to the summit, which is not entirely true.
Part of her line-up in plain language - the one that includes her typical triple flip with a double twist - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, on the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym, where Boorman trained and where she gained strength.
She hasn't lost a major-league competition since the summer of 2013 - that's a winning streak that can go on as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
The log and the straight - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She made it back to the front with 15,433 points for the beam - and finished with 15,933 points in the straights.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows, Biles’ tears came as she realized a wish she had written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but then she had bronze because of the sum of the top three sets.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of what Americans call “grandmother” was way ahead.
After her simple, she sent the crowd air kisses, overcome by a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, chatting and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report said the gunman was on the passenger's side and fired eight shots from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery was not responsible for the triple murder because the attacker did not take the wallets, nor the $2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks occurred over a four-month period, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the houses,” Howard said earlier this month for CBS’s KPHO branch.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. The police believe that it was the cause of the serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and assembled a bullet from the remains of bullets in the seat and from under the bonnet of the engine.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: ‘His condition is improving’
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first thing I thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
“It’s not true, of course you’re ready for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent learn that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people didn’t do that anymore,” Picciuto explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
However, some of the milestones are already slowly being fulfilled.
He walks around with help and rides his bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth performs the sign language with which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional toll that an uncertain future takes.
I keep asking, “What’s next?”
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I’ve never asked what the overall prognosis is because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has a heartwarming message for the mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy Rains and Floods Demand Rescue Work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and extensive flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are pouring out of their banks, threatening widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's office for national security and crisis preparedness said they were receiving requests for vehicles to ride in the water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the district of Tangipahoa asked for ten thousand bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that it could rain another 8 to 13 centimetres over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood patrol was on standby on Friday as the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are forecast to peak on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He added that flooding downstream in the Ascension district would be dangerous, with these flooded streams pouring slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded level on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking people up from torrential waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among the rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water was coming,” said Hansford.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, it is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods are “rapidly spreading” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
A WWL affiliate of CBS reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elder from Tangipahoa.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
Shelters were set up in the village of Amite and in the town of Hammond for those who had been evacuated.
“They’ll be able to come home when the water starts to fall,” he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipahoa district of Hammond due to the flood, and local residents were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
“We had the last major flooding in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s administrator.
It looks like these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said heavy rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said a couple of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in a few places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still there.”
Mahaj Brown (6) - "boy shot to death", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He got so caught up in it, his little body was shot through," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was to enter the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stable condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely a shootout between several armed men.
At the site, shell casings from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found.
It was certainly an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are reportedly examining the video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday outside a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women’s gymnastics team for this year’s Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And two: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
The number one female gymnast in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic Games champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's singles all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing a sports peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it does not look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnastics team for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastic clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, trips, jerseys, fees for competitions, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in wealthy areas of the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the countless young girls communities that Simone, Gabby and Laurie have inspired.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (primarily of black and Hispanic descent), we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
Inspiration from this team will send us thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing "girl power" and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s proposal is rejected, young doctors are ready to go on strike
Ministers hoped that after concluding a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements over the changes would be ended. But 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans in July to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in "nobody's land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend working practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA’s Young Doctors Committee, said: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current workforce crisis and thus fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under the new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with reluctance to engage the dr and often with deafening silence on the part of the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to replace the doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that following the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be disagreements over the changes.
The BMA wants higher pay for work over the weekend for the 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, urged young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “The industry action will achieve little or nothing, but it will put pressure on already overburdened teams and services, and increase concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been dealing with the board of young doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are taking the agreements reached with the BMA in May.
The drug for sixty crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of having a seizure again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is severed, a blood clot can form, blocking blood access to the heart and causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to form.
The NICE proposal, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with Ticagrelor’s preliminary recommendation, we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With the computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, which was linked to a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a disregard for widespread fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should do cordons and protect frightened voters in front of polling stations.
He recommended that voters take an identity card with them and be able to prove who they are at the election.
At present, voters only need to state their name and address.
The report also suggests putting indelible ink on people's fingers when casting a vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It asks that the press be given greater access to documents from meetings and to decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
“This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and the financial fraud that goes along with it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman had "cynically interfered" with the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said he “led his campaign in such a way that it was the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were contested or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives himself up to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern over the mail vote fraud - which is alleged to have been put under pressure by senior members of the Muslim community during it to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
“Proof has been presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There were concerns that ... state institutions were turning a blind eye to such behavior because of a ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes to prevent “voting.”
The report, which is now being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to provide proof of identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conducting systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating mail ballots and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute people who exert illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit taking photos at polling stations.
Require that only English people (with the exception of Wales) work in polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless “check box checks” in the voter registration departments of the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has the proud legacy of a cradle of parliamentary democrats, but the worrisome and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Infatuation with the bicycle doppelganger of Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of famous personalities at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 have gone crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn’t the only athlete seeking gold this year who boasts her own doppelganger among celebrities - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the celebrities who are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women’s column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
A member of the U.S. archery team, Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
Alongside Kate's double on the bike lane, many people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his images surfaced, showing him strikingly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard of his resemblance to Lee since he was a child.
“They don’t see much similarity, except maybe a beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a cool guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more: the striking resemblance between the British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin, with her large, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series, Gell, to Matthew Morrison, for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan is the "athlete's version" of the actor from the film Inception
Another long-standing comparison is that of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov not only boasts the same brown complexion and blond hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the US team, fans say that she looks like a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Fit women: soccer star Hope Sol (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eye shapes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On the Waves of Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Football star Hope Sol and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have a really incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of the movie Bravo, girls!
CBC's Olympic Games commentator apologizes for saying she "blowed up" about Chinese swimmer
Spectators of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympic Games on CBC station outraged 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance analysis by commentator Byron MacDonald. Swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200 m relay freestyle
Canada's CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "pulled like a stink" during the race and "exploded".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the women's 4x200 metres relay final, he began spouting his own opinions in freestyle.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “revival” to the CBC commentators team, said, “That little 14-year-old from China gave up, man.”
Too much excitement, she dragged herself like a stench, she exploded.
Oh, thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in a time of 1:57.79 - that is 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to finish China.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to respond online and were appalled by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the announcer on CBC say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China had 'blowed up'????"
The idiot didn't notice it was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China was described as "the little 14-year-old from China gave up, my goodness."
Byron MacDonald's criticism has come from all sides on Twitter, and many have called for his dismissal.
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary, saying, "We apologize for commenting on the performance of the swimmer who leaked the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comments.
Scott Russell apologized on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and inserted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users complaining about commentator MacDonald's comments.
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
She sincerely regrets that those words were spoken, she should not have made it to the airwaves.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those who followed us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron apologizes deeply for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live air, attempting to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
“I meant the performance of the swimmer, not the person of the swimmer as such.”
“There’s no need to say that I had no intention of disrespecting you and I’m very sorry.”
Customers in Primark outraged by woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman undressed to try on panties on the sales area in the middle of Primark, shoppers weren’t sure which direction to look in.
To make matters worse, she tried out her size, undressed her panties, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and eventually tried out four pairs of panties at a store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman had “redressed after trying on her underwear and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, brazen as a monkey."
“Everyone was just watching her take off her panties again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with three others before finally deciding she didn’t like anything, getting dressed again, and leaving.
“She didn’t seem to mind who was watching, or even thinking about the guy who might be buying the panties she was trying on.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take home the panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them. That’s disgusting.”
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected the things that she was obviously trying to get out of the sale - which is also the only right thing to do.”
“I would be terrified to bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, taking them off, and that they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark knows about the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9."
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a weapon attack with Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York City, to see how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over the bully, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and “have a clear shot path.”
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before hitting it in the face with a free elbow.
Then follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you wring the gun out of his hand, hitting his head in the face and begin to retreat, while holding the gun aimed at him.
If you are approached by an armed man from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body off the firing line, grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, give the weapon strength and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from his grip and start to retreat, still aiming at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of an ambush - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a native of Suffolk, licked a euro banknote, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a toilet on a train, and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was an interesting experiment.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his tour of Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything worse in his mouth than the aftertaste.
Ian Wright is known for testing the resilience of his intestines while traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system - from the public railings at train stations to the flushing system.
In a film about it, he says, “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a kid, and I’ve put everything I can into my mouth, from the dirt to eating worms and muddy water.”
He confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple smear, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia refused to lick it after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio shot a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the ugliest thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of refreshments, juices and new categories at Valio, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the preoccupation and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of “let’s call Ian.”
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy bowels is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I asked him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we made a lick of some of that dirty stuff.”
A 2015 Valio survey found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of Socially Needy Destroyed Municipal Building in Saltash, Cornwall Before Eviction
The family of the socially needy has left a loss of 50,000 pounds on their community house after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the housing cooperative officials were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, there was garbage everywhere on the floor, and the walls were scrawled.
The family has already moved out and is believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing issues at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house could be salvaged.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here and I don’t think people should live like that.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property will probably come to be known as a “not-so-nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who have occasionally resided in the house, and police said the terror the family was inflicting included street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, squabbling, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was listed on the lease, was given a sentence for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, smelly garbage has been found.
In the house where the drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street, and people regularly called the police here
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police around here can't be counted.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was incredible silence - we're not used to that!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor at Cornwall Housing, said the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to take responsibility for her own behaviour and for the behaviour of her family.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions must have terrified her neighbors, according to a witness.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenant's sons, who lived in the house at different times, were about 20 years old.
Polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
Workers will now have to remove piles of trash that have been dumped around the house
In 2014, she raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of the Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth after the eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crowe of Den and Cornwall Police said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behaviour," she said.
The Den and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-flying military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun in the Portuguese Aveir were scared to death
The Portuguese Air Force’s P-3C Orion flew incredibly low.
The Air Force stated that it was a training flight, and insisted that there was no threat to safety.
As the low-flying jet drifted over the crowded beach, panic gripped the terrified tourists.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane getting close to the sun on a sandy beach near Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to get up after being disturbed by the noise of jet aircraft engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flyover on social media, said: “The plane flew really low twice and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to be carried low as this was the only way to inspect the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that human safety has not been compromised.
This summer, forest fires destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing the plane.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of all funeral providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (CTIA) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the survivors of their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The CTIA imposed 41 fines in the total value of CZK 73,000.
It was announced today by its spokesperson, Jiří Frohlich.
The inspectors found fault in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified measure.
Therefore, the inspection prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7,077.
This included urn covers, candle covers and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"Given that this specific area of services is still being violated, the inspection operation will continue in the next quarter of this year," Frählich added.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, had died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee’s lawyer said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, which is the bastion of the group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to a war zone - is that it will deter people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then boarded a bus to the border with Syria.
Sultana’s family learned that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person who replaces the deceased Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later stated that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland, saying that Clinton's team would not want to "rozhout ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is president of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are "supporters" and "scoops" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, there are nude calendars for “women and men”
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing famous personalities, he is trying to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to return to portraying timeless and classic nudity where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of a woman’s body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it’s a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comments section with peppery comments under the pseudonym Not All LonelyMenInMiddleAge, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of turntable records is associated not with a millennial boom who wants to enjoy the originality of owning a physical object, but with middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought the album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan either - there’s an emotional dimension to it: older people who buy turntables are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog had been broadcast as a TV report, I would have been watched by a camera going to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesticulating widely. Then I would have stopped, stretched out my hands and said something authoritative, like, “Let’s take a look at it.”
Let's take a look.
While the charm and charm of Soho is slowly fading from its heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, ready-to-wear and office supplies - several fantastic specialty record stores still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'll stand in close proximity to the different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional state is.
Stuart (55), a Glasgow native who I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an afternoon appointment in London and is looking through the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me a photo by e-mail, I did not follow him home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records, which he could not afford when they were originally released, and buy again what he sold in his youth and did not even have the wind.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12 years old," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old record back.
According to my interviews, people mostly got rid of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their gramophone records," he says.
This could explain the boom of record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that you’ll find a pleasant community of like-minded people in a music store.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly outraged by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of gramophone records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of gramophone record covers, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling in a gap or owning something tangible can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I’m a collector myself, and I think that’s the case with a lot of people.
It’s an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” says a co-worker from a pile of gramophone records.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a turntable.
At this point in the story, he probably looked seriously concerned about going through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
The “trophy” aspect and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), noticed.
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’” she says.
The percentage is not high, but it does happen.
It's more about the product side than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teens who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are couples in their seventies, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as it used to be in stores, it’s good to see different customers instead of the latest Wild Beasts pop from the speakers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but intrusive mental trauma is hard to gauge when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks around Fopp for a few minutes and watches various gramophone records on sale.
She's one of those people who looks at shop windows rather than spending frantically.
According to her words, she does not earn much, so there is no question that she would collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the records have their charms... ," he sighs eagerly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans, watching a group of teenage girls clustering around Polaroid cameras, and then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the phonograph records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph records.
No one is looking at them - maybe just because they are for decoration and some are so high on the wall that it is impossible to reach them.
It's a "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there’s not much to complain about.
Unsurprisingly, the demographic area, where there is more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most luxurious goods like vinyl are spent.
But while according to my findings, YouGov's results seem accurate - at least in record stores, they don't take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in fact, record stores, and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, browsing through recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate.
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measuring five meters tall.
French Court Refuses to Destroy Stores in Jungle Refugee Camp
A court in France has rejected an order by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in Camp Jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to close a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea at makeshift restaurants for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites must be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose fire hazards and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court said shops and restaurants were vital and that free meals offered by state-backed associations and other groups did not provide food supplement for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 makeshift stores, but said the objections of the prefect of Calais were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants have a far greater role than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened with demolition was a cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons daily, and asylum counseling for hundreds of at-risk unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the “children’s” café.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp rose to more than 9,000 after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer - the most to date.
He thought he was dead.
The ulč resurrects itself and the volleyball Ústí.
"I was able to train normally from March," he declared at the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What happened to you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
It hurt, no one found me.
Then the clot got up.
There is a broken vein in the calf, it will always hurt, especially when the weather is working or changing.
But nothing to limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I vomited blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely finished for five more days.
I really thought I was dead, even my friends and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I've got some blood issues, that I have to be more careful when I go somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Just when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still problems with the heart.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock, I'm physically better off than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to it, the group looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who are coming.
I hope we can sit together humanely so that we can fit together.
Raise your mouth?
It had a reputation as a batter, but every season is different.
Two years ago it was 8th, now it is 2nd.
There is a new team in Ústí, only a few players remain.
It was the last in extraliga, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first laps who's going to be the loser, we hope not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and has experienced a lot, he will think of better than last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with him, I had arranged it earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I am a great friend and it was agreed that he will work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's trained for a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to heckle and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we talked a few times there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after matches, so we already know each other as friends.
We beat them 3:1, I immediately gave it to him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Zee are yet to arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so I should be able to communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out who the players were, I found them playing on the internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid's jumping, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he fits in with us.
How do you look forward to being a recording artist?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm going to be 24 and I don't have the guts to take turns.
I'd rather be in the middle of the action, I'd rather be in charge of the team than someone else.
I probably wouldn’t want to play anymore if I was going to be like a second recorder and do it all the time.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in Příbram, when Kusto failed as captain, he got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
We've been climbing ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night.
A great year was in the Old Town, after it I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
That's where Budějovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short sofa remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, with his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother cheered again in the auditorium, while Boomer’s son slept peacefully with headphones on.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming competitively and in a few hours it will all be over, he said poignantly.
In the final, Phelps was almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have mastered the same discipline in four games in a row.
For most of the race, Phelps was led by fellow American Ryan Lochte and home-grown Thiago Perreira.
While the defender of gold in the final round of 50 put on a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the sofa, a bow tie advanced to the final of the 100-meter race.
The legend could not be overshadowed even compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the signer double - after a hundred he won in Rio twice.
In the final, he left Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind by 37-hundredths, with Russian Yevgeny Rylov finishing third.
While Murphy is fifth out of 200 in last year’s World Cup, he has become the signer’s king in Rio.
Larkin was deposed from the imaginary throne, who managed the same double at last year's world championship.
He won a medal in the Olympics just now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuela second after silver from the relay.
She won the Olympic swimming gold as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
"This medal is for all those who come after me, the sport will become love for them and they will get to where I am," Manuel said.
Third was the Swedish Sarah Sjostrom, who won the 100-meter bow tie in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the 200-meter round.
Australian record holder Cate Campbell finished sixth.
The breaststroke was won by Japanese athlete Rie Kanet, who won her first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
It has no valuable metal even from the World Championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
Russia’s Yulia Yefimovova won her second silver medal in Rio, which, despite her doping past, is grappling with the hostility of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
“I’m tired of it,” said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was claimed by a special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them go to the arbitration court, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a very special day.
Less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were up against.
They had to be prepared tactically.
And then, in an unusual time, the match began on the little court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the lead of the opponents, but at 19:19 they did not manage the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and equalized, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
First of all, a number of broken services meant losing 10:15 and saying goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann lamented.
How would you rate the match?
Hermannová: After an unfortunate start, before I started, we got into the game.
At the end of the last balloon, I missed the reception I was used to before.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set we picked them up with an overview on the field, another defense and pushed on the service.
In the tie-breaker there were very bad submissions, that's where we got rid of this page.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
Too bad about the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and the third set was decided by the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about those five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you feel about playing in the little court number one?
Same as in China in the backyard.
The atmosphere and atmosphere was different.
It was one o'clock in the night, complete silence, no music, nothing.
It was different from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was strange.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t do tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Coach Nausch) prepared tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical paperwork ready, so we were pretty good on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 10:30, but not at 12.
Russian Birlov's block in the preliminary round of the playoffs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in a hug in the preliminary round of the playoffs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in a group of ten, we had already moved the regime forward.
This was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o’clock.
But I think we prepared as best we could.
We knew it was going to be like that, but it’s not typical, and it’s probably not my favorite time to play.
What do you think of the Olympic experience?
Hermannová: Since the group’s progress was our goal, it’s all right on one side, good.
We did what we said.
But now, after the game, I'm sad.
I’ll sleep on it and I’ll only remember the Olympic tournament in a positive way from tomorrow.
Big Brother is here, here comes the first surveillance SIM.
You can't escape it.
The new rules will apply to all people without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from one of the local operators while staying in Thailand.
This applies not only to tourists, but also to people with long-term visas who work or marry in Thailand, for example.
The Secretary General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell the SIM exclusively to foreigners was unveiled by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
The new measures, which will allow monitoring of their location, will be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow to solve crimes committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIM should help to detect people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
Within six months, a special SIM for foreigners should appear next to the SIM intended exclusively for Thais.
A different feature will be the tracking function, which will be permanently enabled for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
“This feature is not available for Thais because we can always easily track it,” Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave out a free SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
SIM registration is currently mandatory, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not oblige foreigners to acquire a local SIM operator when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of a given country know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM is logged in to their network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so vast that even most tourists will start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ efforts to keep an eye on the movement of foreigners in Thailand have received immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the planned system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if it is necessary to monitor a particular person.
There will be an unspecified penalty for any abuse of the system.
"If a service provider tracks a SIM's location without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While currently a specific number will only be recycled after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not logged on to the network, the number could be renewed after 15 days if it leaves Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and jacuzzi on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care for the property will be taken care of by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with swinging the floor, high energy demands and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old development is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to properly harmonize the interior.
We cooperated with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us also during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social and residential space with adequate facilities for a family of four conceived as a modern, but not cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent home control.
And, of course, the quality of execution had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior yourself?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set what we expect from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the design, for example, carpets or paintings.
I think that it was our collection of mostly Czech authors, including the works of Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, that helped the architect orient herself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.
Were there any complications in the implementation, because of which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction site at the moment when it was possible to climb our floor for the first time, and found that the views we had planned actually shaded the surrounding buildings.
At that time, we literally changed the layout overnight.
Granite was used on both the kitchen counter and the fireplace wall paneling.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example on the upholstery of dining and bar chairs Norma by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe that this is a modern airy interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not going to change, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the level of shading and settlement of terraces.
Perhaps the only reproach is to the floor, when walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for the household with a dog.
Word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, the authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout and several other modifications.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of skylights in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight in the darker areas of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications, which was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You are from France.
Where did you live before moving to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led me to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere.
I thought every Frenchman was negative.
People in France are generally negative, but things have gotten worse lately.
It’s interesting that you mention negativity.
This is how some people judge the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel this way when they come to France, because they do not perceive it as tourists so much.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of people towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was Muslim.
As if I were evil.
I did not feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I have to admit that I didn’t know anything about Prague at the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t catch any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I could do anything, dress anything, and no one would judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you unpleasantly, for example, when you have strange clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think Prague people care about that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend and I set up a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czech, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that another peculiarity of Czechs is that they keep their distance at first.
He won't let anyone near his body.
This is quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses each other on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak English.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because probably everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfews or in food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And since everyone knows how to communicate in English, I don’t have the need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you experienced any negative reactions?
Is it because you are Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, a Czech, once told me about a French football team and said something like: They are not French, they are Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim has never happened to me before.
This is despite the fact that my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, that I'd be called names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that such a thing would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists defend your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to watch the violence reports too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at George of Poděbrady Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But the way I see it, these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with the violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My co-workers are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a bit more religious than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, for example, they learned Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of a woman.
How do you feel about that?
I don't feel inferior in any way.
Quite the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It also means that you don’t wear a head covering.
Like a hijab?
This is mainly due to the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a strict Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but doesn’t wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When a person reads the Quran, he should make his own opinion about these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where headscarves are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn’t feel so good anywhere else.
I was thinking about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
The sailor Kozelska Fenclová was blown to the steps in Rio.
Friday's cruises in Rio de Janiero came out to Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure Czech participation in the final race.
Packs will be collected as Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea to use the already planned routes for the transport of shipments is the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into a trio of applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national application Transfer in May.
At the moment, there are a thousand cities recorded in it, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how big a package you can carry and how much you want for it.
Someone needs a ride that day.
When the route and delivery time match, it is paired and the two receive a mutual notification.
At that moment, the chat opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people do you think would need to register so that each package always finds its courier?
I do not know the ideal state, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed to ensure that coverage is completely optimal and each offer is paired with demand.
It already works on the main routes and it is logically easier than traveling between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
In the meantime, people are building trust and finding that no one escapes with the package.
Haven’t you had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have after two months from launch?
We currently have about 5,000 to 6,000 people making the roads.
We consider this to be a success and we believe that more will be added.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competition for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing even the same day and at a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You’ll pay $100 or less, because that’s the way it’s done.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, huge multinational carriers feed here, as well as retail chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox saying that they have to pick up the package at the branch, not earlier than the day after 7 pm.
At that time, I needed a package for six hours and I waited at home, because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not annoy anyone and will send a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
No one has ever worked in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned trips between world capitals, mainly by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
Programming took three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the Transfer application in December last year and released it in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Moon and Moon Profi from this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to do all these applications that will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been a topic lately, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Are you worried about working in an area that no one can say much about, where is the border of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the side of the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to bypass tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make an income out of it.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The shipper saves and the carrier earns, respectively, reduce the cost of the journey.
This is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like this one to converge.
There can be nice stories, people are happy to help someone and they will talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say about this application that it is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not run away?
Each user of the application together with the registration scans the ID card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to both service and man.
The couriers also collect stars based on the rating of the senders.
We also offer insurance and details.
The courier is liable for uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not assume responsibility for the content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he is not aware of it.
If the police stop him and find a submachine gun or ten kilos of hash in his suitcase, the sender is criminally liable.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered persons are, if necessary, traceable by the administrative authority, which will be the only one to be able to inspect it, even we ourselves are not able to see them, data are protected against misuse.
How much money will the courier receive after successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the whole amount he asks for.
The sender will be charged a few percent extra for arranging contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
Also, no one can accuse the courier that he did not deliver the shipment, when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass beer.
After that, there is no more restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they can transport a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier can see what is required of him.
You don’t even have to pack if you don’t want to hide the content.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend had an idea more than two years ago, and I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach, which mainly targets the passengers of the plane.
At that moment I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
It took another year of development to establish Shippansee LTD in London for greater credibility of the entire product.
This is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to catch up with the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We try to respond to customer feedback and we do not deal with the foreign market as much at the moment.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t want to rush, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were a kind of upgrade.
The transfer was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address on the other side of the world.
It works for senders the same way I do, but the difference is that as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile.
Apps for couriers who want to make a living from it, we called the Month of Profi.
So someone can make a hell of a living by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make their way to work.
Now that everyone's fooling around with those Pokémon, they can collect this just the same.
A person sees where the orders are in the city, arrives at it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports the shipment.
It’s cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the site, or create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It takes a lot out of us, but we have it normally at work, so we can feed and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other ideas and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us not the Czech market, but who should, with the forgiveness of the ball, go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will correct the second part and the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of network competition in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running also includes the ability to use a combat titan.
In addition to action arcades, the game will contain levels focused on skillful movement.
They will resemble platform games and include puzzles.
To overcome them, for example, double jumps, running on walls and rope slide are essential.
Sometimes it is also necessary to destroy enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slide platforms and close massive doors.
You will shape the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're going to be Jack Cooper's pawn, dreaming of a career as a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa crash-land on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness will not be kind to him.
In addition, Lastimosa suffers fatal blows in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with bringing the captain's titan into operation.
His dream of a career as a pilot came true sooner than expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's calls to the titan will also be significant.
Players will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, robot-depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titanium will dryly list all the injuries that Cooper is at risk of during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was provided by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company’s logo and name.
As a result, Nordic released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 games are being created for the publishing house, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger than me, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she's dated a guy like that before me.
She's crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girly, loving voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He used to come out of work regularly at half past four, so she always left at three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
I later found out they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
I don’t know why, but I always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife was mentally controlling me.
I soon found out that I was in control, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a pussy.
My neighbors told me that they knew about it.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
Everyone in the family knew something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
One day I went to his apartment to see if I needed help in the laundry room.
He went in there with me, and I told him that I had gotten anonymous, that he was seeing my wife, and that he was all in evidence.
I asked him what he would say.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, looking at the ground and not saying a word.
Then I met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn’t respond and didn’t say anything to me either.
Nobody said anything to me then.
I'm the kind of person who's never been anywhere, who has trouble meeting people, let alone finding a woman.
I didn’t even think about divorce.
I was always hoping that one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never come to terms with all of this.
I still have it in me to this day.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end I gave up for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more like my wife than my housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - she cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's a hard worker.
I always wanted to have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks that we have a happy marriage.
She told me once that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, he is her god.
And I'm tired of living like this.
Even when it started and I was having a hard time, I told her once that I didn’t want to live, and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, and the government is calling on the local Muslim minority to help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual teachers in France will preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where money often comes from preachers indoctrinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But soon she was hit by internal contradictions, and therefore it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chevnement, who is known as a proponent of a secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer rooms in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering the move for several dozen more.
This week, German police also intervened against jihadist clerics.
The imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, a debate erupted in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All of this was precipitated by other terrorist attacks carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks: securing funding for mosques from domestic sources and also overseeing imams.
However, it is not yet clear where the funding will come from, although several proposals are under consideration.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. primarily meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food sellers for granting permits.
Part of the money would then go to the Foundation’s budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them leave France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have undergone educational programs at French universities should work in French mosques.
In this way, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"Since December, we have closed 20 of them and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
An unidentified gunman injured his ex-wife Friday morning at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, Spain.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the shopping mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The incident occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our appetites and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens smells grilled neck, brisket, pork knuckles.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, yet sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, the barbecue is economical on time and dishes, moreover, it is a social affair and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make a good delicacy, which special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or stew for a long time.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-acquired griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is no time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened in the water for a moment and then it depends only on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of many dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the raw materials are usually already commonly available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy and at the same time delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of appropriate size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America also as an "aid" for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packaged in them similarly to aluminum foil.
The banana leaf will then give the dish a specific flavor.
You can buy them in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only leaves of deep green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, will probably know the nori algae in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is made by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame's dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido is also eaten fresh and dried and is just as popular as the nori algae.
By the way, who does not know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women have been using it since ancient times for recovery after childbirth.
And in general, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to infuse in the water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and boil for half a minute.
Then they are cooled in ice water, cut out the middle ribs and further treated, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready-made, frozen is the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to unwrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
It's like a longevity bomb.
If you resist and do not throw an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh dish that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, we prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, boil the asparagus shoots briefly in hot water, after about three minutes, put them quickly to cool in ice water so that they do not lose color.
Put the vegetable filling on the paper and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and cucumbers, which are cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Place the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the rolls and finish the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add a couple of pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-point rugby, Fiji's choice takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in seven-point rugby ended with a devastating stop at the last hurdle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday evening at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians demonstrated a masterful lesson in processing, landfill, evasiveness, supporting play, line running, and brute force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unrivalled consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third on that day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic sevens rugby tournament, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The win over South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals on the same day, is perhaps frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would also be able to beat the 15-man team in full health.
It’s probably not a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: the Fijian’s head coach is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the penetrations of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a row of buses on the move and the World Cup champions led 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which there was a conversion.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, he threw Jaso Veremalu a touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added more after the return and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravou then penetrated the languid Britons and rushed to the line where he scored.
Conversion to 29:0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to pass.
That's the way it is.
The British made massive changes after halftime and stopped the onslaught of Fijians... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until Josua Tuisov's brilliant interlude went on.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an an 36:7. The match was already won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands, and their fans in the galleries sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the totally joyous attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the victory of the Fijians with another attempt.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn.
Earlier that same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semi-finals, and the United Kingdom defeated South Africa in the close semi-finals - by the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans in the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
A great late dump by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's 15th team, secured the victory - and finally the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing race inspired coach fight against cancer
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhalations into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
There were three voices in the boat, even though there were two in the cheers. When the boat swung to the surface to meet the second Olympic gold in a row in the women's doubles race, the voice of the still-present coach Robin Williams was with them in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their predominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent female athletes flying on the water surface with swan elegance - does not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
Behind every gold medal in rowing, there's a battalion of helping hands that make a difference piece by piece, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he'd live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I had this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of things.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The happiness for the whole trio was that they could start treatment in early 2014, out of season, and reduce the downtime to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together quickly.
That was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the win, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to manage his own agitation.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has been on a mission in Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been down with emotions this week, maybe it’s a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
It once again underscores how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked together, and Robin did too.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anyone, so thanks to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have asked for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused as much as possible at the moment.
Helen shouted, “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve something fantastic.
We weren’t looking forward to today’s fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to decide what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her future is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it,” she said.

Jail?
Instead, let them drive people for free, says Rubes, a taxi-mafia hunter, to a groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former clerk of the Prague City Hall are, according to the Czech News Agency, the defendants.
You have made a series of reports in which you have exposed the fraudulent practices of even those who are to be in the group that will stand trial.
You've faced some nasty fights with the exposed actors because of it.
How much is the news of the indictment of the members of the organized group groundbreaking for you?
I was hoping there would be a trial.
I'm curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by bringing all the people in for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not see the punishment as sufficiently effective?
It is enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they no longer do the job.
For example, one makes a ping-pong, another delivers a pizza, and one completely gives up on it.
In theory, defendants can get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an appropriate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
To put someone in jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the society they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have been doing this by destroying our country’s name and stealing people’s names.
So let's make a good business card and get people out for free.
I can't imagine any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get probation eventually and they're not gonna care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently at the Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, and is now preparing the Prague Guide program, which is primarily intended for foreign viewers.
Rubeš advises in the form of short reports which services in Prague he prefers to avoid and which, on the contrary, he recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed a series titled How to do it, City of Frauds?, Life in Luxury, Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the indictment, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
It's more about mafias - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
They are just guarding each other (taxi stations).
Prague is completely divided.
I noticed that, for example, the main railway station does not like Pařížská, Pařížská does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone just keeps their place and each group is somehow organized.
It's probably a tangled network.
However, only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former city hall official who warned the driver about the checks are indicted.
As you say yourself, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague taxi fraudsters do you estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst people on the street are still out there.
I am talking, for example, about Aleksander Ryaček.
This is a person who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred for three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
Only a few people from the entire group were selected.
The same situation exists in other locations of Prague.
By impeaching seven people, it is difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague villain, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's no use at all.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or Pařížská Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and violate ordinances every day.
It ignores both the municipal police and the Prague City Hall.
It's not even cats anymore, but sheer indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, even though they are part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like I need to get a little better, I will continue to do so.
It is necessary to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief remains, we should still do something to eliminate him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that’s not the case, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it’s still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was the amount of CZK 56 (he used a trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt for it, the police arrived and this taxi driver was so cutely cheeky that he still went to the police officers and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taximeter overlaid the decimal point and robbed tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your shots the faces of those who charged unreasonable amounts for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How did it go with the taxi driver claiming 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying they could not discuss the matter with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And I think that will be a problem in this court (six taxi drivers and one clerk).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the municipality is not allowed to use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming the parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage for reporting.
Are you concerned that this might protect you from prosecution?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometer, because he would not make a living from it.
You talked about a trick with a decimal point, which is being pushed by underwater taxi drivers especially in front of foreign clients.
Is this still relevant, or are they worried about using this trick after publishing your reports?
I think we popularized this trick by airing the show.
I recently went with a taxi driver, bragging in front of me that he is the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that black cardboard was glued to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what he had there, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If the fines did not work well for taxi drivers, can they be warned by the court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You said you thought they'd always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are the fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague, fortunately, prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they lack sense.
They don’t know how to walk and can’t say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to a proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they weren’t protesting against Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as the service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it turned out to be only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you assess the approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overpricing fares?
It is obvious that the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The Magistrate was short on that.
They had a mole that was leaking information, which means that the taxi department was doing its job for several years completely useless.
I hope they charge this official until the last check all the failed checks to make him aware of what he did.
That's the worst part of it.
I was even with him on one of the control rides, which I found out later from their schedule.
It’s been a few months since the last series was published.
What's the response?
I think mainly about foreign viewers, which is what the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them these videos.
And then when we walk around the Old Town Square, there are surprises that the same people who can be seen in the pictures really stand there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a fence around them so people would look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Right.
I travel with services where I do not have to pay cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also a lot of controls that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since then.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Well, you've got some guts."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
It was reported in 2005 that taxi drivers were being scammed.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bém set out for a check-up in the guise of an Italian tourist and immediately on the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
The editor had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for a ride from the Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which amounts to approximately CZK 195 per kilometer, as calculated by the creators of the reports.
The Prague City Hall set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometer.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed reportage: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Pařížská Street to Truhlářská Street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge also provided expensive rides.
For a ride to Anděl, which has 2.5 kilometers, they charge even six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry, and the longer the better.
Impurities from it go well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be plucked out of the folds.
It is not easy and it does not go fast, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Hájích approached her work.
Hats down in front of it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb and climb again countless times.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and undemanding to the work environment," she said.
This is not her first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, as well as the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant’s Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or the atlants in the front of the S podměrek spa in New Town.
The restoration of the gravestones of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina of Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the deposit of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; they will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
There is also treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb are gilded again.
"Then it will begin with the gilding of inscriptions on marble slabs with pure gold," said Věra Sobotová, an official of the State Monuments Care Authority in Frýdlant.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
At a closer look, they capture the holes, drilled in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of a tombstone decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
They literally brushed the tombstone, Saturday noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, restorers with a slight exaggeration are at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the gravestones that were under water, the baptismal font was restored, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to venture into stained glass in the future," said Sobotová.
The church is in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work on the restoration of the redern tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128,000.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the reconstruction.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from winning the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, said Frýdlant Mayor Dan Ramzer.
The decision to release the prize for the restoration of the tombstone was made by the council.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored by indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) within one and a half months.
There is low volatility and growth in the markets.
Who would have thought so at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high and has gained 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never, in the long run, go against the interest of central banks, which in the end have always achieved their goal.
At a time when US stocks are at an all-time high, volatility is once again at its lowest level since 2014, when markets were growing happily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the US central bank, and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below 12 percent.
And I don't want to.
While the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is underway, and last week the Bank of England, which will be buying 70 billion pounds of bonds over the next six months, has also been instrumental.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing, and Brexit is practically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to remain in a similarly calm regime.
It's a shame Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said the head of the European Commission Juncker, when he appointed the French politician (really experienced, because he was so well-versed in so many different supranational political functions that it would be difficult to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the main negotiator of the European Commission on the conditions of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU.
Juncker’s selection has given signs of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media accepted Barnier's name as an act of war by Juncker.
Barnier is a staunch European federalist.
They hate the UK.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He conceived it as he alone could: the obstinate enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and of the model of capitalism.
The proponent of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union and, with a grudge against everything that comes from the City’s London financial centre, he pushed through legislation exorbitantly harsh regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and probably also ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how can we not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the prudence, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much?
That is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this respect.
It would be for the good of everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of the head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by the Russian media with reference to the announcement of the press service of the Kremlin.
Putin said he was releasing Ivanov at his own request.
At the meeting, which was broadcast by the Rossiya 24 television station, the president said that he was willing to meet Ivanov's wishes when he took office, that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for no more than four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov will be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the exchange at the head of the president's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current representative Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63, has been described as one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
For example, this former KGB officer has previously held the posts of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of the President's Security Council.
However, Ivanov said in a meeting with Putin that the length of his stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a record holder.
He stayed there for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already taken turns in this position.
Neither Kvitova nor deblisty Uncle and Šafářova will play the final.
So far, none of Friday’s tennis matches have been turned into finals.
The first to lose was Petra Kvitova, who succumbed to Monica Puig's Puerto Rican surprise after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while Kvitova was followed by Czech deblisters Šafářívá and Stýcová.
Although the Williams sisters' slayers won in the first set, they lost two sets and the Russians eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
The second set then lost by a ratio of 4:6.
Half-success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skifarer Ondřej Synek won his semifinals with an overview, defeating the second Damir Martin from Croatia despite slowing down in the end by almost a second.
The weather was great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, he said.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for it.
So it took away some of their strength, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it will be easy, it just plays into my hands, said the rower of Prague’s Dukla.
Mirka Topinkova-Knapkova, however, did not follow in Snyk’s footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took fourth place in today’s semi-final and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
That's not how London's gold defends itself.
I didn’t make it to the Olympics for the first time.
I’m a little bit sorry, but on the other hand I did a good race and I gave it everything I could.
The opponents were simply better, Topinková Knapková bowed in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would make it to her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the goal.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could advance out of that field.
I was surprised to see a Chinese woman with such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the finals with an Austrian.
“Unfortunately, today was the race of a lifetime,” said the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who even for the second time did not manage to make it out of the qualification, this time a small shot in a lie.
He did not take 33rd place.
Qualifying was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamenskij advanced from the first place with 629 points, Kirill Grigorjan (628.9) from the second.
Nepějchal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time in Rio, including Czech seven-fighters Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová ranks eleventh after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
It is led by Britishwoman Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both of them have taken care of the historically best height performance in the seven-fight.
They tried to jump another 4 feet, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Aside from the absurdity of this question: German society has undergone a deep self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
In both great Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism cited in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experimentation.
The Nazis inhumanely exterminated about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany and in the USSR only a few individuals were not to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or just by cowardice or by sticking its head in the sand.
It’s not just these people, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came the denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This brought real reflection and healing to the society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of its citizens.
Now they also have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they are definitely not interested in joining Alsace-Lorraine or someone - on revanch - to attack militarily - perhaps everyone will recognize that.
After the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB officer (sic)Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin’s Russia is revanch, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity, and future of our own people is of no value to us.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only through decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from rising tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea has worsened.
Who benefits from increased tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side became the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides are contradictory and it is difficult to independently verify them, so we only have the opportunity to think about the old well-known question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia came from the case of Savchenko known to have been kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
Escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year there has been a decline in attention to the situation in Ukraine against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit to its residents, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt long ago if it had not been for generous financial injections by the EU and the IMF in particular.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime once again needs to draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is to be hoped that all those who try to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both opposing sides and stop their hostilities in time.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in trips of the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
U.S. intelligence agencies have been tracking Russian hackers for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was investigating an attack on the servers of the party's Democratic headquarters.
There is no official report of Russia’s involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The report of monitoring the alleged Russian attack was top secret, as its disclosure would reveal that US intelligence agencies are monitoring the hacking attack and could reveal how they are doing so and what resources they are using.
There were two Russian intelligence agencies involved in the attack.
New Advisory Board on Cyber Security
The footage of the Russian trail was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the Gang of Eight in the U.S., was informed.
It consists of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congressional Armed and Security Committees.
Democratic Party President Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is forming a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for the Democratic Party's servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's suggestion for health problems after eating food Salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygienists carried out an inspection in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a consumption date of 22.11.2016, to which the customer drew attention, was no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the consumption date of 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and man-ingested live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We apologize to our customers for any problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, for precautionary reasons, we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier with whom we are dealing, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, said spokeswoman Alberta Barbora Vanko.
If the customer has purchased this product, they can return it at any of the chain’s stores and get their money back.
Larvae destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vrňata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administration about the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the server bezpečnostpotravin.cz, after ingesting the parasite, people may become ill with anisakiosis, which manifests itself in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may occur without symptoms, the Czech News Agency reported.
Symptoms appear one to two weeks after eating insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both high and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Currently, veterinarians have also checked salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples tested had a parasite in them.
The shipment of 1,700 products arrived in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April, according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS).
Shipped, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
At the moment, unsold stocks of the product are being withdrawn from stores, Petr Pejchal, a spokesman for SVS, told ČTK on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited sending additional products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman tried to flee Raqqa after being killed by a Russian airstrike.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, a sobriety came.
The awaited paradise of the caliphate has turned into a hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She repeatedly phoned him and told him she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without thinking, the Telegraph quotes the family lawyer of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last clues led to Raqqa, from there the girl answered for the last time.
Then came the news of her death, but it cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There, they hoped to meet the former student again.
However, Kadiza was likely killed before she could flee because the house she stayed in had been raided in May, Britain's ITV News reported.
TV said the bomb appeared to have been dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would bring in blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week she was thinking about escaping from Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to risk it, Akunjee said.
My family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set off on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
But they headed for Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to ISIS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in their power to get Kadiz back.
You'd bring the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, and this family did everything they could, exerting every effort to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things were there, understood how far it differed from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also remained silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the county centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held at the town hall, and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were deplorable, and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the premises of the prison to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, it had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, because smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison was opened to the public a century later, and visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
The guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly for a photo in memory, or to evoke the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland’s most famous haunts.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already been set up there, and to this day the museum allows people to come to hunt some ghosts.
However, such a night will cost 300 pounds, which is approximately 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, the surrounding panoramas and history.
‘Animous’ Snapchat Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity every day.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that seems to emerge from the image of Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any errors will be posted immediately.
Snapchat’s filters have been criticized in the past for promoting blackface or promoting white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that allowed them to have slanted eyes, crooked teeth, and bloated faces, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated controversial questions did not point to a larger problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat said the very next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of accounts to anime characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
Others have rejected the comparison to the anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that "it's hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is tightened to a contemptible extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that has transcended these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from boardrooms in corporations to Hollywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older partners - may mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that’s offensive to some users,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, “it’s very hard to go unnoticed these days, as it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes the racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended the article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity among employees and people of color when these things are being decided,” said Zhu, who has a Chinese-American background, “or people of color work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk.”
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees, stating that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial background of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on an underrepresented population and on internal inclusion management.
Zhu added: “I’m curious to see if they really need more users like this who can say it’s not okay,” adding that her account will remain closed.
Army officers misrepresented intelligence about IS, parliamentary committee says
The parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that officers from the United States Central Command were altering intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than those provided by events from the country.
According to a preliminary report by a working group compiled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Subcommittee, "extensive dissatisfaction" was found among central intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors altered their assessment of the U.S. effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the Army's central headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The report’s press release said: “Intelligence intelligence outlets approved by senior Centcom officers typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than has been confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when a flawed analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom’s leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the continuing problems of the central staff in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that top Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report says analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the central staff’s press releases, statements, and congressional testimony were significantly more positive than what actually happened,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack to take Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“This is clear after months of investigation,” Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican Party representative from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. intelligence officials manipulated the intelligence output of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans set up a task force after learning of analysts' concerns about intelligence information relating to the Islamic State being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, must be followed by further investigation.
There is another investigation under way in Centcom’s intelligence services, led by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information about IS and Iraqi security forces,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
In the words of Adam Schiff, the process “led to a distortion of intelligence output,” damaged morale among analysts, and “lacked consideration for dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to “the blueprint or the political situation.”
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-Lieutenant Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report, as the inspector general's investigation was still ongoing.
“Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these crucial national security issues.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now being made by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s allegations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can count on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of the Islamic State coverage has reflected conflicts for more than a decade when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the George W. Bush administration - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities reported that Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's financial resources, as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been passed on outside the central staff.
The commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism last year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony too positive of the war's assessments.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 victory against Japan, and just one day after that, she scored the first two goals of the game for the U.S. women's field hockey team, in which America defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure if she'd ever done anything like that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But here's what they know: The Americans lead the Olympic Games 4-0 and share first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide who of the group of six teams will finish first and who will finish second.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group a little longer.
No matter how Saturday’s game ends, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise ride, four years after they finished among 12 teams at the games in London.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a field hockey stick for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became its youngest ever player.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team did very well.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was named coach and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London we didn’t have the pace we have today.
We made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bamová started in the first half by scoring a bekendem close by.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then scrunched through to the center and scored the ball into the goal to get the American women into the lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last wicket in the half of the fourth quarter.
American goaltender Jackie Briggs, who helped to score one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
“We’re in a good place now,” Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rampage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a hot relay pin that is passed from the archer to the swimmer, gymnast and triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in the homes in the prime time between the commercial and the sponsors' spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic flame doesn't shine the same for all competitions.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting with air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably reign for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw your attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first featured at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport has gone almost unnoticed - many people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It can be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia, and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be awarded to Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
Jumping on a trampoline is another bad luck, partly because the ear of an uninitiated person will seem more suitable for a clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential - comic vibrations of endless reflection - but also the gracefulness of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline” which means “jumpboard.”
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to almost 10 meters in height and perform sets with several elements (salts, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by performance, difficulty and "time in the air".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Gold medalists must go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He is trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but also with another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a bit fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it’s also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline brings relief in this regard.
The track of an athlete on a trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then up again effortlessly.
Without competition and, of course, even difficulty, but for the duration of the assembly there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no distance measurement, but only a perfect, graceful elasticity of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and Zen will ever get.
Women's qualifiers and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and men's competitions on Saturday at the same time.
NBC's finale will air as part of the afternoon block, which begins on both days at 2pm.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that, despite other fights, you will probably miss.
And if the only way to get attention is for male athletes to be the object of loving looks and materialization - as U.S. gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to gasp.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political changes in Ethiopia have met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been gripped by anti-government riots that are spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
The video footage of the protests, which probably came from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, shows security forces beating young people with sticks after they were forced to stand at a wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been difficult to hold this country together and make a step forward even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few, if any, African countries are getting such help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train running in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without ceasing to talk about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been banished, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
However, this may change.
“When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break,” said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
A whole generation is protesting.
There are many complaints about everything from land disputes to absolute control over the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the border with Eritrea, and the conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border cost hundreds of lives in June.
The analytic fears that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media for the past few years, when cheaper smartphones have become widely available and internet service provision has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly done especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke out about how they gathered for the protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oromos and the Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amhars are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and trade, exploiting the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
“We are on the path to a unified leadership,” said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an undisclosed illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around a corner.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at exposing initial signals of discontent and using envoys to process opponents and gain his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative obscurity in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they have no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such riots in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts described as an election that the government had botched and then stolen.
A crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - albeit fewer than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual build-up of disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked business firms owned by the Tigreans, and resentment against the Tigreans on social media has become increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement on Obama and ISIS Funding as “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign, saying he didn’t mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He is also putting his supporters in an uncomfortable position, who have defended him diligently in a stormy time, and he must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really had no intention of saying that the president and H. Clinton had created IS.
In a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the one-day-old claim, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease the remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking the destruction of ISIS, the Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has attempted to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy, while his preferences in election polls have been declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel on economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump attempted to revisit the issue.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to a tax increase, saying that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he garnered a wave of criticism when he proposed that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remark by saying, “I am, of course, sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some of the messages have a response from his supporters to see how they react, and then, according to the reaction, one way or another, ‘give an explanation,’” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who tracked the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that he is skillful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained in different ways.
As the results of the polls continue to fall in his favor, Trump has taken an even more taunting tone in recent days, instead of softening things up for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Tump far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump even tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or of not understanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces heightened attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his devoted supporters in an awkward position to stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a newcomer, and it was because he had withdrawn his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed IS to flourish and failed to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to rain fire on the media on Twitter for rehearsing his every word and being biased toward him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” TV scholars who try to understand him and said, “They can’t do that!”
Several Democrats sneered at Trump's apology, saying it was just further evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
The café has been pushed out of the market by prices. Now it is back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of the front of a house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a sprawling city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is ransacked and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is also good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original café, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bread maker and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even reused the lighting from the old Verbu.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
Sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions are on offer.
You will also find bowls with brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of the original regulars.
“Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
There was even a time when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee altogether for a while.
“I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbo,” she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she's had a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been committed to Verbu since 2003.
They go to work and always order the same thing.
“At quarter and eight every day, like clockwork, I come and they are already preparing my bun with everything and butter,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order the usual, but occasionally has bacon, eggs and ham on his bun.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
“I think we could still use it,” Rodriguez said.
Also, the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint accepted the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it to make his new neighbors feel at home here.
The new location has other advantages.
The local fruit juice producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
It is possible for the cafe to expand into a neighbouring building.
Many customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopens, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
“I missed the smell,” he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and ate lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose liver pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: eggs in a diabolical way in tomato sauce, potato puree and for dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, is dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane’s book, 97 Orchard, tells the life story of a Lower East Side apartment building through food.
Their new joint paper, A Square Meal, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed culinary solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a slice of chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and scrambled vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which, according to the couple, was perfectly suited to talk about food during the crisis.
“The meatballs were very popular,” said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean meatballs were sold.
They were made from the ingredient and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe sneered.
“They would lie in your stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal looks at how the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of plenty.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious dishes such as meatballs and casseroles, casseroles as “an amazing way to use leftovers,” Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the focal point of American food - has become an alloted luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional filling, took precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During the surveys for the book, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a favorite addition to the evening table,” Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman said: “It was surreal.
Peanut butter with roasted onions does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of homemade recipes.
Like never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, a sher of the Federal Bureau of Domestic Economics from 1923 to 1943 - controlled the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urging women to take the reins of the budget, and turning pickles such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
“A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, the desserts were created in response to the government’s hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “I’ll have a pie.”
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he dined as the select millionaire he had become.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn’t made him set the example with his own stomach.
As the book recounts, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House “not only serving almost the bleakest meal in all of Washington, but also the most dishearteningly prepared.”
Many of the eating habits of the crisis were gone as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy has remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says they had a better understanding of Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits during the writing of the book - perhaps why she couldn't throw away the food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman said, “She made people sick.”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum cream,” Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged a spoon into the dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a good farmer, he said to his wife, “A little chopped walnuts would be good.”
Europeans: Migrants are going for benefits.
Most of the refugees coming to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the series would look like if we did it.
A group of Russian artists calling themselves 2D Among Us are making fun of their native country.

Gilead is entitled to pay the cost of legal representation in the case of the patent against hepatitis C against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of attorneys' fees incurred in the trial of the Hepatitis C patent against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the ruling was overturned, according to which Gilead was to pay $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents in connection with the highly successful Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni drugs, after a federal judge found repeatedly illegal conduct on the part of Merck, among other lies under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a statement on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to waive fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed troops claim full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now combing the city after the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city left.
The troops freed more than 2,000 civilians detained by the militants, said Sharfan Darwish of the SDF and Manbij Military Council.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, stating that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in that year and paid an actual tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million to the joint coffers for lectures, and the former Secretary of State awarded an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for his book on his time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published their tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an actual tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency,” Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign, said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to release tax returns.
“Your move,” Hillary Clinton’s campaign aide said on Twitter, referring to the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special adviser to Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits were over.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican Party members, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charitable contributions, business transactions, and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton made a strong stand on the issue, posting a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, he will raise the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades - publish their tax returns," she said.
Politico said Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist cited a number of tax advisers and accountants who say this may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure everyone who earns more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffet called for Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been audited by the IRS and that Trump was “not afraid” of the tax office, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign published tax returns retroactively until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, their wages are only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported an income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human dwellings - they throw condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
Honeyguide, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this procedure and trains volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania how to use this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second step is to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If this does not deter him, then the so-called "chili cloud" will be thrown out.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom with a firecracker, its end is knotted so that only a wick can look out of it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually one blow is enough, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to set off fireworks, which will trigger a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director leans into Berlin hotel for removing code to call Israel on Arab 'request' - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have a code for calling Israel, according to the employee, based on a "request" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel in a list of hotel call codes.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it that in 2016 Israel was removed and erased in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Kempinski Hotel Bristol instead offers the option of calling Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, “shocked.”
A hotel official replied that the measure was "decided upon consideration by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move made the director even more excited.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel’s calling code be erased,” Lanzmann said in a letter to the staff.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a great disgrace.”
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
This is a huge shame in itself.
The fact that such a thing happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong online reaction, people described it as scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel was simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” says another post, which points out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges by calling the event an "overlook" and apologizing to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order" not to include Israel in the list of calling codes, a Kempinski hotel representative said.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
A student-police clash occurred in San Paul, Brazil on Thursday as students gathered to demonstrate against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals made by San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin to save money is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying signs on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate decided to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, after lifting sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been a surge of interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are re-establishing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade was ensured by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
For the first time, Iran has been among the top 20 countries by the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the well-preserved monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner rushes home after the British won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio when the trio of the VB team defended the title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of a brake, which Sir Chris Hoy took for his Scotsman, and the young man delighted the legend when he rushed to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for specialist opening racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye's departure, a seat was also vacant, which was attempted to be filled by Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was along with Hoy champion four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but the jersey took over in the first round New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving on a higher gear to slow himself down and allow Kenny and partly even Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped on stage, he kept an eye on them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen onto the runway on purpose after a poor start.
He later retracted the note, and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time there was no such problem.
Hindes said, “With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London.”
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We’ve lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days are waiting for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
This would then mean a total of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy - on March 23 (this date seems sacred to British sport, on which day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrate birthdays).
Just like Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and will last for the next three days.
A 28-year-old native of Bolton said: “I’m enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
That was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest for the four-kilometer team pursuit race.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) take place on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will certainly focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioners when the referees called on him to measure the height.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations decreased during the preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of racing at the velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of Portland smelting plant after end of energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the plant with electricity, which has announced the intention of one of the owners of the smelting plant to terminate the electricity supply contract.
The move comes after the Victoria state government earlier this year decided not to extend the subsidies that keep the business running.
The 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa Portland may be at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closing.
And because the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be additional avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting plant in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland is in for a loss and is in danger of closing.
The move follows several years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the plant’s production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelter from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects any of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp. hold small business shares.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, in other words, demand for electricity from the smelting plant will continue,” she said.
The AGL said the contracts were so-called “reinsurance contracts” that were due to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“The AGL continues to expect contracts to contribute to the profit for fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL profits from fiscal 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts according to its ledgers of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to end the contract "does not affect its ... ability to operate a smelting plant or secure the supply of electricity to the smelting plant."
The U.S. company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect from November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL chief operating officer Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If these two companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It wouldn’t be good for us as a producer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashians' reality TV show - she's now the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the clan, Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the front page of the September issue of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who performed at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page makes me want to cry,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of humorously performed by the Kardashians?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar brawlers Rob and Caitly and along with them all favorite uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgot about the cover of their sister's classic party, just to make it a secret.
It’s the storyline of almost every “birthday” episode of a children’s TV show (Seacrest says, “Did you think we’d forgotten about you?” with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could feed on that publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we're definitely entering a new era for the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pushed Kendall to the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the whole year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition, 615 pages were with advertising content).
Unveiling the star appearing on the front page is eagerly anticipated, so it’s no wonder that the magazine’s images have leaked before its official release in the past two years.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more “celebrities that make models” on the front page than “models that are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar-winning and Dior brand ambassador, made the cover in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Laga Gaga.
But while it's highly unlikely that Kendall - whom the magazine describes as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not the relatives of famous people, nor the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all this).
They are talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in a reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "whores of the moment".
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.

Community Legal Aid Centers Refuse 160,000 People a Year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community-based legal aid centres, and in the sector itself they are preparing for the impact that further restrictions on funding will have on already over-exploited services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unfair evictions and the like - are rejected as soon as they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to burst, are about to make further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers will lose an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of community legal aid centres in Queenslade, said that according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, it was found that 5,000 people are rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without repealing the federal government's decision, the situation would worsen.
“The community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has cut funding by 30 percent, leading thousands more of Queensland’s vulnerable people to navigate complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Queensland Attorney General and Senator George Brandis to prevent this funding cut immediately, so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the state government has lived up to its commitment to providing legal aid funding up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centers of legal aid and the community of their clients, and Palaszczuk’s government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after staff member allegedly pointed gun
New York: A lawsuit has been filed against Donald Trump’s campaign for alleged inaction after they were told that the North Carolina operations director pointed a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court file handed down Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software campaign coach in the state.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that "it will not happen".
Director Earl Phillip "pointed his fingers at the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the file, Bordini found after a complaint with local and regional campaign leaders that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Weapons don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and holders (which is regulated in the U.S. Second Amendment) could step in if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and allowed to appoint her judges.
The Trump campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of violence, and causing emotional harm.
Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently retired from the campaign.
No one responded to the call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services within a short time.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
To me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games have brought huge benefits to both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would ridicule ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out that they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion pounds, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have put in place an ?11 billion infrastructure investment programme on schedule and with a set budget, from the T5 terminal - voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, to the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure our future trading and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy for Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game of cat and mouse in ad blocker
Attempts to circumvent advertising-blocking programs have turned into a cat-and-mouse game for companies that profit from online marketing, at least according to one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block ads on the social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to figure out which parts of the page are adverts.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been bypassed.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source community and those trying to get around it has been going on since adblocking was invented,” and that Facebook will likely come up with another fix.
The fact that the company owning the world’s largest social network has been involved in the war only proves how big the problem of blocking ads for the industry has become.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, around 200 million people around the world use ad filters - nearly four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The company is, however, going against desktop advertising filters because mobile ad filters for mobile apps for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people a better way to control how ads appear to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said it was concerned about the new Adblock filters because they could also block non-ad-related content on the site.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman was run over on the highway in the early hours of Thursday morning by several cars, possibly attempting to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Vaud police said in a statement that the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to police, they have still not all been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who have witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said legal counsel Gilles Hofstetter for Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Could the impact have been prevented?
The prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The victim was reported to have been drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - drove in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "quite an exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should report to the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects that up to 20,000 visitors will come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
Kateřina Petříčková, the executive director of AČCKA, said on Friday.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings together the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people took part in the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, due to its high level of tolerance and wide range of specialized businesses," Petrickova said.
According to the survey of organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of CZK 3,100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are supported by special maps of Prague with a complete list of gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
“For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, are interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spend more than others,” Petrickova said.
This year, the first Pride Tourism Symposium takes place as part of the festival program.
It is attended by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The parade, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will mark a minute of silence this year in memory of the victims of the June night club attack in Orlando, where the attacker shot dead 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate 40 years.
The irresistible do-it-yourselfers Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining both small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than 100 countries of the world, were cartoons by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two handymen Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited dramaturg Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to work together and they created the film Kuťáci.
Today's form with a yellow and red trick and a bead and radio show got the characters in 1979, when the Short Film Prague began to create a series for Slovak television.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the do-it-yourselfers in 1985, this time shot directly for the short film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own animated film studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other artists, many of them involving Beneš’s son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with stories of these do-it-yourselfers, who never get angry at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm and finally are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the well-known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters, and the characters and other toys featuring Pat and Mata are a hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sport and one life.
Both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What do people spend the most money on at airports?
This is a Friday review from the world's websites.
First medal of the Olympic Games.
The island nation of Fiji is a historic success.
Rugby selection of this archipelago was defeated in the final of the Olympic tournament seven rugby team Great Britain.
This is the first time Fiji has won an Olympic medal.
It took sixty years to get the first precious metal from the Olympic Games.
Great credit for the success lies with the coach of Fiji.
Ironically, it was Ben Ryan.
He has been leading the team since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen he could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can play the biggest game in our history," he said.
Fiji has finally mastered it, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
This was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's just like me," the two-year-old said as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis B in less than a year of life, with doctors giving it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got a view.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words “Hi, I’m Harmonie and I don’t have hands.”
Look at the joy the doll brought.
What do we spend the most money on at the airport?
CNN reports that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson’s travel essential stores chain has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers in its stores at airports most often buy.
The water was the first.
The drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M candies with coconut flavor.
Can you guess who finishes the top 10?
It is the only thing that cannot be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
“We’re just going to win,” Murray and Bond laughed.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have reigned supreme in the helmsman-less category for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing the competition since 2009.
On the lagoon of Rodrigo de Freitas, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
How are we different from others?
We are simply prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Frankly, we don't do anything different from the others.
We train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy," Murray said.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-meter and one-hundred-pound millet, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, Murray has a charity boxing match, for example.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric gets on the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference demonstrated that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, it destroys the opponents with calm force.
They are moving at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead in the middle of the track, the opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go the first kilometer full.
We're just trying to drive at a pace that no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crews at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to move to a two-man without a helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, they probably had the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was intense.
We did everything the coach told us and they didn't ask us anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were doing well mentally,” Murray said.
We know that everyone wants to take us off the throne.
We still have the target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for the Study of the Universe have developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated with CO2, could have prevailed similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's low rotational speed can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to have a thin Earth-like atmosphere, while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was probably drier than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus also used the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
“In a simulation of a GISS Venus, during a slow rotation, it exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats the surface and creates rain, creating a dense layer of clouds that act as an umbrella and shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than those currently on Earth.
The model has compiled a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was likely habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans have evaporated and water vapor has been scorched by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of a greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing his inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move, saying the club would immediately begin looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that impact team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and over the past two years, he's always missed games after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season scored 39:39:4 and missed five points to get a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who signed for the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on North Sea oil rig resume talks and interrupt strike
Top officials of the negotiating parties said that strikes over wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea are being interrupted, while all parties to the dispute have come together for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade union organizations can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process for resolving current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is as much as 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The company rate cut comes after a 10 percent cut for offshore companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately after a mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disagreements of an entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said.
By comparison, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotational speeds of stars from the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between stellar mass, its age, and even its history in the solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, California.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching maturity and have formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it turns the fastest.
At peak speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation speed slows down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate at a slower rate than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"We see in the Pleiades 'ballet' that the slower-spinning stars are more massive, while the ones that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
“The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, for both younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation speed and, so to speak, “hang their dancing shoes on the nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotation speed in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualifying Agreement Necessary?
If I did not sign up, then the qualifying agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in specialized education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now an open job only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year there could be a vacancy in another one, where I would like to work afterwards.
I don’t know how to deal with the situation for the next six months, the question continues.
Responds Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the return of incurred costs associated with increasing or deepening the employee’s qualifications.
In the field of health care, there is a long-term pressure not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the occupational mobility of health care workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Pursuant to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions of obtaining and recognition of professional competence and specialized competence for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialized education is considered to deepen the qualification (not to increase it).
This means that a qualifying agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legislation or obligation to apply for special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applying for inclusion in the field of specialized education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to practice the profession of a doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary university studies, although under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation in which professional practice completed in another field of specialization may be included in the specialist education of the doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer’s situation.
However, due to the fact that I am not familiar with the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health by law provides advisory and consulting services related to inclusion in specialized education and its course.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors in Aleppo, Syria, are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (the rebel part of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to promote the protection of civilians, the letter to the White House said.
"We don't need tears, compassion, or even prayers; we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours to allow the safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CEST, all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, but said a two-day ceasefire was needed.
Obama was contacted by 15 of the 35 doctors operating in the eastern part of Halab, who are controlled by the rebels.
During the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world is watching and stating how complex Syria is, but it is doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like lightly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors have said.
Doctors said 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria have been recorded in the past month, 15 of them on the hospitals where they work.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
Young children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we do not even have the necessary material to help them, doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion interrupted the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They gasped, and then their lives were over - before they could really begin, they recalled.
An army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break the encirclement and launch a counter-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides were then given reinforcements in the city and its surroundings.
