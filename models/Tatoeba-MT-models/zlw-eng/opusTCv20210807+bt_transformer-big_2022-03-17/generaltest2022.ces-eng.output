The great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Paul the Frenchman has been drafted into the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Franco, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Lithuania, Plzeň and Russia's Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He was in the middle of the game with Vegas and has not appeared on the NHL rinks since.
The incident occurred when an experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel French will be out for about three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body," the Denver-based team said in early October.
His return to the NHL eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He scored 94.5% in the AHL.
The Pilsen hockey player finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his senior year, he had problems with his hips, and in the shortened pandemic year, he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL "Frenchman" scored 36 games, his success rate is at 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camilla’s mask at Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as a Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles used a photograph to help his wife Camille wear a mask at the races.
This was reported on the BBC’s website.
Wishes are sent to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they cooperate.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte is also wearing the dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt just like Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not give, it is not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card photo on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their rural Norfolk mansion.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein spotted them in Ascot in June.
Charles, wearing a hat and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask in a color-coordinated light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season from the Prague Slavia.
He informed the server efotbal.cz that he had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club, said that they did not engage in any corruption in red and white.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly features its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and former second-league Vyšehrad sporting director Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
Criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berb) should have a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to CSI, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board, Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He rejected any kind of corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, we have not sought to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this respect," Tvrdík told the Seznam News channel.
Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former players of Slavia dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was triggered last year in mid-October by police intervention in several places, including the FACR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking player in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer present in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, along with former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillers must from an armored cabin and wear cartridges by hand without covering).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, it has already managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a chase right next to town.
Nutria came out of the river and did damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before he came out, but of course, the fox was coming in a little while.
I let her walk 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving the headband on all sides, so I called him that it was a fox.
He was gone by the time I got out of the chair.
I mean, even a meadow can be a pusher.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, dear things put at your feet in a spacak and you should be fine.
War versus Hamas.
Respirators are much cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts per respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why are prices moving so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy the stock?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of iRozhlas Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and armies (I am probably not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak Armed Forces that older generations have experienced), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from the obligatory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of technology that could be used by trained people, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the capabilities of the midfielders will rapidly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where one can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to re-train someone.
And finally, backup/territorial defense is of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas are going to lead and it is also a stated necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for it.
We don’t have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have one.
Then there’s a situation where you look like a guy who didn’t hit an empty gate two minutes ago, runs into an attack alone between two or even three Swiss and you say to yourself “tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?”.
Of course, he’s treated like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "getting a defender" is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised when I see that our striker managed to beat one player of the opponent.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much it is helped by vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained from previous illness.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented with paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As said, the first to reach domestic patients is Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on tape first because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to saying 'how our beak has grown'.
You see, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the UK, most people will tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
Afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
They will really know what people are thinking.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour are both over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to learn again where what is, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the SSS did not want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory either because of the safety or the speed of deploying the warheads due to the western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads were kept, not the whole rocket, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some support device.
In addition to the museum maple, the others are in a state of disrepair.
In the second grade of primary school we had a fellow Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he walked regularly, he was engaged in sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to school in nature, did various ape shops, but he was fine, perhaps never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same year, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I have sold to Gypsies often, they always had money, they didn’t try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called in a month that he already rewrote it on himself.
I say that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, work, women do not beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, stretches out his hand, settles flats and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble... so it doesn't matter what color he is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she succumbed to her injuries on the spot,” said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian emergency services.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle probably drove in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for reasons unknown so far drove in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, Štěpánka Schwarzová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian police, described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugotu suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained trapped in the car.
After the rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice, said rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
They mainly collect cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he now has to add VAT and forward the data to the customs procedure.
He receives an e-mail saying that the customs officials expect the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not already included by the merchant at the sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier’s remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click on one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 items in the international mail that we need to process.
If people were to fill in all the data that is needed and fill them in on time, we would be about half there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
The solution to inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to continue to grow.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is an employee)?
I was added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run at work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to prison for only 6 months?
This just doesn't bother me how a court can send an animal like that to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention that the rape victim never has to recover from it either.
Doesn't this also deter potential future reporting of rapes of victims?
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Tomb inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to himself.
He took a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged “robber” told them that he had made everything up so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then found that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore handled by the PCR.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavic, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit them.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world, if I am not mistaken, of about ten thousand different religions.
Which God or God should one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
There is no other god than Yahweh.
Would it not be more rational, then, to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god I missed would send me to hell or some such place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months on one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All of the ACR's components could use something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: The cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly tumbling, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intermingling going on, when the labor force is migrating from educational institutions to employment relations.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
Similar overlaps should also exist between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never come here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Oh, my gosh.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to cut their budgets and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already once shown that it is enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and population that can control the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so what could not.
We don't need border fortifications, that sucks today, but a gnarly teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home crammed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
That’s why we have created a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging, which is currently lacking on the market, as well as the money saved, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of eco-conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of such shops is also TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling materials are transported to Popůvek near Brno by individuals who are gathered at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the home, where to return expired medicines, tires, retired electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All rubbish can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project contains over 100,000 such places.
“We are gradually adding collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliď Česko association.
It seems to me that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because for example Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency last weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for Europeans to be protected - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they could not be done in six months.
But French politicians like it, and voters like it.
Macron’s right-wing and left-wing supporters agree on a few things, but Europe does.
In France, there will be a new election in April.
The election calendar also had an impact on the priorities.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron for being pro-European and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Right now, the far-right candidate for French president, Eric Zemmour, is touring France, claiming that the Vichy regime that collaborated with Hitler during World War II was not so bad, and has had quite a success with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at the events in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won the award for directing and for the best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he stayed at the top of the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" for a few days I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than the regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Personal experience only. I’m not saying everyone has it that way)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be released on December 20, will include a traditional literary appendix.
And with it comes cultural tips.
We attach the books to this digital edition so that you have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts that follow the previous similar collection of Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observation of the world and description of everyday things with extraordinary poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
A story about a return to roots, which turns out to be just a longed-for illusion.
The Bohemian and comparative artist brings the fairy tale of the Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of the current village.
Its brutalization overcomes popular versions and escalates into a horror about emotional emptiness.
And that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a rather less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who have stayed and those who have left know too little about themselves to spend on living together.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change
From Sunday, trains begin to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where the RegioJet starts to run instead of the Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or their route will be adjusted slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Ticket sales began in the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services per day in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the new timetable, the tracks will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be delivered by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by 3.2 percent on average from next year.
Tracks take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Every day, RegioJet will run a total of 16 routes on the track, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at the Havlíčkův Brod, Zdar nad Sazavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 routes, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of the trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
For example, passengers are waiting for changes in the Českolipsko region, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk, Trilex trains from the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, die.
I've never heard a teaching from a slave party or from that time on, nobody's advocating it, they're just condemning it.
No one will even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not met anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and in my opinion it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings, it’s just what it is, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they too had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
And the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people forget that not all of them in the South were slavers, and a lot of things bothered them too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our view does not exist in them (on YT there was also a video from TV where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as ridiculous in the US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
All in all, it seemed to me that in some universities it was appalling, those students were quite radicalized, and those schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I am a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has already achieved what it had and it is not about the same anymore, it has become radicalized.
Today, feminists are defined as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT and this leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they can be heard.
At the end of the day, I have never been convicted of colonialism or slavery.
I was in the wrong geography, but it was two-way :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality generally unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If I have interests, worldviews and shared experiences with people, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks some cock about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they are born of Catholic modernity and are de facto Catholic without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to Hussite services because it's theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they do Mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
Flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to the Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him this time because of the coronavirus pandemic, but they took him over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it to the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year, the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right at the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the Scouts traditionally took a train to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will receive the light at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame in the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, Scouts must also follow the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
This is happening just like last year.
We are giving recommendations to both courier teams and organizers of local events to wear masks, try to keep distance, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in a way that it was as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread simultaneously with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, of light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of gratuitousness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don’t have an economic education, so I don’t know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don’t think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education make good use of this money, but I do not understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and undermines the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy-funded/co-financed" signs in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the retardation of development when this company is both holding and depriving orders / employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don’t think internet ads move me, but then I find out that they have influenced me - it’s just so sophisticated that you can’t always resist it.
That is why I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban the Internet.
I feel that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
“I won’t believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion, which I’m going to say is critical thinking.”
“I don’t believe everything the media says.”

TV shows have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, this year they premiere two hundred
Los Angeles - Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, and this year a record-breaking 200 will be presented to its viewers.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience, which is why these films are being made more and more.
Four times as many Christmas movies were made this year as in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included only those images that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday movies.
Films traditionally associated with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, and films such as Alone at Home, Love in Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the true boom in Christmas movies did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came out with a special film series.
Her Advent project Countdown to Christmas included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, the competing Lifetime channel has 35 new Christmas-themed films and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
“In this magical period, the story doesn’t matter that much, the important thing is that there’s a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it’s snowing,” Brandon Gray, author of I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies, said.
“For viewers, it’s a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday craziness and the craziness of the world we’ve been living in for the past few years,” Gray said.
Hallmark, for example, still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then a misunderstanding arises about half an hour before the end, which, of course, is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It’s like that over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, Gray adds.

In the last race of the season, he had to attack for a better position from the 20th place, which he took in qualifying.
Russia’s Nikita Mazepin of Haas won’t interfere with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin’s teammate Mick Schumacher, the first Max Verstappen to face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin, according to the Haas stable, is quite well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all parties involved," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement rider to the race, nor can he.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides at another part of the weekend.
The first racer does not compete with the covid-19.
At the start of the season, the covid-19 Kimi Raikkonen was tested positively last year by Sergio Pérez No. Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It’s a bit like a portable jewelry store and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home we never wore sweaters much,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3000 hours on his work in six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, 24 carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarovski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater a softness,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
“I’m completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible,” Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost “only” 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries, in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
There are already British and Estonian troops on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adam's.
“Currently, we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam’s preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county in the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that these are two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four have asymptomatic course.
No one suspected Omikron had traveled abroad.
None of them had traveled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had any contact with anyone who was abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová has previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being tested.

California will restrict the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced plans to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the nation’s most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law after detecting an embryo’s heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who makes or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement came in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Friday that maintained Texas’s ban on abortion, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent-setting verdict that established abortion rights across the U.S. by roughly 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it by the usual judicial process.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Texas’s ban on most abortion services and to a large extent support Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” he said.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect human lives,” Newsom said.
He said he had instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the state parliament and the justice minister, to work on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers are called and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who makes, distributes, or sells assault rifles, “ghost weapons” parts, or kits to make them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private prosecution, then that's exactly what we should do," he said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state actually reinstated the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of the liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing select officials in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where the vaccine schedule is gradually being developed and the vaccines themselves are being improved, based on the results.
For example, Israel is already in a large study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule after a while, but it’s just too soon for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on the inactivated virus, should be on the market soon, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.

Poland threatens to suspend payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting against the law if it used new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use the mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries violating the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified in view of the fact that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro’s influence threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Ziobro said Brussels was building “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces “a political diktat carried out by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept concessions from Brussels that would limit Poland’s sovereignty.
“We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony,” he said.
But know this... In Lidl we have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn’t look for other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had him, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is a dodge, I will not smell any more in any market, action, gold shop in the square, maybe they do not have such a choice, but usually they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I have been watching how data is treated like manure here, most opponents of vaccinations are just a little more out of place than most proponents of vaccinations.

Binary reasoning: vaccinations save us, vaccinations are useless.

Sorry for the outburst and good day to you all.
I was punished with a spoon as a child.
It was never because of grades, mostly just because I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catching" the spoon only brought and put it down so that I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I received a few blows to my ass (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice in a way whether he will not obey and will get, or will get better and there will be no punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defence of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalistic question about what the Czech Constitution means to him - whether the sacred document he swears to and learns about at school or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once, in the Constitution, we agreed on democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl then glossed over the question.
Recently, however, the opinion among lawyers is increasingly emerging that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
One thing Cepl was right about.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies across history encounter.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we tie the politicians to the bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, they are fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby in FN Brno
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also difficult cases that hospitals have been struggling with lately.
“We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, the head of the Department of Pediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we are seeing especially in the recent period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place in the clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus have recently been on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the ward according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease intervenes alongside adults both adolescents and several-month-old babies.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"Today, we have a child of several months and an adolescent," said the head of the department.
However, he is happy that no children have died of the coronavirus at the FN Brno children's hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, he is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation in the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
“Therefore, we recommend administering the vaccine to children as well,” the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the game fields).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside the marked roads is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).

China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the contagion, which turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in the number of infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend and says, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's awesome.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, the car washes the trunk, the children play with it.
That's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
It's going to be fun, it's going to be great...
After a while, they meet and the person who bought it complains: “Dude, what did you sell for an elephant????”
The lawn's been smashed, there's huge shit everywhere, the car's been wrecked, the kids are scared of him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The man who sold said, “You talk badly about an elephant, you don’t sell an elephant like that.”
The world is dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works for its integration.
It still operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will be successful.
I thought of that, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm just speaking Czech.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that they are both from Spain, while in the case of "Spanish fruits and tangerines" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further with the American forces.
Again, maybe I'm just saying :D
Either way, it’s a meaningless request.

Vicki Holland of Britain tortured the cosmonaut Milly
Scary footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at her.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has banned her from keeping animals for life, reports The Sun.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a spaceman so terrified.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A four-time mother has pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to a 12-week prison sentence in the Gwent Magistrates' Court, with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was given a lifetime ban on animal husbandry and has to pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehab will go on even further.”
It took Milly a long time to get used to people again.
She cringed and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage in the woman's phone after a raid at her apartment over drug charges.
The footage shows Milly swearing vulgarly.
The next video shows Holland offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, confessed to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine was found in her house for ?1,600 (roughly $50,000) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same stuff in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And it's all killed by the idea of bifling, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you know it or understand it.
Just write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and on the street randomly ask people if they can manage to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority doesn't even cross their fingers and tell you they're totally screwed.
So what the fuck are they learning for?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people do not want and have no need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly learned for the many people who will need the thing.
But, like, the remark that you don't really need all this to be standing at the machine, I meant absolutely seriously... because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably also the case with our communist past and the incitement against the educated and elites) But the cost of these machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, covid probably never reached this size.
Wedding at a glance: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right now,” Andrea said on Instagram in Stories to curious fans, who were so disappointed with Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
It's been going on between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather turned into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was upset by Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri’s ex-wife was not liked even by his younger sister Linda.
He decided to speak to his brother publicly.
I don’t normally comment on such things, and we’ve never said much about these things in our family.
I don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, it just won’t do me any good!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, even at how young he was.
All the more I regret when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would like to know Kadri as much as I do, my family and my family, in response to Andrea’s words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and we know the reality and we know how it really was.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cao started his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than climbing up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
A security camera shot shows him walking down the street from a crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
She then caught Cao.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day of the incident.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while he was drunk.
The whole thing is under investigation.
A drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and effectively tied to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

It held a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies, said ČSÚ Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the epidemic of covid-19, the elections were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.

They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you'll have someone to argue with.
If not, it is sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raised, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, where rescuers from the Regional Emergency Medical Service intervened.
An hour after midnight, the regional operations center received an emergency call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Immediately, two crews of ZZS went to the place - medical and medical.
Upon arriving at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old had fallen from a window about 20 feet [12 m] high and hit his head on concrete!
Coal was caught in the pits.
But not as it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to the other care of the Ostrava Traumatology Center, said Lukáš Humpl, spokesperson of the Regional Health Service.
I am more concerned about the coronavirus than I am about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 tournament is over.
Outsider Julianna Pena managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in light weight, he showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The winner was also Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This brought a women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pene.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf" because Nunes did not lose for seven years and sharpened her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave the opponent a push kick to send her to the ground.
Pena, however, did not allow herself to be forced to make any further mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself using a lever on her hand.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Pena got Nunes on the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and pull the trigger.
It was a huge shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier did better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
Although he did not do much, but then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and showered him with a series of wounds.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock off the choke.
The Brazilian defended the title, but Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley won the first round by putting a hard right back on Raulian Paiva.
He then beat him with a series of precisely aimed strokes and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it is not difficult.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not difficult for them to determine whether they are male, female or medium.
But then there is also a fairly numerous group of nouns, for which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
They then take on double ends and in some cases remain in an unobtrusive form.
For example, the words "clamp" or "hip" are masculine and feminine, in the former they are inclined according to the pattern of "machine", in the latter according to the pattern of "song".
For other groups of nouns there are different shapes in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/row", "kelluben/kellubna" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are scriptural, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "pike" and "pike", "dough" and "dough", etc.
Some words that have penetrated into the Czech language from other languages were originally inclineless, but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle gender unobtrusive, but in the masculine has endings according to the pattern of "castles".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped resisting them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
What does the situation look like on the ground?
We haven’t seen the blue sky in three months and we were suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has been battling for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves cope with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison have done more to prevent the drastic effects, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaking to Sydney journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don’t know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how often their surroundings or even the police treat these people.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusation is made up" and that it is a "trend" you only help sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods with houses under construction, families don’t have money to finish
Prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people find themselves in a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the means to complete the construction of family houses, and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already built family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people are moving into built-up and unassembled homes.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay rent,” says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two or three family houses in a year, and at fifty percent it happened to us.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on five million dollars to build the house, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some of them will wait,” added Slivoň.
The most expensive material was copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favorable.
“The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Křeček said.
We're fine, and we'll be even better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator ČOJRozhlas
Entering the New Year, in addition to traditional celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, apart from the Prime Minister and President of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
I have my own topic, which I chose, I follow up on the bachelor, I always work on it all year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The stateswomen are completely calm in our country, if a man is not a total macaque and there is something left in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him on the theory.
For example, I studied at the state school for a week and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which immediately worked out for me and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it many times, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they are done.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is an exam in which the knowledge gained within the project is reflected, not just a defense.
But don’t overload emails and phones and send no packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be a dick like them.
The people at the embassy may have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pooh bear.
You might want to put her in a position to hit Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta throws sticks at artists.
As soon as you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, it constantly changes what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been pissing me off lately, so I might have to cut to the point where a lot of the artists in my line of work are successful and can't quite let it go.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly that doesn’t suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Workers' Party of Donbass
The Union - yes, the break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
In the White Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitics reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they “abolished” a vast country of nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one session in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, put a brake on agriculture, and broke away from the world’s greatest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, then the Soviet camp.
There is such a concept in political science as the “vacuum of force”.
Everything that was hastily betrayed and given up was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'm gonna buy it and put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday at 120 CZK and left it for 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
All this talk about when something is cheap, it must be bad, bad or poor quality, they are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
I recently went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the temps, they can't throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nowhere was anything about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agitator.
After reading it, I found out who published it and finally Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
Too bad for paper, because of this the forests would not have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with this person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me not to go.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and she started to squirm on her head.
Then I ended the relationship with the fact that I told her that I was breaking up and lied to her but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not get any amok.
Such a person will suck out your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep the distance
When insurance companies are furiously stealing from here by buying a cloud of tests and rushing for positives, who wouldn’t even know about this terrible disease if it weren’t for the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they have already stopped the clowning and acknowledged that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing faggots.
I see the good old bastard's coming back.
After several years of sedition and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruitment is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was sincerely interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the trainings were more about how to scare and talk people.
When the first money came in, one quickly realized that if one wants to make money, he has to make a few sure products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so one felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one has learned that one should not jump on every speck and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn’t put them all in one bag.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I've never seen a lot of that in a corporation where I work.
HR is calm, managers mind their own management and they don’t stick their noses into anything.
So regular evaluation happens somehow, in the form in which it is quite possible in our country (set some goals for the next year, next year we will look at what came out and what did not) - it's more a self-assessment, than that someone would rate you by some numbers, and the like.
Company activities are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels that we are such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so it doesn't bother us as long as there are results.
Czech woman missing in UK is dead
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, Jakub Kulhánek, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradist was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our London office that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not give any further information on the case.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The last time a young woman was seen on a bus was on her way home from work on November 28th, when she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues five days later.
Police in London are searching for her, and Interpol has listed her as a missing person worldwide.
It has also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this regard a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspects, but she did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four new municipalities were appointed.
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mosteckou, Nová Ves na Libereckou and Rovná na Pelhřimovskou.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected representative office fell apart.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates were nominated for 28 seats.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were appointed.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men applied for the seats.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
It held four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and staffing, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous contagious disease here, but it went without major setbacks.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population at all its strata is, I have a problem with that so far.
I am looking forward to the vaccinations (tomorrow!) because thanks to him I will finally be less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be deprived of the office of president and the ability to re-acquire it.
The chances of this happening are very small, as others say.
Besides, I'm not sure that shredding a file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex for a whole year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
They are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who renounce sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the past year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks and video games could also contribute, making sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having sex for the previous year has been growing rapidly,” said Lyman Stone, an IFS researcher.
Among married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% reporting having been without sex in the past year.
For single people, it was 29%, Stone added, that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married couples under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it’s a bad thing, while about 70% think it’s okay.
“It’s true that single individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend,” Stone said.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among the “less religious,” the trend has risen from 10 percent to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also found that people with fewer jobs and lower incomes were less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replacing” this need.
This trend was mainly due to the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandate to vaccinate against covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to behave that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question that I am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, if we don’t tell them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we would certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn’t really know much, we didn’t explain it well, he overheard some misinformation, and as a result he didn’t get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who here, alongside the SPD and the Communist Party, shouts something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year’s winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about the boss.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, which we probably do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but a friend and I had a conversation.
When she left, I asked her and her teacher what she had said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
“I told them I had no soul,” she said.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
There’s not much going on, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honours.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis, triggered by worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normandy Group”, associating France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the chancellor was informed of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and used people as live targets and a weapon, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin can finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz said that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, she tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was already being driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When she was told by police that she could lose her driver’s license if she didn’t give priority to driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police came for Sister Celestina.
She was subjected to a breath test and after finding out that she had over two per mille in her blood, she was immediately stripped of her driver's license.
At the same time, she was told that she would testify in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech family comedies are seen in American stories about dogs.
But they forgot one important thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After the cheesy film F. Brabce Gump - the dog who taught people to live, now the audience emotions in the cinemas are competing for another film Here we guard.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava boarding house, who is dying, begin to invite a dog-sitter, Julia’s father and her partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) were already struggling with the narration procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's recap.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course, during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, could shoot them in the forest.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
The owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the content of the pelmel full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
Two thieves from the staff, a dog show, a charlatan from Šumava, police officers coming to look for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which, of course, the family in the pension will get drunk on.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits on top of the cigar at the family table, demanding her father’s whiskey and flake as a cured vegetarian, you can’t help but laugh.
On top of that, the viewer will explain that “sometimes it happens after a coma”.
Šajmovič’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build bearing situations, a sense of character and point and direction.
Performances are unbalanced, cut clueless and the overall impression sloppy.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their party, they have little to play.
The only feature of the film are poetic shots of the Šumava nature by the cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters make.
The argument is not even the long-term membership in the Club of Dachshund Breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Behind good intentions to promote nature and friendship between man and dog must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family shot there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur-oriented piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and here you can see how shit you understand it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to that kind of stuff all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case a part-time job.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen on some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only a 6% long-term rainfall average for November.
This week’s rain was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is bumpy and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring with the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water companies have been warning of droughts for a long time.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here,” said Uri Schor, a spokesman for Israel’s water authority, in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off economically.
In the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan, there are more and more tankers.
Waterworks and private wells are drying up.
“This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” Imád Suleiman, the truck driver, said in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military intervention against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the talks in Vienna had “no progress” and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and that world powers “understand that the Iranians are toying with them.”
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled during the interview to find out what she really wants from me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really do not like these scams, so I bothered Miss for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I'm a punk, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, there was enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have started operation as a result.
Skiers were also not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate.
While lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set out to cross-country trails and ski slopes over the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said Jakub Hanuš, the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season also to the Jeseníky Mountains.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, with an estimated 400 people arriving on Saturday and today.
Conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period after experiencing covid-19 disease.
With exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told ČTK.
"We have only detected units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not the same as in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokishova from the Opava shop Skiopava.
He expects more pressure during the ski courses.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Hradec Králové Snowbear company, also feels that due to covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, ČTK Šinták said.
People became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, there is a great demand for rental in the Novako area on Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested already have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to borrow the runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the complex.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and smart people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company will not just leave.
Totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, reigning for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections.
If it's a bad life, some traditional V4 lunatic can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, their supporters will remain, and the people whose property cannot be put on a plane.
Awesome photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodshot photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is this a make-up?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
“Petra’s disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we’re starting to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of Lambeth Police Department said in a video posted on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is,” she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her co-workers on December 3.
She was a nurse assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the group said in a tweet.
"We would encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Harriet Harman, a member of parliament, also called for public cooperation when she called attention to Srnc’s case at a press conference on Saturday.
“She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death,” she said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel like we all have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have previously detained a man in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of doing.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I am not underestimating Ukraine.
These are not "huge quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of an invasion and is getting tired of our entry.
I quoted above.
I don’t know why he thought Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out on so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the first Punic war and the "anexia" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That’s all it is, and that’s what “concentration” at the border would be like.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) expect several changes from Sunday, especially regarding suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, ceased to exist.
Mladá Boleslav is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop express trains from České Budějovice in the station Zahradní Město.
On the suburban train service, S7 trains run from Beroun to Český Brod via the Prague Main Station.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop in the recently opened station Prague-Zahradní Město.
PID will now expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and 12 of the operating lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague’s Zličín, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and on the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten Central Bohemian local lines has been cancelled or limited, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch at the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a break of 30 minutes and my only option where to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I do not have any exercise, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as much as possible healthy and diet.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy a maximum of pizza buns and a snack yogurt and an apple.
Q: What would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket without the need for heat treatment?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you are, unfortunately.
These are not the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're not allowed off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confessions of a Gift about a relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been living nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been dating since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a message to her fans explaining why she has been hiding her love from them for six months.
“I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěd,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he picked it up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we were both not looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether it's the ones who don't care about it at all, and it's the ones who pop out of the can, or the ones whose lives they're dissecting.
It is as if one of you wants to hear the opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or whether you insisted that everyone should really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's the rush, that's what you want, Dara's upset.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd is a long-term vice-president of the football club Juventus.
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for Nedvěd’s divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife, Ivana, have been separated for three years, but they have not been married for three weeks.
Thank you to those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That’s why I love my new husband, and like him, I stand by him. For better or worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, other commenters have probably already said everything essential, I just confirm that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually met and befriended during the first semester or two and found sublet together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments usually do not advertise very long in advance, so you probably will not find much now, but looking at the offer will certainly not hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejla, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francuská, etc., this is a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
In contrast, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, the King’s field and it’s fine in that direction, besides, it’s close to most of the BUT faculties (I don’t know exactly where you’re going).
I have never sought rent, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not fund some schools enough.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it out of their own way or they go according to the state and pay for it by the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will throw a few crowns into the full state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier had expressed his opinion on the petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing / digitization that (even long-time professionals) either somehow throw it away, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite legible, so I probably would not recommend it completely.
Personally, I would have handled it in some way depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and search for the one closest to you.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on that coin.
P.S. Isn't that more of an Odry Empire (kingdom) than an Odry N?
PS: Someone's already broken it.
Take a look at this comment with H
Politicians have no idea what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, anyway some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, the English language is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10pm and never have a problem?
That it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly entered there in his life.
Yeah, probably most of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but all they do is get in the way on the sidewalk and park where they don't :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and Gelem's mistress like a stake in a fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent wreath lit the first candle, Felix Slovak did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dady’s wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras’ words so much that he visits her often.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
I still don't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
But we talked all the time, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on a regular basis and I will definitely buy something for Dad and Lucia, probably perfume.
I’m a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the Richman Club for the launch of the music video.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says the Slovak, who was happy to meet the wife of Luděk Sobota Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it very clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few police officers and they cannot afford it, as well as firefighters and nowhere else is such a high percentage of health-trained people at this level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava is on the heads of previous governments, not the army, it has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreased in mountain and sub-mountain areas, a smaller amount of precipitation is recorded even in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
However, the impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the land.
What should you be prepared for when it comes to drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it’s going to be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don’t know what hockey is and that tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total buzz.
And whether you're a "bear Russia" or a "Lama China" hockey team, losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who point out, what the referees do not notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And Imho, if it were the other way around, it is as usual, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be the classic "smell lost" vs "WE have won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5,766 people were hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 per 100 000, 871 per 100 000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest number since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The death toll is 1132, the lowest since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Safety Authority, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalised in the UK, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
No one has died from omicron yet, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after the infection and deaths occur about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson administration minister claimed that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election by an overwhelming majority.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from his post as prime minister.
It’s amazing how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for an election in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán’s 12-year rule.
It will be an EU-wide election.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because that was not the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one is that in practice everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
In the past, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kávér, leaked to the independent media, where he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom’s parents are not very patient, neither am I, my dad has her for a long time, but then she bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I was very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and was all blue, I was taken under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they were happy with my upbringing, sometimes it was more like they didn’t know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things by force now, as a child I was struggling quite a bit, now I hit something for discharge and as a younger parent I was slapping my hand for example (so that I didn’t get too much on my face), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell how much of that is my explosiveness, but I'm sure that upbringing has a part to play in that, too.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks something up, it is probably impossible not to spoil their children at least a little, so I do not blame them.
I’m not ashamed, I don’t understand why you should be ashamed.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call them the ones who make laws of such quality.
I wonder if you’re worried about a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product, and you will have what to pay the mortgage from?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of journalist Kuciak’s murderers?
In Slovakia, the trial begins with four defendants for the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but it also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How important will the process be for Slovakia?
Journalists are to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical schools, which came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled, and the company got away with it.
Czech television was dying with covid just six months ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of choosing a location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can be really effective only if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The presented proposal for a material intention almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in permitting proceedings.
The proposal lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting a location for storage, its authorisation and operation.
According to today’s legal norms, municipal officials do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain permit procedures can they submit comments or appeal, but the authority or minister in whose interest the permit is to be issued decides.
Any action shall not have a suspensive effect on the performance of exploratory or construction work.
The co-decision of self-government that the Platform asks for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following up on the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for these works, according to the register of contracts, is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the locality of Hrádek and spokesperson of the Platform Against Deep Repository said: We expect a more significant turn from the new government after the ministers of industry, who straightened out the position of local governments in relation to state authorities in the search for a deep repository of highly radioactive waste.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a crucial building in a similar way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Deep Repository Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state’s approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repository.
The platform further advocates that the decision to select a location for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman, 69, has been forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he did not need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
He was told that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He made his debut in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put everything in my mouth,” he said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
“I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still anymore,” Goodman told ABC.
It also depends on which boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If this is some text on a platform that expects readers from the game environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and perhaps a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain boss.
There are many types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like a lord / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not needed to beat at all in order for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games such as Half-Life, where bosses are, but the player does not directly interact with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called something like that?
And then there are the mini-boss.
It is probably not possible to translate the boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it (only Catalan is interesting, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for the missing Peter from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman has been searching since December 7.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular for it.
The whole world is searching for Peter.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
“We share information about the case,” she added.
The search for Peter has also appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the suburbs.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She was involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face.
“We’re very worried about her,” she said at a news conference on Saturday.
British police have arrested a suspect in connection with the disappearance.
It is unclear who he was and what he had to do with Peter.
The Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in offensive campaigns, attacks increased significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
A big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla was recorded on November 18.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
An infected attachment in an email is meant to draw the user’s attention to a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month’s dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was marked as a copy of the repair receipt for 11.2021...exe,” said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored logins, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATIONS.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts at Fareit, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months, are reporting a significant decline in activity.
Today's demo of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and in my experience, the protestor is not afraid of an estimate of about 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment and bridge and the opposite embankment communication.
This means that people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about 4,000 protesters.
“Something new is being born here,” Radek Mokry writes.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led them to find common ground.
Only the antivaxers, the anti-cruisers and the like could not fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of Chčípl pes have an increasing popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they are renting the same stage and technique.
It is difficult to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the money supply, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It will not be a left-wing or center-left movement, you bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose because it is obvious that we will have to get revaccinated every six months.
I’m glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has commissioned Kiril Petkov to form a new government from the anti-corruption movement We continue the change that won the November elections.
It has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The “secret” footage is a global hit.
There was growing concern over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been under investigation by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago on her way home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the information about the child hospital worker is also called by her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
“Petra’s disappearance is nothing like her behavior and we’re starting to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of Lambeth Police Department said in a video posted on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is,” she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her co-workers on December 3.
She was a nurse assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the group said in a tweet.
"We would encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zdeněk Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children’s rooms in Šumperk (as well as a regional pirate councillor), has reported anonymously that his paintings violate copyrights.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of Mole in Šumperk’s rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was life.
The municipality referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not react, the hole went on.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began to “intensely address the situation”.
