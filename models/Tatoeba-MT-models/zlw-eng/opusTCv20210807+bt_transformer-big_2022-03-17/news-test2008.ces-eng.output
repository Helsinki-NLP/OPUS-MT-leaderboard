Inflation surges in Europe due to food prices
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant increase in food prices.
November's price growth in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation was recorded at 3.1 percent, the Luxembourg statistics office of the Union reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issue banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the base interest rate, with the reduction, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, leading to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must “destroy” inflation so that it doesn’t have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation is a record of 3.3 percent for 15 years; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to soaring food and energy prices.
The futures price of wheat rose by 88 percent, and the soy price reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets rose by 52 percent this year, and last month it already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain about 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement after a prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December has grown significantly, so now it has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists the Gallup Institute has never measured such low support - 13 percent.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support compared to the fifth support of the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
There are one percent more supporters of both camps among certain voters of the party.
The public’s view of the economy has also worsened compared to the previous low: the proportion of those who consider the country’s economic situation to be very bad has never been so high: 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families are now assessing the change in their material situation more pessimistically after the spring and summer more hopeful prospects.
As for next year, the greater part of the population is counting on further deterioration and only a tenth on improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, the most of any Gallup poll to date, said the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány believes or strongly believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orbán’s share is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54 percent, the leader of the Fidesz movement by 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While after last October’s riots, the government and the prime minister’s tenure was deemed desirable by 35 percent, the current figure is only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in holding new elections.
It is significant that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that the referendum would definitely come, and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
For comparison, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly be attended by only 55 percent, and another 15 percent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be undoubted on the basis of the current intentions.
School fees would be 74, doctor’s fees 79, and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people certainly promising their participation, then the introduction of tuition, fees at the doctor and fees for staying in the hospital would refuse 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth of the price of Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budapest business triangle maintained last year's, on average, 16 percent increase in price levels, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas basket of Napi Gazdaság newspaper in the Budapest business triangle has grown by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price has shown an increase of well over a thousand forints.
Since the prices in supermarkets "flew" last December, the percentage due to the earlier high base did not show such a drastic increase.
However, it is certainly disheartening for consumers that what they could have bought last year at a price below nine thousand forints, they will not now buy for even ten thousand.
The daily economy consumption basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but it was very expensive for cruel breasts, nuts and poppy seeds.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilo of bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca Cola in a returnable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a down payment, the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the Napi Gazdaság newspaper’s consumer basket, Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket increased Cora by 15 per cent compared to last Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan increased by around 18 per cent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumption basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was an average of 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and apparently the department stores were unable to decide how large the price range should be for individual products, as they could not predict what effect the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If a trader plans the speed of circulation of a given product incorrectly, he may lose a significant profit due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year’s rise in the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest one had a price difference of 844 forints.
This year, the most expensive basket cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one cost 1,284 forints.
Compared to the previous two Christmas seasons, prices have risen disastrously, raising the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, among other things, does not absolutely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase in excess of 30 percent in 12 months for several staple foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the daily economy consumption basket, it seems almost impossible, because the price level of the product, quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of barely above 10 percent, given the base even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers appear to be in stronger positions than the egg suppliers, and they have also managed to push through a drastic price increase in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business golden triangle do not complain, they still report a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three stores they visit are no longer interested in prices.
Everything is bought by quanta, durable food is taken by wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets were forming long queues at checkout as the number of visitors soared.
However, as we know, the turnover in the countryside is lower, many international chains complain that sales lag behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also durable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overloading of disease control staff do not help, says the head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they are also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who was hospitalized after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier this year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after he had to return with MRSA infection, and due to the bacteria found in his body, one important operation could not be carried out yet.
By December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections due to multi-drug-resistant agents had been reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina B -czová, the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant disease agents have been registered with certainty in hospitals, others are unknown.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin resistant gold staphylococcus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infection, morning infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are given in an exaggerated or inappropriate way, the antibiotic-responsive bacterium develops into a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterium that spreads rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, for example, morning infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the head doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections belong to the daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not just there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of a disease agent is not investigated."
Resists antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treat them with rubber gloves and a mask, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable for the prevention and spread of multidrug-resistant disease agents, says Karolina Boerczová.
Since this infection is typically found in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals receiving patients should screen and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It is also important that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these tests.
Most cases are revealed when the patient suffers from a perceptible MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict guidelines for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical histories.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not follow this in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even rarer for basic or outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina B -r -czová.
Saved on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are serious deficiencies in hospitals as well.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in home hospitals.
On the contrary, rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals, which are in an unfavorable material situation, they save on disinfectants, there are few caregivers and many patients, which increases the chances of infections.
According to Karolina, where the necessary protective measures are followed, such infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the disease can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treating MRSA is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA and reduce its incidence.
The program seems to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a decreasing tendency.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) places the prevention of multi-resistance disease agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these agents among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII. district, who caused the fatal accident, is ready.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII. district, who killed pedestrians on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his position, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, the spokesperson of the High Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital city Attila Morvai reported on Friday after the expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the police headquarters of the XXII district knocked down a 55-year-old man in front of him on Tuesday in Lajos Kossuth Street in the XXII district with his own passenger car as he turned off the road.
(The latter fact, that the pedestrian was crossing outside the zebra, after all, according to the rules of the road is not mitigating circumstances, the turning car must still give preference.)
After the transfer to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police director stepped down and asked to be retired, according to police reports, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks worth a total of EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for Hungary’s budget financing of transport and environment projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement worth EUR 150 million is also used for budget financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, with the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which the budget will use mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk about the 4th metro line.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original treaty needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with a waiting period of eight years and without a commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying on the EU’s still cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for real estate is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
Of the mountains, the most in the course of the area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will attract investors sooner or later, and more and more people are buying in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
Also, the capital of Sofia is a promise of attractive options, business and office premises promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf resorts in Europe, becoming a popular destination in the next two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foresight investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more often from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present here, along the Black Sea and in the ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settling people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category is the cottage buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of increasing their value in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate in the capital is continuous, as the demand is getting stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but they have risen by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
The rise in property prices far exceeds the rise in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, the meetings of experts will be closed on Tuesday and the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with the ministerial meetings.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts following the period of emission reductions defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries about them.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to negotiate precise figures now, although it is in favour of an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 relative to 1990 levels.
The next big issue at the conference is whether developed countries, in addition to reducing emissions, will also agree to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that rely on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Board, most likely within the framework of the UN’s World Environment Programme (GEF), according to the journal Piac és Profit.
The Hungarian 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to a 30 per cent reduction if other developed areas of the world and developed countries are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments appropriate to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set themselves the target of a reduction of 5.2 percent, with the then 15 EU member states committing to 8 percent.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which our country will meet.
There is a lot going on in Bali, as an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be postponed to 2012 with certainty, in which case the reduction commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed up by a new emission reduction system, the necessity of which has also been highlighted by the UN’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body in its latest report.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military forces are posting videos of their self-promoting actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing server.
The British Air Force (RAF) first took a liking to YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of actions against the Taliban here since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Headquarters directing combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable.
In this way, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already been accessed on the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have already looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenseheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes footage of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force released the videos according to its original intent for recruitment purposes, and according to the Department of Defense, they are also good for acquainting the general public with the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
"The promotion published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional TV recruitment ads," defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, "but it also necessarily carries a certain political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans played a game.
The military is worried that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also sent to the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in somewhat hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers at most talk about losses, but they do not perform a bloody form of combat.
After all, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released, but the British army has only just discovered them.
Americans recruit a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through a more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of soldiers.
Christmas will be at the ministries with raffles and paws
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to paws and coffee with 2007.
At some ministries, the celebration will be live music, elsewhere it will conjure up the officials’ Christmas atmosphere with a raffle and a toast.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - that's how the powerful have fun.
Government agencies are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year, but it does not wait for its employees.
At Christmas, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions will receive gifts, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort donates 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are thrown out of their hooves compared to other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the centre of J?v? Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and out of six hundred Ministry employees, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a raffle draw.
Christmas NF - cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
It seems that one department of the NFA is invited to another Christmas celebration: it will be organized by the tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) with EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the Vígszínház Theatre building.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we were unable to reach the relevant person.
No need for a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the National Fund, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized the St. Lucia ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
But he did not want money from them.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with a greeting of the minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball were not mandatory evening dress or suit at all.
The Puritan party is planned by health, labor and local government departments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperthová does not even officially invite co-workers to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and puffs, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the auditorium of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, at which 436 workers are expected, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he donates 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with buffet tables and a toast.
Since being Minister János Veres, PM workers have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officialness will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Ministry of Agriculture organizes a New Year's reception on January 20, the ministerial Christmas does not take place.
The reception will take place in the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Gardens and according to the Ministry, 1,000 forints per person will be allocated for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting to the minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not host Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told [origo].
They were unable to disclose the price of the environmental ministry’s Christmas celebrations in the press department.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Decorative Arts.
A giant strike is coming.
The League, or MOSZ, will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s indefinite strike.
On Saturday, there will be a protest public assembly, on Monday - the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance - work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause serious traffic disruptions, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League association together with the National Union of Workers’ Councils will introduce the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike commission LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
A protest public assembly is held on Saturday, with unions joining the strike stopping work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
That is, there was no date set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the next steps.
According to Monday's agenda of the Parliament meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted on until late in the evening or at night.
Due to the strike that begins on Monday, serious traffic disruptions can be expected: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, part of Budapest’s public transport may stop in the morning, and more than half of the companies will be Volán.
At the same time, half of the track will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations announced a strike for an indefinite period, others announced a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people travel by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the previous announcements, from the beginning of operation until 1 p.m., the strike will take place at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, and the Trade Union of Educators and the Democratic Union of Educators called for a 2- and 2-8-hour work stoppage respectively.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), organizes a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is for the government to revoke the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions, effective from next year, be introduced gradually.
Third, to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the scheme before 2010 for early retirement for the relevant branches of work.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), belonging to the League trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the country's risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several ways, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Institute of Political Capital.
In the context of the Hungarian Guard’s activities, the greatest political risk is posed by the fact that “the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary may soon lead to violent ethnic clashes”.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an action, the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of the Hungarian political representatives: "public discussion of the Romani question was left by the representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy based on the Romani-Hungarian contradiction."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the Hungarian Guard's activities, according to the research institute, "largely damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of faith in the country's stability and its democratic maturity".
As part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has been receiving increasing publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, several organizations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves "national militia" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, invasion of the homeland, disruption of order), in addition to pointing out the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
He goes on to note: all this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap all sorts of political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and parties in civilian attire.
Thus, the emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups serves not only to avoid the legal obstacles of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, while the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries, citing the establishment of the Hungarian Guard, want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this can have an impact on the political stability of the region,” he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
For example, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish a guard, saying the organization's goal was "national militia".
She said there had been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the country remained inactive and indifferent, according to the Political Capital Institute.
He added that the initiative sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Romani organizations that they will create their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Since the activity of the Hungarian Guard so far bears similarities to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is possible that Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way by establishing their own militia, we can read in the Risk Warning prepared by the Institute of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they release a risk analysis every year and if they find anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, the days off are set by law and it has become common practice to move working days around the holidays, which is expected less often next year.
In the European Union and in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and national holidays and public holidays.
Days of rest are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year here: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a working holiday - on the New Year's Eve just so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
There are a total of 11 free holidays throughout the year.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, a commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the foundation of the state, on May 1, work, on November 1 and 2, we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, the two-day holidays are Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become the practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of long weekends is that we stay in the workplace and at school the previous Saturdays.
The day immediately preceding or following the holiday has been regulated by a special decree of the Minister of Labour for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, with regard to their purpose, also operate on business days.
This year there will be a change in the working order only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because, according to experience, most people will "work" in advance between Christmas and New Year's Eve or use the holidays saved in this way.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around the holiday of work, so that then the workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, will be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, the work will take place instead of Friday, October 24.
However, the end of the year next year will be able to take place completely in the sign of holidays, because from December 24 almost everywhere will have nonstop holidays, despite the fact that New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six little things you can do to annoy your colleagues
The emails we forget to send, the voicemails we never get, the innocent lies we hardly notice anymore: all of this makes everyday life in the workplace “more varied.”
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves and unclear situations that can make others angry, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague tells you.
That you missed a meeting because of it?
At best, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or calls the marketing department and says that he forgot to deliver the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is solved with one apology.
Before making an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that isn’t yours?
There’s nothing more unpleasant than reaching out for a document, an office item, or your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover a pen on a colleague’s desk that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will be rightfully angry at you for going through their things.
Do not take envelopes or adhesive papers out of the office, as they can be uncomfortable if you run out of them early and you will need them immediately.
Rumors about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the spread of rumors.
Who, who, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don’t put your personal information on everyone’s face!
When one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Do you report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence, citing a severe headache, because you are not feeling well, or you think that today you would rather rest, remember that someone else will have to do your work, urgent tasks and work for which they have a certain deadline for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you need to stay home, report it so that your colleagues and managers will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Humiliation, giggles, phone calls
Have you fallen into a job that will grossly pull you out of the giggles of your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently witnessed a phone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Don’t disturb your co-workers by grunting, chanting, loud talk (over their heads), or stomping, constant cursing, loud discontent.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something is not timely or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to the possible chaos reigning in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you could make things right, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Sweatpants and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear clothes for leisure, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a regular dress - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to be satisfied, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes tempo and the bass is added to the previous tonal timbres, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
On mr2 is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
Home music has not spoiled us with quality electronic pop for a long time.
Suddenly, however, the traffic looks quite different, because you are listening to the new Zagar album.
The revelation of Yonderboi, a pair of new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the overall picture, and although garage rock is back in fashion with its guitar thumping, even home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pétikostelí and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until finally - perhaps because two pipers do not fit into one chord - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
"Ference T?r?k's film "Season"".
His formation, playing in smaller clubs at the beginning, became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entities determining the development that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are without a doubt "on course", although of course no one asked them if they are satisfied with this label.
The band responded as it should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Insidead may open up new avenues for them, although the title itself seeks to establish a continuity with the early years in The Five-Churches.
This is one verse from a song by Balázs Zságer.
A reference to the ethereal, flying would be in place, but next to the ethereal touch of this music has now appeared - in keeping with the spirit, trend of the times - louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
These songs were performed at the premiere of the album in the Millenaris Park by the singer Gyorgy Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Pet-Fi station, playing popular music from morning to evening, we began to cling to the sprawling melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
Portal hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much of what you play remains marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music doesn’t mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they say nothing, and it can be created just for sale, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can stem from a sincere inner need.
It is in this spirit that the attitude is adopted, regardless of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers and people in their 20s go to concerts there, but also older people.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music that are taking place around them, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
Q: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more at concerts, where mutual influence already works, but it hides only in the impenetrable changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you want to suit the audience, from that moment on you cease to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works as a soloist and has built his career from us to the West.
B. Zs.: We do not actually follow his path, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music in this way.
We are more like team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, of course, we could not avoid comparing our work to Yonderboi’s, as a few of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: The song "Wings of Love" reached number one in the toplist of mr2 Pet-fi.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
With a more popular style, did you consciously open up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn’t plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, with which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
Q: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to assemble this choir from soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir - Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik - Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - got together, which we then christened the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that how you intended the song, or did the girls change something about it?
B.Zs.: The song had existed in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material came together on the record, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
The sequence of chords tempted him to join the singing part.
That night I sang a melody to him, which was later learned by the girls.
It all happened at the very first time and spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it took Wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that way energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert it seemed that there were girls in the background.
They don't have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, they sing completely together and they're no louder than the music, so the music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were also in the back of the stage.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to separate solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little about our ego, where someone is from, where they belong, and just letting ourselves be lifted up by those wings, the wings of love.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born could be felt by others.
HVG: Which one was the most important?
B.Zs.: During composing the music actually not with one, heavier pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he did not want to groove, then everything slowly found its place as in some jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is constantly changing by touring and by the fact that I have already "released" the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Betrayal broker risked billions for inferiority
A treacherous embezzler.
This is how French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of Komerční banka, describes his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
He lost almost 5 billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compete with his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized early on the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's mentally weaker," his superiors said, sending the police after him.
However, according to Kerviel’s testimony, which was reported by French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who at the end of last year had profits of 1.6 billion euros from his trades.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros from the American crisis.
He saw the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
This crisis had no impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit reached 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
He admits throughout the interrogation that he falsified the records in such a way that they could not be found out.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange became interested in his business.
Risk was Profit
Was he afraid to find out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 became a standalone broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew that he would never earn as much as anyone else.
“I knew from my first interview in 2005 that they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after his arrival, the first big success came.
Thanks to the shares, Allianz made a profit of half a billion euros in the bombing of London.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told police.
But the bosses knew about it, or rather, they knew.
"As long as I was making money, they were turning a blind eye."
But then came the morning earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to wipe it out.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
A few days later, the bank reported that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I’ve only had four days in the last year.
A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic may receive EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Around CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to raise around CZK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in the newly adopted countries in drawing money from EU funds.
20-year sentence for Nicaraguan ex-president confirmed by court
The Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, for which he was sentenced in 2003 for $100 million in financial fraud.
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time.
According to Ileana Pérez, the president of the appeals court, it will now be up to the prison officials whether to let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in the fund that Aleman founded to fund his 2001 election campaign.
We approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
Last year, it passed with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford its non-acceptance.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, law peacefully.
It's a paradox.
Each rule begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s power rivalry with the opposition.
That’s why it gets so much more attention in the media.
The debate among politicians is far more interesting to the public than the austere figures.
State budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three ills that they are unable to solve at the same time in 2008:
The first is a high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandatory expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and the KSČM before the elections.
The second one is deficit management as a result of the first one.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to the money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, to obtain additional resources for investment, often recklessly issue bonds with which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling of shares of the energy and other distribution networks they received from the state from privatizations.
They no longer have that resource.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years, constantly boasting about the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the government has become more and more indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more wisely than our republic.
This is a huge embarrassment that falls mainly on past governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have just in recent years completely unnecessarily swelled to gigantic proportions.
Even if some of the nonsense populist spending approved this year before the election has been eliminated, if the retirement threshold and pension reform are not pushed forward in the near future, then virtually every policy in this country will end, and whoever rules will be merely an office.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money for pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the displacement of normal expenditures by mandatory expenditures.
The planned deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments had not managed to make as much profit as they could over the last ten years.
If we do not want to see the ruling politicians turned into mere bureaucrats, then we must be patient and allow this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get in taxes and fees, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in the financial markets.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be auctioned into the currency markets.
In these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, while the other 24 will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is intended to address the economy’s greatest difficulties, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group, wrote in his report to clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-performing loans, primarily in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what might happen next when they decide to do this," said Amro Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are worried that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will be expensive to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with possible impacts on global economic growth.
Central banks have decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about borrowing money from each other, despite the fact that central banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks will help to stave off the crisis, because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the US real estate market.
The debates among environmentalists are incredible.
Global climate change is expected to be most damaging to developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
The UN conference on climate change in Bali has come to an end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue Planet, not Green Planet, he stated that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that its topic is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions".
Now, however, you can read his unbiased statements.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had enough qualifications to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional papers, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists about the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When asked, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver did not change 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not manage to change their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will go on the road.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged especially by those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities are reporting a sharp decline in interest in a driver's license exchange, the city's authorities are overwhelmed with applications, and interest in a license exchange has risen this week.
The municipality handles around 2000 clients a day.
We wait in line for about half an hour.
Around 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences in Prague.
It takes 20 days to issue a new card.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a reduced period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not have to change their license before the end of the year and leave the road without a valid driver's license will be subject to a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
A police officer can also deal with an offence.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to CZK 2,500.
According to earlier information, even a person who is not going anywhere could have been fined by the town hall.
He could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has previously called on authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum fine of 1,000 crowns.
According to Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, however, there is no risk of fines of tens of thousands.
A driver’s license is a document that people can choose whether they want it or not.
This is not an identity card that every person must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
Just take it away or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
By the end of the year, passports issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
Motorists will also need to change their driver’s licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminally conspiring with David Berdych's gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
The Supreme Court of Prague has decided to reduce their sentences by one year and by two years.
Originally, it threatened detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is waiting for a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences in excess of 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court recognised 19 people for their participation in robberies, and the Supreme Court today heard appeals from 16 of them.
Most of the defendants denied the charges from the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, provided information to criminals from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Koňařík.
The charges relate to the criminal activities of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of the authority of a public official and illegal armaments.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core bullets, a laser sight and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has stolen tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the nearly twenty men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the vicinity of Berdych are still testifying before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Children's exchange account: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the injured families, wants compensation of CZK 12 million for the exchange of children in the maternity hospital after the hospital in Třebíč, plus court costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for the father, and a million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Therefore, Ondřej Dostál, the hospital’s legal representative, strongly disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But in order to be able to make an opinion about the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the opposing party has had drawn up.
Let's see if it has any value at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should range between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, a family from Jablonov wanted a million crowns for each month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba was served as the basis for negotiations on compensation by an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress in varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they were faced with regrets that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, are harder to cope with the reality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, Veleb summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč maternity hospital last December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina Governor Miloš Vystrčil handed over CZK 100,000 to each of the families to reimburse them for the expenses they incurred due to the error of the Třebíč hospital, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, the amounts were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The soup has lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Wallachian Kingdom brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, although the term was first used by the Wallachian king, the project was built by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor.
The soup wasn't in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing Bolko Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone remembers the words of the Wallachian Kingdom as an actor and a comedian.
Harabish has the same opinion.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Getting money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize our work,” he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the Wallachian king used the term for the first time in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the idea of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionist action turned out to be a business and lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then followed up with the establishment of the Wallachian Kingdom company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to give his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts while visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Polívka published in the manoeuvring for his business plan.
"The popularity of Bolesław Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, which was intensively devoted to him.
The cooperation of today’s warring parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the deposing of "King Boleslav I, elected on a permanent basis".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken up by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabiš could bring a contest for the throne and half of the princess to the dispute.
A new king should come out of him.
The details and date have not yet been revealed.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
A king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polívka can sign up,” added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
In fact, I’ve never been a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the gearshift, steering and also production could be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the wagon called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the rear seats, for example.
This is the end of the complaint, because the wagon body means that not even two-meter tall men will suffer in this direction.
Flight through the world
I go through the interior very quickly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where the only complaint I have about the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design inventiveness, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
Also, the side rail has improved significantly against the 206.
As for the space, there is also a sense of an increase in the dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the above-mentioned lack of overhead space disappears.
Suitcases for suitcases
The main thing in this car is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (also thanks to the tilting rear window) and as well-stocked.
Deaf places are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched and at the same time it can hold even heavier objects.
Let’s talk about volume together.
According to the tables, the basic arrangement is 428 l, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot lags behind by a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is even critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, then I still have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre petrol four-cylinder engine with 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old driving a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, stretches.
If I compare it with the Škoda analogy, which sometimes feels like it has a stuffed rag in the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
Price list hints
The price of the car is not folk.
However, we must remember that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a petrol fortnight for CZK 329,900 is still good.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then throw the equipment for an additional CZK 80,000.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs 531,900 CZK.
It is a lot, but count the additional equipment at Fabia and you will come to a much similar number.
There is no choice but to choose a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
Children from Eastern European countries are increasing in British schools, raising concerns about the further development of local education among local residents.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of indigenous peoples escalate into violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case in Northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and fights between the pupils have also been transferred to the relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who was beating a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
She pleads guilty that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"As we were going home, a boy climbed onto a bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils told The Times.
The complaints are from both sides.
One local resident even called disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks in the UK who have come here to work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer enumeration.
But there is much more to be found on just one island, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by the human eye.
Havana became a storehouse and a repository of treasures that the Spanish looted in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the USA (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were mr.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses were built in Havana, and cars were used on wide boulevards, which belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his yacht in Cojájer.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of Havana’s Bodeguita.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, they will mix a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s still drive around Havana today, because the once imported gills and fiats in that salty and humid air have long since rotted away.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably dilapidated, yet nowhere in the area there are as many beautiful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province, as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more taste, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
A third of the vast plantations were transported to sugar factories by steam and motor trains along narrow tracks.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines, whose contours are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
So there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind that in the already mentioned Hemingway's homestead there is a museum, and who likes this writer, should not miss a visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vinales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows out of the limestone bedrock.
Mogotes, limestone loaves and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil is lodged in their cavities, making even weathered rocks covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is where perhaps the finest Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also be interesting for some people that the Chilean part of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad and Tobago
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and fortune were brought to him by the slave trade and the sugar trade.
Wealth has been transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the region to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was buried, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, it is also worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening, go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music stops at dawn.
Baracoa
A small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely such an opinion affects the path itself.
Both roads, which lead from Guantanamo, have to cross high and rugged mountains and pass through nature, which human activity almost did not notice.
The eastern island of Cuba has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO due to its unspoiled nature.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Cross of Columbus (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today's Hotel El Castillo stands, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the shrine of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about santeria, about the African religions professed by the descendants of former slaves, about all this one could describe many pages.
But, as they say, it’s better to see once.
Afghanistan's allies are passive, says U.S.
Few troops and lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called for NATO troops to become more active, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to allow people to start developing their own economy and security," Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan rebel activity is at its highest level in five years, according to U.S. military figures.
The number of violent actions has risen by 27 per cent compared to last year, and by 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been disputes among the participating countries about whether all allies are paying the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a fairly large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan waltzers revealed: Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the footage, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went on a counterattack and printed a snapshot of the British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The national debt will rise to $1 trillion in 2009.
For every Czech, the national debt amounts to over CZK 84,000.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget management.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the state debt from early October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Over the last year, the state has been indebted by more than CZK 111 billion.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could exceed the billion crowns threshold only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told news server iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, says: “We could reach over one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don’t anticipate this change,” he said.
Debts are rising
The state debt is a central government debt and is primarily created by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
So far this year, the state’s internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion.
So far this year, the state’s foreign debt has increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt has increased to 6.5 years.
Total debt increased by 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when there is pension reform," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The strategy of financing and managing the state debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget management.
The amount is mainly a deficit of the state budget, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It also includes the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds worth CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for giving the name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher, who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday evening and was expelled, her lawyer said.
She was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-olds to give the teddy bear the name Muhammad, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was subjected to the punishment of lashes.
The 45-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Sudan, was arrested in her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and insurrection, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in the month of September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"Eight names will be heard from the mouths of the children, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
After voting in class, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Muhammad as their favorite name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by a caption: "My name is Muhammad".
The bear itself had no label with this name on it, but the problem is in the very depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: “I only regret asking children to vote for a name,” he said.
This view is shared by many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and add that "she never talks about religion in the classroom".
Muhammad is also the second most commonly given given name in the UK, with 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible to give them a toy?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome differing views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to heed their commitments to keep the peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations ended.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is clear that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10
Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian-speaking, could be seen in a clearer light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, mark the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN mandated the Troika in August this year.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to close on December 10.
On the other hand, the Russians, who previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration by the international community, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," said Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of the Kosovo government, in a hotel in Baden, where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still under consideration and has warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of a possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "domino effect" in an area that is still unstable due to the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia it does not mean," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be taken solely by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"Kosovo parliament to have final say"
"For Serbia, only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
“This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the soil of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on status will be given to the Kosovar parliament," adding that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be "by agreement" with the West.
Bush wins deal with Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland convened at his instigation, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately begin negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything possible to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must put an end to its colonial activities, Bush said, recalling obligations for both sides stemming from the “road map” to the peace they accepted in 2003.
He said negotiations between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority were aimed at “concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues.”
The statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes in what is now the state of Israel in 1948.
Abbas took the floor after the U.S. president and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "overall and thorough" and touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert said that the negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that there should be "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for realizing his "vision of two states", Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had made a commitment to this effect from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal accepted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and against its central aspects,” Prince Saud said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking daily newspaper backed by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small messages from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not coincide with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the French State Police Inspectorate (IGPN), the police car passed shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday through Louise-Michel in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the emergency mode, but was on patrol and was travelling at 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on," the police source explains.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore unlicensed to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, drove "at very high speed".
"The motorcycle rammed into the police car from the left side after not giving preference to the right," one police officer specified.
A blood alcohol test carried out on the crew of the vehicle turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise), Marie-Thérése de Givry, reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which is also being taken over by the direction départementale de la séreté publique du Val-d'O'.
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police for the accident.
According to the official, three witnesses to the accident who were interrogated on Sunday night confirmed "the police's version, namely that the mini-motorcycle approached them relatively quickly from the left".
A groove, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the clips against the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained jammed until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, word spread quickly among the people that police officers were to leave the scene quickly without providing two young men with first aid.
The IGPN should, with all caution, also have ruled out "any serious wrongdoing" on this point.
"It's a more challenging aspect of the investigation that requires more investigation and that needs to be very careful," a police source said.
The newspaper Libération met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“Immediately my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, ran down to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "a limping, totally terrified policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke on the phone.
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and the certainty of the young people present that the situation is hopeless, the police were taken away by a car of a colleague who had arrived at the scene in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police officers".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not come to the young people's aid.
First aid was given to these young men.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, were used by law enforcement forces.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers assaulted and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court attorneys called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning, in order to prevent a rally.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who took an oath before Musharraf".
"Musharaf's promise doesn't work"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in an indirect presidential election, which took place on October 6.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and against the judgements of the Supreme Court," the official told The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to give up the military and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the imposition of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The deputy information minister also confirmed that the January election could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that the deputy chief of the army was to order President Musharraf under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies are unexpected.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or occurred in an unexpected way.
More than one in three (36%) pregnancies is still unexpected today, according to a study conducted by France’s Institut national d’études démographiques (Ined), the State Institute for Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law that enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or occurred in an unexpected way.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
After all, the enactment of contraception allowed for better “fertility control”, the institute claims, noting that the rate of hormonal contraceptive use in women between 20 and 44 years of age has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One in five couples even have their birth calculated on a monthly basis precisely and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed more than seven hours of work in space to remarkably repair the ruptured solar panel necessary for the station's further scientific activity.
It was a risky ascent into space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was planned, and the degree of "craftiness" that the astronauts spent on the repair.
Trouble emerged on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery spacecraft unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical body designed to install European and Japanese science labs (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pad for modules-labs.
They need to be able to supply electricity.
The crew's second task was to move the 17-and-a-half-ton module, which was already on the ISS, to its final location.
After it was moved, the crew began to decompose the module's 70-meter solar panels.
And in this one of the panels, decomposing as a pull harmonica, as a result of pinching the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to perform a control exit to the Discovery ship, and subsequently go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had malfunctioned, were forced to attend to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and made the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers of the US Air and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very skillful, has a very developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was entrusted by a doctor with the task of "operating" an "injured" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed a kind of "threat" on the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker", who remained near the buffer chamber, and also from within, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey wrapped in insulation to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "do-it-yourself" made by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disassembled and then inventoried his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when the seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are falling sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defense company announced it would have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face delays on the A400M.
EADS has lost 4% and is now listed on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 due to delays due to slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the inaugural flight.
The price for mitigating the delays in deliveries of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European constructor EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before interest and taxes (EBIT) at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that the production results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86% mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group expected to deliver the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Decisions for the status quo
Sunday’s election will take place without any high expectations: the Russians will overwhelmingly elect President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Affirming, after the end of very few free elections, their tendency towards stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded television message to voters on public stations, the content of which is, however, kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that seems to celebrate a crushing victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president didn't let anything out of him and was content with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite subject during the campaign.
"We know the value of true democracy and we want fair, transparent and open elections, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "never has there been such a dirty election, not even under Yeltsin."
Following the repressions surrounding the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians still have a homo soviet mentality"
There are two far more open questions behind these tight-knit parliamentary elections:
"Who will be Putin's successor in the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will elect a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win all the way through the parliamentary as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians still have the mentality of homo sovietica, they do not feel that they are the masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St. Petersburg State University notes a more distant connection: civil society has become late, Christianized in this country five centuries after Europe; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not bring terror, but a certain economic well-being," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "voluntarily renounce personal responsibility", which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
“What to think about?”
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čeredničenko, a 45-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which recount the fate of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, are opening up to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hess) were only accessible for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' free access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to examine "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental disabilities of some of the victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants set up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor subjected to civilian citizens, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin's Technische Universität, in 2006.
India and the EU want free trade agreements in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India already amounts to almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is the EU’s ninth trading partner, according to the European Commission.
“The free trade agreement will vastly overwhelm both economies” and “India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner clarified. The Asian and European giants exchange together "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" each year, said this week Dani?le Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential".

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England said it intended to ease its current concerns that credit market conditions would deteriorate again and announced a bid of 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, a bid that has been in effect for an unusually long time.
“In an effort to ease concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable by the end of the year and give banks more certainty about how to secure their cash position for that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period that will begin on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a statement.
The bank specifies that the GBP 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
This appears to be the first time that BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It normally takes a week.
In its communiqué, the BOE adds that it "remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates" on interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, the highest figure since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates that have discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many preferred the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist bill of purchaseability on Thursday, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the bill came within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by an individual parliamentary group) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, among which were an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of the fluctuating TIPP, a transport cheque or rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against discussing the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session was closed after a general debate that became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on affordability.
PS MP Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his club will again table these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the bill on finances, which will be debated by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is establishing a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer of Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic, announced by British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It's an honor to work with the man who inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 is produced by Chicago's Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, he is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Beginning in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 describes Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event" he has ever experienced, saying his firm and Melvin Benn's firm are working concurrently to give the region a European-style festival event.
“We originally chose Philadelphia as our market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, due to the current leadership of the city, we have become involved in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to establish a great festival in an exceptional venue that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
In 2005, C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after standing out on the festival stage by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross sales for both events for 2007 were 9.8M$ and 11.3M$.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benn Festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to somehow combine both concepts to create the impression of both a rural festival in European and an urban festival in American style."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastic about the event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to divulge the terms of the agreement, but says they are "beneficial enough to allow investment in such an event and to welcome a festival that will hopefully have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which seats 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed when the program is still in print.
“Vineland will have a rock vibe, but the music will be varied to attract a wide range of audiences,” says Carlie Jones.
C3's partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award in the final edition of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Faces the Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it.
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically challenging" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall into the hands of the “governor”?
“We need to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer the ones they think are the best,” he said.
The Hunt for Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all the West Coast festivals, whether they are in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the idea is to introduce Quebec films, draw attention to them and ensure that directors give interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Québec also presented four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts divided by the 'subprime' crisis
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the year, investors are already holding my hand in anticipation of a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts aren’t so sure it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context the markets offer, at least in the short term, some doubts."
These experts do not expect the stock market to move in the final weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially a fixed income affected by the effect of turnover on quality securities, both in long and short segments".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "mainly because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates (the Federal Reserve) is not known, due to the high level of oil prices and the danger of inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to make bold claims about a marathon.
“There’s not much to rejoice about,” the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year slightly closer to 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional deposits for supplementary pension insurance that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December, after the long weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "therefore we could observe the reflection of the index, triggered by reports from the US on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
Analysts believe that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles that will take Ibex to new highs.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the turn for strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it occurs.
“The ACS has been repositioning for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also do very well, although they are not very represented on the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of slumps in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (since January, Ibex has increased by 8.36%) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the Popular bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches, operating under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
As well as for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 8.30 pm and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly stated that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of business, or not.
This is exactly the goal of the project set by the Popular bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, entrepreneurs and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches across Spain in about 18 months, as this is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
The extension of the opening hours is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colours.
The commercial director of Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not mean a big investment, but more staffing as it moves from six employees to a branch of eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” Rivera said.
They have just agreed with Telefónica to sell the phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubles the value of its Antena 3 rival for the first time on the stock exchange
We did it.
With this sentence yesterday, Paolo Vasile, executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the deal, when he stated that the television he was managing had doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I regret is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less', he said.
And yet he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco exited trading yesterday with a 2.54% shift.
This profit pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%), according to Bloomberg data, is 4 488.88 million euros.
Its competitor Antenna 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and has fallen 40.5% overall since January, is worth half of $2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were valued is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in the audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first TV channel to surpass a billion gross advertising revenues this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespa, the group’s advertising arm.
If the forecast was actually achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in advertising revenue of 3.6% this year, up from 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net income of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay-out that it has retained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided 100% of its profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, who have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows some fatigue at these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently downgraded its Telecinco earnings estimates, to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to a halt in projected revenue growth from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same firm reduced Antenna 3's projected profit of 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Ibersecurity: recommends buying both titles primarily on the basis of increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: values Telecinco (to accumulate) better than Antenna 3 (to maintain) because of its 'numerous advantages' and growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not overestimating them, as they face 'similar threats' (oversaturated market and degraded economic environment).
Congress approves MiFID transposition effective November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary deliberations that ended today with a vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has subjected to a public hearing the ordinances that are developing the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of individual parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial advisory services to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons, and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments is increased by adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems that will compete with current stock brokers.
Furthermore, the Act obliges firms providing investment services to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of coping with risk on the market and requires to keep a report of all operations carried out to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
During a hearing with the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which stands out that securitised receivables were considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor that was demonstrated by what occurred in the U.S. with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Moreover, the directive's transposition has been used to legally define the functions that bachelors in economics and business management can hold 30 years after the Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure, which will become known on 14 December this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain a relatively high level"
Pedro Solbes, the country's second deputy prime minister and economy minister, said the ISC's increase to 4.1% in November was a "temporary figure", but also predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes told Congress that “even if it’s not a favorable number,” Spain’s inflation differential with the monetary union has remained “more or less” the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," said the Minister of Economy on the data presented today.
Virgin plans to earn 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock Bank went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to a distressed loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to as much as 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At the time, the bank was managing record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually declined over the course of two and a half months, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for this money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity’s name with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue put into UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining .18 billion to reach the .30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for his striking advertising campaigns, is planning to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing in order to achieve its resolution.
Northern Rock Bank this week called the offer of the Virgin consortium, which consists of three other companies, the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged construction corruption
In the early hours of this morning, the Civil Guard detained the current mayor of Totana (the People’s Party) over his alleged involvement in the construction corruption practices that were revealed earlier this week.
One of the town hall's secretaries and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales in May this year, the current People's MP and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER television, may have been the 'head' of the entire enterprise.
Police officers continue to monitor the city hall buildings and the construction commission, and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, a lawyer for Juan Morales, the main suspect in construction corruption, was charged earlier this week.
As reported yesterday by Caden SER, a lawyer for the 'people's' MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, they were arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the investigation sources, Morales is being investigated for allegedly collecting commissions for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that has reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono has accepted an offer to lead the Toledo-based PSOE and, if they win, to preside over Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) list in Toledo at the next general election and become President of the Congress if the Socialists win the general election.
This was announced by the PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself at a press conference following a meeting with Zapatero at noon today at the party's federal headquarters.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who on November 15 published his decision not to run in the next general election and to leave his active political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the top policy he had left two years ago.
He went on to say that just as citizens know who will be the deputy minister of the economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who would chair the Congress.
If Bono gets the job, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not of swearing or shouting" and achieve that it "will increasingly resemble citizens".
"Unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where it is impossible to speak calmly and peacefully is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate was interrupted 26 times on one occasion".
Similarly, he said laudable words to the current president Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place yet, so as not to stoop to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate Propaganda
As the climate change movement subjects both those who view its predictions skeptically and those who prefer other political and social struggles to ruthless persecution, it must show firm cohesion.
In addition, the leader of a movement that is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's actions or inaction have contributed significantly to Spain's leading the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spanish people what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay for saving the planet.
But we have not seen such explanations, nor will we see them.
This is because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centime of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapatero in terms of elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t cost anything, by pure propaganda, by slogans devoid of any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not blame, does not demand anything, but is an ornament of meetings and arouses tenderness.
If it's limited to being a virtual contracting party and not asking us to ride a bike and cool off with a fan.
Mayor and Chief of Local Police Totany Detained on Suspected Corrupt Construction Practices
According to sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, a “people’s leader” José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, a city hall secretary and a businessman in the hospitality business, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, where he is now located along with a number of police officers who also came to the Commission for Construction and the Municipal Enterprise for the management of industrial land and apartments.
The three arrests added to the six that occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving retraining more than 2 million hectares of farmland into land suitable for development, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the previous term, could build 4,000 houses there.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged in summary proceedings in the Totana City Court of First Instance.
The first six arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana today, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were also charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Province of Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribes were passed.
The investigation is being carried out by a group for crimes in the construction of the Civil Guard’s operational central unit, whose members, in addition to arrests, have also conducted eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area of a very well-known poultry meat company owner who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with building the largest residential complex of the Murcian city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the settlement of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of Corunna, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s issue of the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn’s book also happened to appear there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The killer of the victims, a high school student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the Education Councillor in charge of the subject of philosophy, demanded on the Helsingin Sanomat website that professors take a critical position on Plato, arguing that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory elementary course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague reports on the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime with a rate ranging from six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you sell less than 400 euros in the store, it is considered a mere offense (Section 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1000 euros in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (Section 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than the exchange of compacts.
Participation in the riot has a rate from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punished more than the provision of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's hand got cut off, and that's a good one.

My attending physician shoves me one of his articles on strange research titled "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
In other words, the feelings that the monthly paycheck evokes for employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and group leader of the Life&Brain Institute’s Neurocognition Project in Germany: “The greatest activation occurred when a research participant reacted correctly and his colleague misbehaved.”
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was moderate, but when one received double, the activation was higher.
I really don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has relentlessly pursued Balkan war criminals from the prosecutor’s office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the massacre in Srebrenica, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the title of the documentary film by the Swiss director Marcel Schoepbach "Karlin list" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in the pursuit of fugitive criminals and the pressure on the relevant states to pull the net.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a considerable expense, which depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driver's license, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive an agreed insurance amount in return for taking charge of the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
Insurance premium is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, status, gender, length of possession of a driver's license, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the greater the likelihood of a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their prudence.
In the same way, insurance companies found that married people had fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of it having an accident.
Increasing the frequency of rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the premium price.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best suits his profile of the insured.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of the insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face a variety of disadvantages, such as little driving experience and a short driving license when they want to negotiate premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks at a premium discount so as to get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's complicity in the payment of the insurance event.
"The amount of the insurance claim payment provided by the client will be pre-determined when determining the premium price, which will be the higher the lower the deductible would be," explains Luis Noguera, chief executive of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants of the operation so that the client insures against damage caused to other people, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendation.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid crashes as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
Malus, on the other hand, is an increase in the above-mentioned basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After crossing the twenty-five-year limit, drivers have it easier when they go to arrange insurance, as the client's risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks at a discount.
“Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance when an accident occurs, nor when driving,” assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the “newcomer’s fear” has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies as the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other road users, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to take out insurance against all risks at a premium discount (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us best in relation to our personal situation.
Celtic try to get to AC Milan point, which means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will face off this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an attempt to score the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the conclusion of the "Champions" league, as for the Italians it would mean being first and for the Scots it would decide the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a fifth-match draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but need one more to make sure he doesn’t get ahead of Shakhtar with six points, who will play Benfica, who has four.
The two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will first enter the thirteenth in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to compete for the victory, because the Italians will not want to tactics on home soil and Celtic knows that after the win he would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if he doesn't win, but he can't count on that, because at the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first straight match (2:0).
And so, AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe they will make it to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League for the second time just as they beat them in the same match in the previous competition with a goal of Kaka in overtime (1:0) after 0:0 in the regular season.
The hope that the "rossoners" will win will be Shakhtar, for whom he is worth winning if Celtic loses, both for advancing to the eight-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being the last and not having the opportunity to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with one win, so she would play in UEFA.
The Spice Girls first concert was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 viewers since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver have stated that the reunion of their group is a "sk".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video that recounted the group's history, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as their new album, which is released in Spain by EMI, and which brings a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, even though nervous Victoria had banned him from doing so a few days ago.
Prior to the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that he "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the show".
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to our differences" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness during a meeting with journalists two hours before the beginning of the performance.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made up my mind," Chisholm said of the reunion of the group, which she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
At the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with a Virgin Airlines special.
An army of nannies was waiting for them at the airport.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the price of natural gas, which increases the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas to Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a crushing drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large part of them remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom replenishes its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS ‘must control foreign workers’
The inspector said the Scottish NHS Chambers must improve criminal record checks on non-European workers.
A recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors to appear in the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being linked to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign personnel for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for criminal record checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside of the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commissions should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with inspections in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not performed on a regular basis," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS agrees in many ways with its own pre-employment screening policy, but also added: "Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who could commit an act of terrorism in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office warned that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had trouble identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that established control procedures at the NHS authorities in the Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian areas are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits, and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to get this job done immediately after the terror attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the Health Commissions, will consider the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices appear in updated pre-employment screening guidelines for all staff - including foreign staff - that it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biographical film about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has garnered five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Picture award.
The awards also went to Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes on the Scandal.

This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie, and New Order - cost just 3 million pounds.
But he won Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic U2 album cover Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film by Julien Temple about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won Best Actor for his role as the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s London thriller Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another Indiana Jones film, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he is proud of this award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 for terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia said yesterday it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an imminent attack on oil facilities as well as spiritual and security forces.
The state's largest oil exporter said one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since 2003, that is, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a stranger was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to defend the facility from al-Qaeda's failed attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal ministry statement: 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile launcher expert" that slipped into the country.
She also said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were to prepare for the murders of clerical and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and a US-backed Shiite government that conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support a royal family that controls the government.
Supported by calls from al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government, the militants targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past ... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Takfiri thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into the future of Earth
Yesterday, scientists announced that Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more similar to Earth’s headstrong twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago there were conditions on Venus similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the runaway greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower rotational speed have sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for one year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the University of Oxford's Department of Physics and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: "It's becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to build a scenario in which Venus began, like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police arrest 'enriched uranium'
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to the video and passed them on to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday November 28 were as comical as a snowman asking Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the Republican Party's status toward next year's election.
It is not clear exactly how CNN's producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most important Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the reel when they heard something gratifying: the announcer recorded peaks of approval as the candidates spoke of a hard-line approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who poked his way ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake up the reputation of a man who has been soft on illegal immigrants as mayor of New York City.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two wrestled particularly hard when interviewers asked if either candidate would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Secondary candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two stand a chance of being nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps because they began to sound the alarm over immigration earlier and more strongly than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same view: more austerity at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the rift between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Even though the Bible is his favorite book, Giuliani may not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all odds in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning him a laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul's loud cheer at Wednesday's debate.
The two rebounded from the bottom, as the two wings of the party still could not agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the winning report of American greatness on the lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Labour Pains
Gordon Brown has once again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would do without it being discovered that some wealthy businessman had for four years disguised the ruling Labour Party's contributions of 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) under other people's names, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted the British intelligentsia by claiming that the decision was not influenced by polls, there was hope that he would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly witty deputy chairman of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of the troubled bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative mischief.
A trio of retired generals launched a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested cuts in military spending as they argued that being a commander of the armed forces was a part-time job.
Now there are multifaceted gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irresistibly heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the tipping point behind which they find governance difficult.
The people don't trust politicians and they don't like them, but they usually put their mistrust aside when a new group takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not even be in office for long, this push is gone: state administration is becoming leaky, ministers are starting to brief, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one respect, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new broomstick compared to other political leaders.
However much he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the Northern Rock issues and the Treasury records are linked to the decisions that Mr. Brown made as Treasury Secretary.
And even though he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s troubles, such as a lengthy investigation into political party funding caused by “values for money,” voters can safely conclude that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
Those mistakes aren't as bad as the conservatives make them.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was outright deceived.
And the cure, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and lightly brutal government.
The recent commotion over political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he wished no publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not his.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abrahams's procedure but did not know it was illegal, will certainly be questioned thoroughly; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour money-gatherer, who learned of the tricky donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved in any way; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these schemes, though the bulk of the payments did not take place until after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but diluted his resolve by resorting to a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led in addition by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and move forward with a real reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour, who are in a tight spot, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the trade unions - the bitter pill for a dedicated party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to carve out victory is with unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card Sharks
Does the subprime mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally begin to flutter excitedly around.
As the U.S. real estate market dwindles, predators have turned their attention to the credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if subprime mortgages become infected.
Signs of tension are obvious.
There is an increasing number of cases of default (with more than 30 days of delay in payment) and written off accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
Last month, HSBC said it had lost $1.4 billion in U.S. consumer credit, also due to insolvent credit card loans.
However, it is still too early to panic.
Depreciation and inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody’s, the third quarter’s insolvencies rate was almost a full percentage point below average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
A change in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which make up a large part of credit card losses; thus, the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers had deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And confidence in the securities of secured credit cards is firm, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts that emissions will be 25% higher in 2007 than last year.
There are certainly direct routes for spreading the infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when property equity loans dry up, consumers are more likely to go into debt over credit cards.
However, credit card issuers look at the cash flow rather than the value of collateral items, so falling home prices don’t necessarily mean a change in lenders’ credibility.
They can even be beneficial for lenders.
The incentive for consumers to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up the list of priorities to be repaid.
Card issuers are also able to respond more quickly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid change in the prices of guaranty items.
“It’s not like we’re just going to reassess all our loans one fine morning,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Even if the risk of explosion in the style of subprime mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is much more real.
If lower house prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
UK bankers plead guilty in Enron case
The three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in a fraud linked to former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, changed their statement on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were initially guilty of seven counts of fraud in which they, along with Fastow, were involved in financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to appear in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been on the front pages for two years, which has taken the publishing proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the unsolved parts of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The indictment against bankers -- who have earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to frame the fraud along with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in an Enron affiliate controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of many of the Enron scams that pushed Enron spiraling toward bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch zero, but our three Britons knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
The incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in the Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But the $20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers received $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were free on a $1 million bond that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks made it impossible to hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's downfall.
Skilling is serving a 24-year sentence.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were expunged after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for a nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of Russia’s rich, however, it’s a small amount to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a tight family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Show, a four-day orgy of flamboyant consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping to lure the newly wealthy Russians into everything from mahogany-laden yachts to diamond-decorated car partitions that not even 50 Cent would be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next booth.
"It's a nice car, but against us it's dime and dime," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
On the waves of oil, money is pouring into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had its days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became hugely wealthy and went to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH Group, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes, Russia has 53 billionaires with a combined net worth of $282 billion.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, whose wealth totals 670 billion dollars.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are finely groomed, and men are every man for a fortune."
When they walked through the halls in their evening dresses on Sunday evening, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five years older Svetlana Turovcova described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who was wrapped up in designer clothing like a red carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a home hanger.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at fresh rich people, brand-controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit out for a few hours in the road traffic so that they can walk around the warehouse, which gaudyly stirs Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, M-venpick ice cream, tailor-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai, plush Gund draughts and draughts.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stall of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting of a hand-painted blue tile in extra-life size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in tinsel."
And indeed, local sellers say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known limited-edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
Some of them were shopping.
The first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two silk, cashmere and cotton mattress sets, interwoven with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he sold three chains for a $55,000 Rolls-Royce Phantom.
He showed a reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner that had a string coated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"That Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconia, he doesn't have to ride those wheels yet," Mr. Karapetian said.
"He puts them in his garage with thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not currently mean anything very exclusive, due to the large increase in the prices of local real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at a stand operated by the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company erected four red British-style telephone booths stuffed with a column of counterfeit notes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires’ Fair.
The passers-by stopped to throw around piles of money, or let friends take pictures of them resting in the middle of a substitute fortune, or simply stuffed their pocket a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Deaths in New Jersey May Have Been Caused by Defective Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant a little healthier and watched the ambulance arrive at a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police patrol car joined in.
And then another.
"Then I saw the delivery of the medical examiner arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newar Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness to the Newar police leadership.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard," Mr McCarthy said of Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
She was my shield.
It would protect me."
Mr McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the Union District Attorney, Theodor J. Romankowa, said detectives were trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo had died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m.
And they found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities still have little to say about their investigation or the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities interviewed Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a surgery.
Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a damaged rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door leading to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics - was enthroned in the open garage.
Two mountain bikes hung on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York City Police Department, Miss Arroyo provided invaluable assistance in biting through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful with this one or this one,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm borrowing conditions by further cutting interest rates were bolstered by reassuring remarks by the vice-chairman of the US central bank.
The stock markets surged in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second behind Ben Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman, said that in responding to continued pressure in financial markets, executives must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an apparent effort to calm the irritable markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crunch, Mr Kohn said the recent outbursts had "partly reversed some of the improvements in the functioning of the markets in late September and October".
He also said that if the increased instability persists, the possibility that financial conditions for households and businesses will deteriorate further will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital to the U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, as apartment sales in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of a cost-cutting effort to compensate for heavy losses caused by a failed bid to provide sub-prime housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than 39 billion pounds.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets showed themselves to be in full force after these funds were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7% in the auction of the European Central Bank’s three-month money packages, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release extra money into London’s money markets has increased, with the rates of the three-month British interbank loans “Libor” rising after uninterrupted growth since November 12 to their maximum since the end of September - 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
There are two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the select committee who holds the position at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, making the decision to help, and because Hugh Morris, the head manager of the English team, is beginning to fill the table with applications for the position of national selector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
He who is not placed sixth on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult and requires judgement, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if it is?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and insight in the field, should be promoted to the commission - there is only room for one.
Who's to say which level is right for a cricketer if he can't get a chance to drop or sail to the next one?
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, the cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right moment, whether to take a wicket, and the batsman needs regular chances at starting positions, if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching a collector's eye is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better ones that James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class in 33 runs for each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at the same mediocre average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for more.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may start or finish the career of both, or it may not have much influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every Test and gave good performances in the first class, five wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time was fighting for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who, in addition, despite having scored twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia, may still be underestimated.
Graveney, Vaughan and Moores are more likely to follow their conservative instincts after one more discussion following today's practice at Asirgiya Stadium, preferring Shah's greater experience over Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 in first class versus six Boparov, who is, at twenty-two, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah made only ten runs in two innings in May against the Caribbean in Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, and this, along with an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan wanted to re-cast him for another match, his batting seems to have taken away something of the vigor that was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex universal has joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket field, and his off-field behavior symbolizes a recently overturned four-wheel-drive car at the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He survived with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he pulled out was his Vodafone (and of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from a distance, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed skid pitches on local pitches, which seem to suit him, he gives out effectively and bats confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of choice.
Personally, I am in favour of Bopara getting his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he will be the one to play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, dumping refugees who had run out of money or expired visas, and others hoping the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the gunmen who had driven them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already packed with refugees from Syria and Jordan before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy, returning by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to cease fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariya called him, saying that the local militia, with the support of the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaida out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“A few friends called me last night and told me that he was running a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many spoke of the appeal of appeasement in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of biased citizens" who, with weapons in hand alongside the U.S. military, defend their neighborhoods.
But more was said to have been caused by visa filibusters and a drop in cash in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among the refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis so they would have to go back to Iraq," he said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of the violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state of Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
Only in one area of education does the Saar worry about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To the man who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest federal state.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which is ranked fifth in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Traditionally, universities have worked closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbruecken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even a triple diploma.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saar children are admitted to university - many of them even without studying at the gymnasium.
“In Saarland, the professional education system is used,” says Axel Pl’nnecke, an IW education expert.
By giving more than one in five young people the right to study at a vocational school, the Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland has a wealth of opportunities for combining practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two fields of study are second best in all of Germany in terms of population.
Despite a practice-oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saar Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotion campaign for engineering disciplines.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that is also adopted by other federal states.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
When the Pisa study was carried out in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29 to 20 %.
In general, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
Bastards are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of the Saar, the Pisa study does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Saarland could score just in this area.
The language of the neighbours is obligatory in the gymnasiums - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
Soon, the clock will go differently in Venezuela than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will allow the clock to be pushed back half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figurehead.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours under the new law compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by forcing the division of time zones around the world for hours.
On Wednesday, Chavez announced that he was severing ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist has stated that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
“I can’t because of my self-respect anymore,” said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the country’s citizens must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of hostages.
Uribe "split in the face" with his decision of Venezuela, criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile ringtone has caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet anymore?) - a sentence that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was voiced by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was so upset at the recent Ibero-American summit by the loud remarks of this left-wing populist that he silenced him in this way.
German workers at risk of lower pay in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages despite a strong boom.
The experts justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Bueckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower salary than last year.
“The blame lies with a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncturforschung (IMK).
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbräck told the Neue Osnabräcker Zeitung newspaper that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% was right and reasonable in this situation.
The Federal Employment Agency, however, would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspaper quoted this social democratic politician as saying.
On Tuesday, it was reported that a price explosion in food and oil products drove inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by three percent overall.
Venus is Earth's Hell Twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought. The European Venus Express spacecraft on Venus recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortexes at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is a flash of lightning.
Now, the European Venus Express spacecraft has brought proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flashes from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the well-known theory of the formation of primordial matter, lightning could have created life on Earth. The storms reportedly provoked reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
On Venus, it wasn’t: “If life ever existed there, it must have been a very long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but he's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the Ace mission.
Since no spacecraft has been sent to study Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to the researchers, the latest results of the study, which was published in several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought," said Esa.
In addition to the already known wind vortexes at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km is almost the same size.
This planet, known as the Morning Star or Evening Star, orbits the Sun in nearly 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble Earth at a surface temperature of 460°C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water has accumulated on both of them, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Kuehler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Germany's president has called for an end to party disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Germany’s President Horst Kuehler is worried about Germany’s reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the feud over the Dalai Lama’s admission.
"We shouldn't present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Kuehler told the Handelsblatt economic newspaper.
He also expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," said Kuhler.
Although the German president stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China also knows this," said Kuhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the Dalai Lama's admission, and was attacked by the coalition because of this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "pretentious" foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the chancellorship office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck (SPD), but it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL magazine.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also located in China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France
Street battles with the police, gunfights, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not escalate into street violence.
German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany after serious riots among young people in France.
“We must be careful not to create social tensions that erupt in violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about migrant integration.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we are seeing our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs were not comparable to those of the French.
In recent nights, juveniles and police have engaged in heavy street fighting in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
The greater integration efforts of the German government were demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of an "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average".
First of all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We must give youth hope."
But the head of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many migrant youths do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
He said, “But we have to be careful.”
We need to "quickly allow young people to start working and educating themselves."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burned trash cans and cars.
As of yesterday, approximately 1,000 law enforcement forces are taking care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse rioted.
Sunday’s crash resulted in the deaths of two young people.
According to the initial findings of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of minors.
In the realm of Angela "Clouds"
The chancellor’s distant output documents that the coalition is at the end of the program and that we can’t expect anything more from it either.
In which country does the Chancellor live?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Bundestag, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, administer.
To the reproach that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once responded with a very arrogant sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, showing she didn’t want to understand what the critics were up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved this reproach.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblakova" presented herself: a politician who stands out above others, who flees into foreign policy and even there speaks only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
By the way, such self-praise - so much immodesty would have been forgiven by the CDU chair two years ago.
Now she limits herself to idle phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, she harms her image as a pragmatist who does not need to be flattered because she solves problems.
But in Angela's realm of "Clouds," internal political problems are a fringe issue.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few minor points left on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel speaks when it comes to child benefits.
Three times, Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to be able to say at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things become too specific, it stumbles as if in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate over Republican presidential candidates on YouTube has sparked a heated debate over favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident on the first issue.
Mitt Romney accuses his rival, Rudy Guiliani, of making New York “a haven for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani quickly reacts with sharp regrets: “I believe that his own house was just one such refuge,” he replies, throwing to the former Massachusetts governor that he privately employed undocumented immigrants.
Since the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos shot by Internet users and sent via Youtube serve only as such help for the key topic.
“It is precisely through this policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power,” McCain told his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one who is pushing for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain does not spare Romney his remorse for refusing to denounce the torture method of questioning called "Waterboarding", in which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are important topics of the campaign.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
This shows where the weaknesses of the two are.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney contritely explains, asking the party’s base and television audience to forgive him for being an advocate of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civilian life for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Parviz Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place in the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and pursue the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as commander-in-chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, subject to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, a former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the West’s demands.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf has seized favored lawyers after declaring a state of emergency in early November, overturned all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area, and four others were wounded.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock Fathers are back
The famous German group of the seventies plays again. Three members of the Harmonia group took up their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already well-known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists of the appearance of three sedentary gentlemen, who initially look as if they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and mainly buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
To his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
The 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focusing on the synthesizers, is on the right from the point of view of the audience.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, inadvertently, they form a traditional composition.
It doesn’t seem to matter much to the musicians.
The revival of the band Harmonia caused quite a stir among krautrock lovers.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not so familiar that this band has been painfully missed for twenty-three years.
But why couldn’t even a German celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when they value the style of music, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in their own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne band Can the Echo Prize for their life’s work, the hall was full of enquiring views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Dusseldorf and Neu! during their speech, the astonishment of the audience no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoring abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloads the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time did not have the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of Berlin's Schaubuehne Theatre.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, at a phonograph company run by the church.
Rother briefly worked with Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the band's musicians into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
It was rather a life in such a Spitzweg artistic being.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir, whose badge was reportedly found in a trash can.
A lot of that harmonies.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following was "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting rosacea was not just about self-knowledge.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was reportedly cut during a concert in Griessem in front of a record small, barely fifty-member set.
At that time, Rothera expressed his wish that the members of the Harmonie would avoid each other and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebio, it was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
The band Cluster came to life again in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful for the live album from Griessemer.
His record company, Grunland, set out to preserve krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedel's solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be a Briton, Julian Cope, an old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
In this way, we have outlined the overall impact of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "Unique true music, the future belongs to it."
There are paintings on which the producer is with Harmony in the peasant's seat.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photos, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
No longer sticking microphones on the organ and drums to get out of the instruments those never before heard self-made tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-savvy pundits.
Not even the House of World Cultures has changed that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place she emphatically sings "Aaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Rather than in the blues, we would find roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escaping from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not let himself be disturbed even now.
Even the most obvious things are thought through on the stage.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question either deprives a person of his nerves or allows him to experience ephemeral moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
Two films about the war in the Balkans appeared with the introduction of the films The Hunting Party and Morderischer Frieden.
But neither of them is convincing.
The artwork of the films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can't stop that from happening in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: Karadzic and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the eighties, not only because he played in many charming, non-serious roles in relaxed women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences eternally on the topic of Buddhism, one will be deprived of the appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes the Huntsman (Why do movie titles have to be so long and tangled nowadays?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially what Gere could have become if fate and the film business had not been so merciful: a man who, while having had his best years long gone, still retains a certain remarkable charm as a ruinous monument.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film, also entering cinemas this week, is just the continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
We can do a short process with the film M?rderischer Frieden: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovar sniper, after which one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not represented as the cause of all evil here, this television shallow film turns too soon into shooting and action.
The movie will be similar to Cobra 11, without the highway, but with the war.
In The Hunting Party, you can clearly explore why a really good film has not been made about the Balkan War so far.
The story of three American war reporters who go after the "fox", Serbia's top war criminal, could at a different time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here is both Richard Shepard) perhaps become the new "Apocalypse".
The two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes a road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced in the beginning.
On the contrary, the original will also prescribe him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
We can finally write off The Hunting Party after the reporters did what NATO, the CIA, and all the world’s criminals have failed to do in the last five fast-paced minutes of the film: catch the criminals and leave them to avenge the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court in The Hague.
The film has a deeply human message.
It condemns Karadzic and Mladic as still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not pursue persecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar, we think of Brecht’s famous poem.
In it, it is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the oncoming veins on my forehead, noting: how laborious it is to be evil.".
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are exactly such swollen heads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big failures.
There has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always: When a star wanders through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film is made like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Frontier of Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films apparently have to mature - films that today are considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "The Lead Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers don’t have the ability to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" had become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe they have to form a sarcastic artistic perspective like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprior's Dictionary" and the "Balkan War", he stated: "The resemblance lies only in the fact that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, the people will always be murdered in a terrible way and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust has been criticized for refusing to host the Olympics.
The mayor's resignation from hosting the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has been met with fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in estimating chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jorg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision "unfortunate from a business point of view" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sports-political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on an altered timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic bid," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
“For us, this preference means that we have no realistic chance with a 2028 timetable.”
Yet this dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's remarks regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to bid for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to destroy our chance by marking the plans as buried at this early stage," said HSB President Gunter Ploss on Wednesday.
To refuse to apply would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he made at the General Meeting of the German Higher Education Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiade as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
Last week, the Hamburg University Sports Association nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg parliament of the Senate has accused it of wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on hosting the Olympics and excluded the construction of flats," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD was still planning the Olympics for the Klein Grasbrook area, with the whole area later to be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Applying for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg was wrecked in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who combines the words Sweden and wooden crates does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Do you?
Wooden crates currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of his listed ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" of 1968, comes an internal research of the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm with the result that brought disillusionment; six "Brillo boxes", which in 1995 the Museum Moderna Museet donated to its former director Pontus Hultillo, are copies - like most of the other boxes on the international market "B.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden crates that were based on the red-and-white design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their originals, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, but they are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of the fifteen crates that rightfully entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred crates were made and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 of Hultén's crates were made in Malmo for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol was already three years dead.
In addition to the six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, Lars Bystrom, the head conservator of the Moderna Museet, also examined three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and, after their plywood plates were painted with the base paint and sanded, were painted with oil white paint with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies showed that the paint was applied directly to the plywood plate without the previous primer - besides, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list," said Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board organization in New York City does not come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into these "core allegations" that have been made about soap powder boxes.
But the organization remains in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had fortified themselves in a hotel in Manila demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the carnage.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood trial over a thwarted coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to be guarding him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government loyalists have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
“We encourage people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other troops would join the march shortly.
Critics of the government called for a large demonstration to be held against the president on Friday.
Her government has been accused of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district had already become the main site of a revolt of about 200 troops against Arroyo in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the insurgents, the revolt failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines has attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government at least seven times.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than a 20% stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
Previously, there was speculation of taking over.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its share in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After the bank Berenberg increased its stake in the company of this D-sseldorf network operator by another 5% to 15.1%, there were speculations about entry on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold another 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesman for United Internet explained.
In order to take over the rival Freenet, the companies jointly set up an MSP joint venture.
United Internet said on Thursday that the two companies would settle for more than a 10% stake in Freenet for the time being and would not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49% of the company.
For the time being, it is considered that the companies are keeping all options open, especially the possibility of further increasing their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet over the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This long-running and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million complete or DSL customers.
Holding United Internet and Drillische so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will gain an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
