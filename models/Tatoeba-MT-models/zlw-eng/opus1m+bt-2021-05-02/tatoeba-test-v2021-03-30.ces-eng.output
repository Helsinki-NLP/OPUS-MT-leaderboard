I've been satisfied with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting, even when they asked me out.
Are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to get out to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for him.
Tom's obviously lying.
So straight up and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

Playing a game isn't easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is Russia's capital.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer with us.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
The ancient customs are dying quickly today.
Tom's still busy.
You better get out now.
Tom's childless.
I like reading.
We cut the rope.
I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train must have stopped because there was a fallen tree lying on the tracks.
What did Tom scream at the crowd?
He's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes from the 17th century.
Are you happy with your body?

He went to a tree with great effort.
Translation of the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing there, too.

It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We've been complaining about the manager's noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills are qualified for the job.

Open your eyes.

Are you going to school by train?
Tom's not going to be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's okay, Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer this question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It doesn't surprise me when it happens.
He's single.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his legs carefully.
Did you eat this morning?
John was happy as a spy when she got a record contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this thing if you helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
She'll visit her uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.

I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary tennis last night.
What's your dad's name?
There were half-cracked walls here.
I spoke English with him and found out that I could make a deal.
Tom must have been running.
I see a book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshened.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer me questions.
They'd all be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about divorceing her.
I bought one bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There were absolutely no doubts.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
Once we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laughter attack.
Tom's wrong, right?
Better dead than living red.

I'm still eating.
The horse is bitter.
I lent Tom the comb.
I'm boring.
I write my will.

I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll have something to drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I better get back inside.
She doesn't have to do that.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.

Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like german movies.
This works.
Let go of the swing.

I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
It's down, it's easy to lose.
Do you remember seeing me?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If it weren't for her help, I'd never take the test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
