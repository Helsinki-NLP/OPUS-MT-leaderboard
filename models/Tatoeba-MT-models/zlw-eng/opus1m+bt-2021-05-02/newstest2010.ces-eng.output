Barack Obama gets the fourth American president of Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive at the Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over Nobel Prize of Peace here as the fourth American president in history.
The money, medals and check for 1.4 million dollars will, among other things, receive exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
Chief of White House will arrive at the Norwegian capital in the morning with Michelle's wife, and he'll be busy.
First, he will call the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee that selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
Then this afternoon, the visit will highlight the ceremony that Obama will take over the prestigious award.
He will receive it as the fourth American president, but only the third one who will receive the prize directly at the office.
The White House has already noticed that Obama will speak of the Afghan War during the acceptance of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that the price is being taken as a president currently fighting in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago has increased by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of his criticisms.
Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for the ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to put on charity, but you haven't decided on a particular charity yet.
The charged program will then lead the president to the banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and the other 250 invited guests will also be.
Obama has been more and more sustainable since the beginning of the price.
He showed, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it was not only a prize for him, but for all who sought the same values as him.
Immediately after the notification, he stated that he was a ‘quiet to an event’ for him,
Protector of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřický P.D. accused the president of the Civil Society of Protectors of Nature Litoměřice from blackmail.
In several cases in the past year he appealed to some building management, for the withdrawal of the appeal he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Litomological police spokesperson Alena Romová.
The President of the Litomometer Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studička.
He's in custody now and he's in prison for up to three years.
Working containers of Brno not smelling too much
In Prague, ordinary people can sorting containers from drinks, in the south Moravian villages you will meet the sorting containers at every step.
And Brno?
There to win a few minutes before you find the right ashtray.
I don't want to say that there's no such thing as a waste in Brno.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the councillors are very concerned about this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only because as citizens, we can still throw paper, glass and plastic into the sorting containers, but above all the number of ash for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw PET bottles in a collection basket in the center?
He's a finished friend, especially he wants time and hard nerve.
The only place I've hit so far is on the Moravian Square across from the Miss Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onder and his colleagues get mad at me, but it seems so damn little to me.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of waste.
A lot of my friends don't want to make this go away.
From the lesion.
It's a long way to the ashtray.
I don't blame them.
I offered myself after the party to fire some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any color bins on Kounic Street.
Fortunately, I ran into the railing at the right place.
However, the wastes overflowed it.
It's still the center of Brno that the city most represents, isn't it?
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't care much about Brno socialists.
The city prefers to buy hockey extralig that makes us shame throughout the Republic before buying some extra containers and offering sorting of other ingredients for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad that I could confirm official statistics after a moment of entry on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM data, there is really the worst of all the South Moravian region in Brno.
“Paroubk’s budget took the money for pensions and sickness
After she added her left in spite of the government's opinion to farmers or officials, there may not be money for pensions, sickness or construction savings in the budget.
But also interest in government debt or international court disputes.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social Democrats and communists promoted some groups, they relied on the fact that the government would lend additional money to sensitive expenses, pensions or hospitals.
This is because they pay more and more interest in the money they borrow and they have to come back sometimes.
There's not much to choose where to take it.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced to the State’s progress, they must raise taxes.
All the left has now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And then their children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or hospitals whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion.
However, at the cost of becoming more debt, there will be only 163 billion missing in the cash register next year, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janoty, debt will continue to grow faster and with him also the interest costs.
The State will need money to pay it, and it will be no longer sufficient to increase VAT or reduce the motherly way the government did it in its anti-deficial package.
For the transfer of money to several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the construction of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the already disassembled and rebuilt sections that are redesigned and, where appropriate, not discounted.
At the very least, to book, which is not free.
This means the delay or halting of 30 large buildings, which are also at risk of drawing European money, warns the spokesperson of the Transport Department Karel Hanzelk.
The ČSSD suggested that the cost of money will be settled by Shalamunsky - it will reach the CEZ dividend, which the State will most of its own, and the transport fund will add.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never sure, and it is no longer a bottomless source.
Last year, it came from ČEZ to budget 18 billion.
Every year the dividend applies to the liquidation of environmental damage, the supplementary pension account or is used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, this trick under EU rules increases real budget deficits to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, this does not end with the penalty of movements.
Almost three billion were left in the budget for various compensation by the victims of communism and criminal acts or for the expenditure of court disputes, even for construction relief.
If it gets around without this money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing on the already developed two-million Treasury project, which is intended to allow online monitoring for what the individual authorities are spending on.
First stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, there will be sanctions, warning Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans will count on the mobile phone, on which the user will press one button to switch between different operating systems.
The exposed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android within seconds.
This is precisely what VMware aims to target the American company, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to keep two user profiles on your cell phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can split them into domestic and work.
Both will work at one and the same moment, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a sample of smartphones with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which also ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full flow.
The company VMware now cooperates with European and US operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and to customers the devices should be reached during 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains is suffering from hotels
Holy slopes don't just worry about the Krkonose skiers.
The missing snow reflects people from the order of ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains they can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a big visitor on our website.
People are going through offers, finding prices, but they are afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask us if this year's Christmas will be snow or snow,” said the information operator of Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
He who wants to stay in Špindler's Mille exactly according to his idea should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers money and accommodation quality at his place in the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler hotels so far offer only weekly stays at Silvestra.
I think they're going to try to put them down for a while, but then they're gonna let go and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will be quick to sleep,” said Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates are still available also by the vrchlabská travel agency Intours.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that's not sold out yet.
Even so, half the seats in our offer remain open.
That's why we had some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,” said director Intoursu Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonose can still offer the Warsaw travel agency, but the available places are less.
The first 14 days in February are well available, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interested in winter stays negatively influences the fact that there is no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People wait for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out.
On the contrary, a little better than last year are available to accommodate the rooms of the Horizon Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few seats for New Year's Eve.
He is very interested in Polish holidays in January and is well sold also February,” informed the director of the best Prague hotel Karel Council.
From 80 percent, the Omnia hotel is occupied with a central parking lot in Janské Lazne.
On the contrary, for Christmas, half of the beds are still available in the most recent Canadian hotel.
We were surprised this year by January, which is already occupied by about 60 percent of us.
It is a little weaker yet, but once the snow falls, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly still rise, said the director of the Hotel Omnia Erik Sporych.
However, the larger part of the snow has to be enjoyed by the Krkonoše hotels.
On Thursday, it's supposed to cool down if there's any precipitation, so there should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, he is to come up with warming, informed Jiří Jakub from the castle work of the Czech hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is Mother of wisdom
He's so comic, with what school effort Barack Obama, president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in Afghanistan, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally drank his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turns out he described it through a copycat from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the word turnover several times in the text itself - as in Iraq - but did not hesitate to even use the name of Bush’s statement from January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: ‘The new route forward’
He then criticized Bush’s idea three years ago to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq with a civil war as “unresponsibly and in his followers a catastrophic decision”
However, the following months have shown that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only possible and successful so much that they are not speaking today in the report on Iraq.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successors a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked by the Polish commander for the increase of the military contractor, especially the Chief Chief Chief of Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the sub-ordination habit of harshly criticized the massive shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he encircled the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to claim a promise of another 5,000, although he originally counted with at least 10.
The most challenging of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start bringing together troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and ending this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than providing answers.
Many doubt that the half-intendent increase will give the same fruit as the process in Iraq.
Despite the recent war, Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite sign - no one can rely on and no agreement is observed.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are used to change the master every day according to how appropriate they are.
Political institutions, even if they are formally founded, will remain just a gloomy village behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to rise.
Consideration of the interests of the various ethnic groups is extremely complex given the indifference of the ratios which are even more complex by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building a successful state, which is a minimal objective of the entire operation, does not seem too real.
The Obama Strategy Time horizon prevents its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it's on the edge of the explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to war’s ulcers for the purpose of “deep return home” - will cause a miracle made here, only souls can truly romantic, reality intact.
From a political point of view, the determination of the date of withdrawal of the troops is a pure irresponsibleness, as the Taliban will perceive it as indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in fighting operations in Afghanistan has gone to a minus.
Europe's politicians don't even want to explain to their voters how Germany or Italy's security is connected with the war in the Indian Mountains.
Another factor capable of radicalising the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the strengthened sanctions do not affect Iran, there will be an excessive question in front of the United States whether to try not to solve the military problem with force.
It will be possible to answer her when Obama believes that America will step up to the winning download from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnover in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections remain for three years, and therefore there is still plenty of time to come up with another strategy if this is shown to be a total fall.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer be paid in cash
Goldman Sachs' senior managers will not receive a cash reward this year.
She reported it to a company that responds to the sharp criticism of her mzd practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will get instead of the money of the stock that will be able to sell in the first five years.
In addition, shares can be taken away by managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is in the lead of a long-term remuneration link to Wall Street.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be issued, said the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Bank Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after the first three quarters of this year, she left almost $117 billion (about CZK 300 billion) for rewards.
According to Reuters, the total remuneration in the company this year is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of today's announced measure.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political topic in a number of countries.
In Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to charge 50 % of the bank's bonuses more than £ 25,000 (sum of CZK 712.000) one-off taxes.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The five record women today took over from the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
Next to four scientists among them, the German writer of Romanian origin was Herta Müller.
Nobel Prize for medicine was received by two American biografs Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider along with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosoms.
The prize for chemistry was given by Israel's Ada Jonah along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and functions of the ribosoms.
The latest winner was Nobel's award for the economy acquired by American Elinor Ostrom and her country's Oliver Williamson for analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that's been around this year without the holder was physics.
This award was taken today by scientists Charles Kao for research in optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital camera, fax or astronomical telescopes.
Every diploma, Nobel's medal, and a financial reward certificate.
Each category has a total of 10 million Swedish crowns ($25 million).
If they are named more in each one of them, they share the reward among themselves.
Traditionally the most expected Nobel Prize for peace received this afternoon in the Norwegian Oslo of the American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognised the controversialness of his appreciation, since he was only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of the country leading two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his politics, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to combat peace, even though the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the demiss. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will take on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janot, who is considering maintaining in the government, because he does not agree with the form of a state budget for the next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies at the Centre.
It is assumed that the budget and maybe Janot's maintenance in the cabin will be the themes of their Friday meeting.
The budget criticizes and Klaus.
According to him, he has too much deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
He informed the President's spokesperson Radim about the meeting.
He wants to deal with Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should host CZK 163 billion with a deficit.
However, in Wednesday, the House agreed to offer a left to move money and increased the money for public workers' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has paid attention to the social democracy proposals to the fact that they are secretly increasing the deficits of the budget.
Among the left-hand, Klaus and the right-wing, on the other hand, there was a sharp intra-political dispute which led to the question of the further effects of Fischer's sepulchre, where the formation of which was agreed by ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party on spring.
Critique claims that the budget, as the House has adopted, essentially destroys the package of austerity measures that Fischer’s government has put in place in the autumn and which it believes is intended to stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can sign the State Budget Act, but also does not have to sign today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs, stated that politicians for a longer period of time have neglected a serious problem - which is an unsustainable deficit - public finances.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
The improvement could only bring a strong government, which could, moreover, lean on the broader consensus of political parties, my president.
The President of ODS Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget was scary and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President ODS Petr Nečin said that the concept of an insurmountable cabin with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the greens is obviously not working anymore.
In response, the Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as \"serious statements.\"
Chief ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánka by saying that it was a terrible deficit of the budget that the former Topolánkov government prepared for this year and which exceeds CZK 200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, she identified the ČSSD of the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
Humans were also satisfied.
Mandelu played Morgan Freeman in the newspaper Clinton Eastwood.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The unsuspected world tells a lot about the country, its fight and victory despite some criticisms that the main roles are creating American actors.
The story tells us about sports, racial relations, and Nelson Mandel.
The tireless warrior against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life accounts represents the oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that one year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to access you.
The twenty-year-old actor, who won the prize for role in Eastwood's drama from the setting of the Million Dollar Baby box, has created, for example, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he finally became a slave, fictional president of the United States and even God in God's Evan, but only rarely someone who still lives and is so important to many people as Mandel.
Former South African State has been in prison for 27 years for his active work on the termination of Apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and then became President of the country for four years.
In 1993, Nobel Prize was awarded for peace.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and it is the name of poet William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Grogby team Francois Pienar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after the apartheid still racially and economically divided.
They believe that they can connect their people through sports, so they decide to unite the gamers, who are in a global scale between the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually proceed to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman's been working a few years to get Mandel's story on canvas.
I had no other objective than to play this role so that I could approach it as much reality as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind him before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found out that if I printed your hand, I took over your energy, transferred, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon is creating in the film François Pienaara, the captain of the National Grogby team in which white players thought.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in a tough world of ragby.
The great surprise for him was the first time he met Pienar in his house.
I remember calling the bell ring, he opened it to me, and the first thing I told François Pienar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual ancestors under the direction of director Eastwood gained Invictus: Undefeated positive reviews, and they are also talking about ambitions at Oscar.
Film critic Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his review into the words: “He was a very good story, a very well-made film”
In film reviews on the rottentoes.com website, Invictus gained 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway dissolved: the Russians tested the rocket
Over Norway, it was possible to observe the specific light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Department only admitted yesterday that there was a cross-continental ballistic missile testing near Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was once again failed and the shooting marked as the type of “Bulava”, which was supposed to be originally the boast of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence during rocket tests did not have a significant effect on the success of the testing flights.
The bull usually didn't fly or hurt in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, it is about “Bulavo,” it says of a“creature that doesn’t fly“
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This was already 13th try at first.
Until the end of the flight, the technical damage to the aparate occurred again.
Apparently, he blew up the engine at the third stage of the rocket.
This time “Bulava” started from the Atomic sub of Dmitri Doskij, which sailed under the White Sea.
This type of rocket makes it possible to fire off a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was actually broken -Bulava -
In the end, Norwegians have not doubted that this is a Russian rocket.
This time, the Generals defend themselves and claim that there is no clear need to speak about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket have lasted and the accident has hit three.
In the previous cases, motors went up first-degree.
Even though there was not a test start completely without errors, only six out of thirteen were not responsible.
Therefore, nearly 50 percent of the success of the generals is filled with optimisticism and so still claims that “Bulava” will fly without problems once and that it will even take up to 10 hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in the CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will be presented again in 51 years in professional hockey play.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner, and the holder of Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow in an emergency and will probably be in KHL Friday duel against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who completed his career in 40 years in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš got hurt, we really need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to get some formal details, quote the AP Coaches of the Moscow Club Sergey Nemčinova.
It's not clear yet whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only have one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift up the spirit of other players, he said German.
Fetisov, according to AP, will become the oldest professional hockey player in the event of a return to ice.
In the NHL, he played in the 21st century for Hartford entire season for the legendary Gordie Howe attacker and wrote 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful goods of history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven titles of world champion, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Champion.
In the second part of his career, he gathered successes in the NHL, where in Detroit's dressing twice picked up above Stanley Cup's head.
Since 2001, he's been a member of the hockey hall of fame.
Hyundai's acquitted the union, canceled all the overtime.
Hyundai's Nošovické car manager agreed to cancel all overtime with the union.
It's because of the often-ordered overtime, union reports on Monday's strike.
It was confirmed by a spokesperson named Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the union on one of the Saturday shifts this year.
We cannot resign to our production plan, which is essential, therefore it was proposed a voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December with two shifts made, said Vanek.
Server Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees working on the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
They get people back for working Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way the employees were motivated for their proposed overtime.
They either make a payment for overtime or they can choose a spare leave on December 28th, and thus by the fall of the day to extend Christmas holidays, said Vanek.
Besides, all Saturday shift employees get paid tickets and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and flammable point in terms of comments and complaints by union workers, as well as protesters, the industry stopped production last week, the management decided to immediately expire all the overtime for December last afternoon, Vaněk said.
The carers were forced to work on a two-hour overtime every day after eight-hour shifts until last week.
Following signature of the agreement, the station emergency department shall withdraw
Further negotiations between the car manager and the expert are due to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the department, Petr Kuchier, on Wednesday, said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign the common document, they are prepared to cancel strike emergency.
The situation in the car went up last week on Wednesday when about 400 employees spontaneously stopped because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management stated that the overtime had to be done to meet the requirements for car delivery.
Experts, in their Monday’s statement of strike emergency, also demanded that there be no sanctions against workers who have interrupted their production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay $5,000 for it this year.
Hundreds now employ 2,000 people.
The company's serial production broke up last November.
By this September, about 80,000 cars were produced, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works for HIV-used viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already obtained anti-Immunity drugs.
This fact, in some cases, outweighs the fact that compounds to normal variants of the virus do not act as strongly as some of the medicines available.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients may significantly prolong the life of a mixture of medicines that prevent the spread of HIV in their body.
However, their use carries on a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete inhibition of virus growth has resulted in the development of so-called resistent viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three Institutes of Sciences of the Czech Academy of Sciences, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called methalocarborane act on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarborates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all medicines used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come with the new “adjusted” compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links to the viral protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-cylinder cages formed by boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are connected with metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Black and durable virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV prosthesia caused by HIV fibrillation, mature viral particles would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we stop the virus from spreading in the patient's body, explain the scientists in the press report published by the Department of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically amended.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the test and also against its resistant (resistible) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on normal enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinical use drugs, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications so from metalocarborans makes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective medicines against HIV, says PavlínaŘezáčová, Head of the Structural biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight for the budget, the ODS went to Fischer's, it's being prevented.
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek named an approved budget for the next year for a \"swimming\" and the Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
ODS's statement was marked by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He's keeping time for analysis.
Vice-President ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of a department cabin with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Green Party is clearly not working anymore.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to refer to a minority in the Chamber that is dealing with a growing deficit or he is concerned with the continuation of his function with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issues of public deficits is diametrically different, pointed out Nečas.
On Wednesday, the House adopted its 2010 budget, but with cheap amendments for over CZK 12 billion.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of public workers, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The advantage of the government to the address of the social democracy proposals was that they secretly increase budget deficits.
The Czech Republic should host a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the hall before the vote, agreed that the government's desire for a revised budget was less wrong than the budgetary commission.
Disappointment and vanity
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke about disappointment and loss, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would still evaluate the situation.
The timing is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave the office in the event of an amendment, the situation could look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered the Prime Minister on Monday.
He pointed out that he considered further continuation in his function.
The reason for this is his disappointment from the budget negotiations.
If Fischer refers to another fight against the deficit of the budget, they do not, according to Nečas, in the government what to do with the CNBSD nominations, which the changes in the budget have been made.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will give demission if the House approves other laws of deficit increasing, such as those relating to sickness, pension, or amendment to the law of service.
Topolánek: ODS nomination ministers did not commit themselves
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the government.
The ODS nomination ministers did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in the US text report.
He reminded that in several ministrys there are people in the community's functions, who voted against the budget, who voted in favour of the TOP 09.
The time has pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the deficit of public finances, it is absolutely logical and correct that he is opposed to a left-wing majority, which is currently in the House.
He then said that he cannot count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it was up to date, I would like to take care of it, he told the journalists in the Chamber of Defense Minister Martin Barták, who had been nominated by civil Democrats in the government.
He left the Prime Minister Fischer this afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS resigned.
At the same time, it was pointed out that ODS would clearly vote against the revised budget in the middle of the House if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats did not explicitly request that the budget be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, then responded to the question whether ODS did not bother the President of the party in Parliament and the Czech Republic when negotiating the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Since I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months, it would be mainly about the Bolsheness of the House and the destruction of everything positive, he reacted to Topolánek himself.
According to the new ČD rule, less trains will be held for almost the same driving
Czech Railways since December 13, or limit some of the less burdened speeds and elbows, other connections will, on the contrary, be strengthened.
The overall range of transport shall be reduced from the date of the new timetable compared to today by two percent.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer driving, will not change.
More possibilities of connection to the capital will be obtained, for example, by the residents of Ostrava, by adding one set of pendolino on this track.
On the contrary, the speed train will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less speeds will also take place on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, in principle the direct connection Prague - Letohrad will be limited.
The regions plan the largest reduction in transport in the Králéhradke Region, a total of eight percent, on the other hand, it may enjoy Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budejovice and the operation of several speeds on the line Praha - Písek - České Budejovice is limited to only some days a week.
The most recent changes include the introduction of new direct lines from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovics must transfer to Lysé nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electricity line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will be completed at the Prague Main Station.
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prahou and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jesník at two hours intervals.
Pendoline to Bratislava since 13 December, passengers will no longer drive.
Annual account for regional railways: 200 million more
The speeds will be ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, total to pay the so-called proven losses will give the road to the next year four billion crowns as well as this year. Locals order countries, total pay eight billion crowns for them next year, while the state will contribute to less than three billion countries.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
They have a newly concluded 10-year contract on the elbows and shafts, so far the contract has always been signed for one year.
The drugs are commending the system, and it is probably not possible to increase prices for the vast majority of tickets.
Only one day network tickets of ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets will be changed.
For passengers with no customer card, the price of ČD Net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLišky will rewind from the distance of a given, until now it has been uniform for the journey between any country cities.
The Philippine Armed Forces are still holding over 50 people, children are free.
At the south of the Philippines today, 75 people, including several students of primary school and their teachers, were kidnapped.
This was introduced by AFP, which originally only informed about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 held children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in Agusan del Sur Province.
Approximately 19 gunmen say he uses hostages as a live shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police originally persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence that requested the execution of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a recent massacre of 57 people was declared a state law.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the massacre on 23 November.
In view of the suspicions of participation in the massacre, the governor of this Southfilipine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the powerful family of Ampatuan was arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists on the island of Mindanao.
But they renewed peace talks with the Philippines government on Tuesday.
The JAR story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days comes to American cinemas the new Hollywood film Clinton Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-renowned fighter against apartheid was met by Morgan Freeman, who said he chose Mandela himself for his formation years ago.
The leading male role of legendary South African champion in Francoise Pienaara was made up by Matt Damon.
By listing the film into the cinema, both the critics and the public stand out of the message
Nelson Mandela
The entire name of Nelson Rollahella Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa Mvez.
In 1988 Sacharov received the prize for freedom of thought, then in 1993, he and the de Klerek Nobel Prize of peace.
President of the South African Republic was in 1994-1999.
great expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in the South African Republic, however, the preparations for the world championship in football, while the media are shaking up the worrying reports of rising racial hatred and discrimination by the black government of the majority.
According to the intelligence agencies, the APs are positive for the new film in JAR, despite numerous reservations against the main roles of the Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of his words on a new film.
I've been dreaming about the role for years, and he's been getting ready for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times to - as it is said - to have exhausted his energy, in an interview after the official film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remind Mandel's personality and message through the film.
It is the story of the South African Republic, but it concerns every human being, added.
In the dressing of the national rugby team
The film based on the book presentation of British writer John Carlin with freely translated name In the role of enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African human rights advocate during its first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to stmilit two racials and, for a long time, a group of citizens, as well as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, also enters an acting role in South Africa’s national rugby dressing on the field of the world cup, which then JAR won.
For the entrance to the lawn in the dressing room, which is understood almost as something sacred, Mandela calmed down the great fruitage of the Belarusian audience 14 years ago and gained the recognition of the Belarusian population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people into one nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only national team in 1995.
If the situation in JAR improves, it'll only show up.
However, the white South Africans are sceptical as an example in a recent LN interview revealed a fan of Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Championship will begin on 11 June 2010.
There's a transformer burning in Lounsk for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was captured in the morning by Čeps transformer in divorce near the village of Vyškov in Lounsk.
For the fire, it interferes according to the spokesperson of the regional firefighters Luke Marvan, six units.
Originally, firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reevaluated the view and fire fire fires a mixture of water, foam and special fire substances.
The cause was a technical failure, an internal transformer shortfall.
No one was injured, according to Paul Mandát's spokesperson, does not threaten to operate the transmission system safely.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, the exact number will be achieved after the fire has ended.
Mandata's decommissioning transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years, the activities of Čeps have not happened, the failures of this type are unique, complete.
The supply of electric current was not interrupted by ČEZ spokesperson for North Bohemia Soni Holinger Hendrych, the operation of the household, office or company fire trafostnice did not influence.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps, restores and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformers switching electrical energy from transmission to transmission system and lines of lead length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will make a criminal statement for the talks on three Czech delegates from the USSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present a criminal notice for the talk of three socio-democratic flocks.
And it's on Michal Haška from South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubický Region and the captain of the Olomouc Region of Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said it in 20 minutes by RadioJournal.
The claim is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail transport in some countries.
All regions have finally signed long-term contracts with Czech roads.
All three flocks attack us and talk about choosing the event while we only offered an offer to what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech drugs that have been closed last week.
So we don't have a choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for talking to Student Agency, said RadioJurnel Jančura.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that they did not take action in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares an initiative for the European Commission.
The release of criminal notice is considered to be another continuation of the media show by Mr Jančura, which serves him as an unpaid advertising by his company and his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and my country, and to invite others to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, said Hašek.
Jančura has already announced last week that it will invest several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the inappropriate step of the countries.
Radioman said that the Christmas campaign will be interrupted and he wants to continue after New Year's Eve.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
Kampaň began Jančura after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech roads and to order around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, similar actions are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur thought he was also threatened by a Member for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, then we could lose our bus license.
He presented himself as Member of the ČSSD, I know which master is about, his name will not be said, today said RadioJurnal Jančura.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccinations have been inflammable since January.
It is to be the first for families free and also optional.
However, voices are already heard that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparation for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumonia peaks.
The medical institution is already setting the maximum price for vaccines that pay health insurance.
Experts are also clearly in vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccinations for children of August
Since January, children born last August 2 and later may be vaccinated free of charge against pneumonia.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Whoever started to get too vaccinations last year or before, they'll have to pay for their own time.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
She volunteered to have her children vaccinated against the pneumococcals of the family last year.
Parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are required when the youngest children are vaccinated.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will issue 300 to 450 000 crowns per year on the vaccination dose.
But they will save for the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state for all the full vaccinations of children has given about 500 grand a year.
The mixed vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain black and blood poisoning.
He will die of pneumonia infection in our country in one year according to the investigation in hospitals up to 28 children up to 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced fertilized platform vaccinations against pneumococces in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are ideas that this vaccination might be mandatory in the future.
Since January, insurance and optional services are to be covered.
That mandatory vaccination would be better, for example, indicated the head of the Civil Society Navol Rudolf Kalovský.
His pneumococcal vaccine association has long been promoting.
Experts at the international conference that took part in our association were not fully satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been done.
I think that's the path we have to enter now, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumonia.
At this point, we don't consider it at all, said his spokesperson Vlastimil August.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says doctors
Vice-President of the Medical Society of practical physicians Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that he has voluntary vaccinations with his disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered as a reduction in the number of vaccinations -In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand quite a political decision that the vaccination was released as voluntary,” says Cabronochová.
Experts expect their infants to get more than 80 percent of their new parents from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is breakable even in the fact that it is the first full vaccination of children by health insurance companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save for further treatment, explains Cabronoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own substances.
However, this is related to the concerns of practical physicians relating to the purchase of a vaccine.
According to the original intention, vaccines should buy insurance companies and doctors would receive them the same way as the state provides substances for other vaccinations.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance companies could make money out of health insurance.
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to estimates, individual medical physicians will invest 40 000 per month in the vaccine, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabronoch.
The son of an American artist ' steals in a museum'
The son of a renowned American fantasy creator Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal pictures worth $20 million ($12 million) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazetta and the second man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountain Basg region.
Mr. Frazetta's senior, age 81, became famous for the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzan's character.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as the Press Press Press Press Press Press Press said.
The AP quoted the smallest police officer who said that Mr Frazetta younger could be motivated to act by long-lasting family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta gave his younger strict statement, age 52, that he did so to his father’s direction, to get to the museum in any possible way and move the images to the storage space, as the Agency said.
Mr. Frazetta, Senior, denied the granting of any such permission as the Agency has said.
Labourists are prevented by the planned increase in taxes
The Minits advocated the rise in taxes and cost cuts, as announced in the preliminary report on the counter-crisis budget by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling, Tory said, the possibility was to demonstrate that they were seriously decommissioning the decision to reduce deficits until the elections.
Even the Chancellor got under fire because of the disabled working with low and medium income.
According to his proposal, this is mainly about an increase of 0.5% in social security and 1% of public payments since 2011.
Disclosure regarding social security
The congregations protested that working with low incomes were punished for the recession they did not commit and warned in advance of the ‘problems’.
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of approximately 3 trillion pounds per year - which has enriched the community of entrepreneurs who have stated that this is a employment tax while it should be aimed at restoring the economy.
This increase, limited to these revenues exceeding GBP 20000 per year, will be affected by approximately 10 million workers.
KEY BOODS OF PBR
Social insurance will increase by another 0,5 % from April 2011
Economic situation will worsen more than expected by 4,75 % this year
New taxation of 50% of banker bonuses
The increase in 1% of corporate tax for write-offs in small companies
Tax reduction for electric vehicles and wind plants
Retiring pensions by 2.5 %
According to the estimate of the state’s financial administration, some revenue of £30000 is reduced by £90 per year and some €40000 will be reduced by £ 190, while some of the revenue of £ 10,000 will increase by £ 110.
Ministers announced that their objective of reducing the deficit by half to 2013 would mean complex decisions, but they insisted that 60% of the specific taxes should come to 5% of those with the highest income.
The Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the proposed increase in taxes and restrictions on expenditure would be a \"cap in the ocean\" compared to what would have to be done.
This allows us to reduce deficit by half, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the following four years, - told the BBC.
Mr Timms stated that he believed that economic growth should take place over the year.
But drawing up the forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In its opinion, the decline in the economy was 4,75 % this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline, predicted in April - because loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A wasted opportunity'
Contractors who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the ‘crises of debts’ of the labourists, referred to the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds in the next six years as insignificant.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as it might be, to add, to the contrary, to postpone this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
“They did not add anything significant that would be feasible,” said the shadow Minister of Finance Philip Hammond.“They had the opportunity to do so, but they wasted it.”
“All important notifications will be made after the elections, if we win them,”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts unlike the Tory proposals to reduce deficits faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats claim that money generated by tax increases and cost cuts should be used to support expenditure in the next year and not to reduce deficits and argue that plans are ‘set on sand’.
The policy commentator BBC Nick Robinson stated that the notice would increase, for example, the above mentioned inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay the next April - that this could lead to the accusation of the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money would have been difficult to return by a year later.
But labourists insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspect budget'
Even though the ministers did not publish the expenditure after 2011, the economics stated that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be at the beginning of the medium term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budgetary Studies stated that Chancellor's figures indicate substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the bookhouse include transport, higher education and defence.
“It is really very painful so far,” said his director Robert Chote.
“All important statements will come after the elections, if we win them,” added Roger Bootle, the economic adviser to the reviror of Deloitte accounts.
This was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget.
The FBI's investigating in America's prisons in Pakistan
The FBI's investigating in Pakistan's prison with five Americans, suspects connected to extremists.
The men were arrested for attacking the house in Sargoda in the province of East Pandjab, as told by the BBC of the American embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI has told us that this is an investigation of whether it is the same men who have been declared missing since the last month in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that it is also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and others comes from Yemen.
“If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were held, and under what circumstances they were staying there,“ Ian Kelly said.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said that the agents were informed of the detention and were in contact with the families of missing students.
“We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their origin here and whether it really is a missing student,” she stated.
Pakistan's embassy in Washgington said that men were arrested in a house owned by one of them.
He said that the house was always the center of the interest of the local police and that there was no charge against the arrested men.
Hillry Clinton's foreign minister refused to comment on arrest, told Reuters the press agency, but said that the United States had to work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan during the separation of terrorism infrastructure, which is continuing to recruit and train individuals.
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejecting the amnesty for the Irish bullying.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years as the Amnesty International expedition report.
The report describes in detail the torture methods, in the regime before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One of the men said that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and others said he threatened to rape him.
Iran denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials referred to this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmúd Ahmedinejad, leading to the greatest street demonstrations from the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them have been brought into custody, and the applicants have sentenced the last five people to death row.
In the protests of the BBC in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that previously the highest leader of Ayjatolah Alí Chomejni declared the incorrectness of some torture methods and prohibited their execution in the repair facility of Karizak.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
Wrong confession'
Amnesty International quoted the report by a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology Ibrahim Methari, who claimed that he was charged for working with Facebook networks and for protests against the results of the election.
“I have often been beaten in my face,” he stated in the statement.
“I was struck by cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened by the execution and humiliated me.
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, constantly bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated President's candidate Mehdi Charroube was arrested after the protests after the elections and was tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied rape charges, but they admitted torture.
Amnesty also reported the case of an ex-con who said he was held in a container with other 75 persons for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
The Amnesty recognised that the Irish Parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate the electoral unrests and reactions of the government, but said that the mandate and powers of the institutions were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were lost.
The group stated that at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes were created in the town park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the monument in Bristol into a riding track for the race.
The riding track for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and Snowbordists to compete for financial prices.
At the peak of the riding track in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump bridge before 100 m long riding track.
Student of the fourth year of medicine John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the slopes track, but that it was truly depressing.
It was a wonderful view of the shiny lights of the city down there.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents, - added.
Prices were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the riding track.
After the fourth evening race, snow was left to melt.

Can he be French Muslim?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called after the ban on the construction of minerals and generally spread alarm reports about the alleged Islamicization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed and thought of whether the Muslims could integrate themselves - and whether they were integrated into one of the most open secular companies of the continent.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author’s latest work, why the French don’t like cups on their head -(2006), this elegant and discussed study on the issues they share and employ the country for 15 years and whose impact is still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the base.
He spent months in the Mosque, Schools and Institutes, which are now looking after 5 ́6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces“
He's a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues that are most concerned about them.
Should Muslim enter the marriage union in the Mosque or at the City Hall (or both places)?
Should young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can Muslims marry a man who's not Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seem to be the global disputed issues that are discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than the political drama that employs the media.
The author identifies the new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other common known persons, does not include Tarika Ramadana, Araba, Muslim researchers and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is attempting to open up a discussion on how it can be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their commons.
Conservators are distrustful of the true idea of the French or European Islam.
The philosophians and activists with whom Mr Bowen conducted an interview are referred to as the house that this is an anti-pea of Selafi, the victims of the Sunni Islam, associated with Saudi Arabia, are small but affecting European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians are (and intellectual elites, who defends the Latin public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
The view is that Muslims are likely to have less experience in faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular Republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, the retreading of the screws of the values was found.
Can Muslim French? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say - yes, but not now -
The world's most precious prospects
The Arctic is changing more dramatic than the other environment of the planet.
The bordering ice flows at an alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as elsewhere.
Oil, gas and fishing companies' interests must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In the book, Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, shows the natural history of the icons of the North, the polar bear.
A well-known history and procedures of whalery describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to beat a white bear.
Meeting Admiral Nelson with a courageous 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musket collage is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who sailed behind the bodies of their just-killed mothers were caught and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in one circus tent.
Even today the zoo fences have typically a million times smaller area than they have available to adults in the wilderness. Klima is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has torn green from allae groving within the low hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to threats that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis, and they are all armed with powerful attack towels that shoot off their prey.
The irony is that it happens in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book -After the ice - Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfied responsibility of science for Arctic and a tedious summer view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Nor meteorologists and oceanographers have adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjofa Nansen's research trails at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century, for the first time indicated how the ice flow occurred.
The submarines for the Cold War then sang the shifting shifts when they flooded them.
Satellite surveys and large-scale probe fields in floating refrigerators are a useful supplement, but many are still taking place due to unscrupulous individuals, camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into an extremely fragile world of speedy system within the Arctic ice, created by cutting down saltwater, which is frozen.
But from the height of that bear to the microscopic miracles, all this is condemned to destruction as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.

6,000 Marines have been dedicated to graves in Arlington
Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple feat on a soldier's grave, with which he never met.
For him and other members of the Marine Corps who took a trip from the camp Johnson in Jacksonville in North Carolina to the National cemetery in Arlington to ornament the graves, that was the day when they gave up the tribute to men and women who used to wear the same footwear.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I am trying to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put a dedication to the cemetery vets in several departments at the Arlington Pied Act.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to ornament several hundred graves at a stamp act in Arlington.
It is now 18 years old tradition, when Mr. nMorillo and his wife Karen are taking this journey every year and stopping in different cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters do not seek profit from this, accommodation across America, which are also found in other states.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 people on the Arlington cemetery, in the Pentagon territory, on the graves of the National Feyetteville cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the historic site of the flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart's Foundation has spent over 150,000 dollars on the purchase and transport of the occupants.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said she took her trip to Arlington to honor her husband, the deceased member of armed forces.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to the sacrifice.
It's a small way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Engulfed into the rains of the warm substance were the volunteers of the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for the elders of World War I and War II in Vietnam, because these are not visited as often as the newer graves.
The charge was positive when the kids played and held their hands together when they were transporting young pines to our bare tombstones.
Each circular dove was darkly green with a small red arch of the top part.
Near section 60, where most of the veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried, there was indeed silence.
The joint service organisation dedicated 1000 dedicated dedicated to the decoration of the department, but the glamorous mood of the just passing wars filled this area.
Some were earnestly crying, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some have read the names out loud, cast into the stones, while others have bowed down to look at small black and white names, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones have not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who would wipe tears from their eyes in front of their son's grave.
She went out of Zanesfield for eight hours in Ohio to visit the place of the last rest of the Sergeant's violent artillery, David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single.
“Although I was long gone, I want to be the one to remember him--
American government contractor trapped by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops to the country, as the officials of the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, has worked for the company Development Alternatives Inc. with its seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the US Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, were looking for access to a detention that was imprisoned on December 5.
Some charges have not been published, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is called “insecure”;
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical statistics, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take over prices, but the authorisation was refused.
The arrest of an American supplier can be the result of a growing tension between communist Castro's brother, the government of Cuba, and Obama's administration, which has been followed as a “maintaining tactics” in improving relations with the island.
It was the first time they filed a report on the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban Government takes specific steps, such as the release of political prisoners, and the creation of more space for opposition, the associated states will take part in the reciprocity action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought commodities in the country where the average salary of the public employee is $115 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly by text messages because the 15 minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
Use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
The Cubans, who often want to sign up, must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handfuls of U.S. citizens in Cuba are behind bars for shorts like drug smuggling, reports Gloria Berben, the press department Section for American interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't give more information about prison.
The arrest and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities that would be legal in any other open society - give it free mobile phones - are in Cuba a criminal act, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American human rights programme group, who recently published an adverse report on freedom in Cuba, called the New Castro, Cuba's name, - as an obstacle to the installation of Raul Castro as a leader of the country and a compensation for the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivianco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and arrested in one day.
He pointed out that all the solutions would be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative response in the United States, just when these two countries are heading towards an extensive dialogue.
Pakistan's civil administration workers are spreading conspiracy regarding the transmission of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday an alleged conspiracy leader concerning the dispatch of five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops there, and said that they hoped that this case could help cover a large network of terrorists who are coming online and seeking radicalized young men.
The investigators said that they were looking for grey rebel figures, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after they first discovered them when one of these men posted comments, approving terror attacks has an online YouTube videopage.
Saifillah took the lead of these men, as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into the remote area of Pakistan in the area of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, home of al-Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer, who reported on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was failed to testify to the al-Qaeda commanders and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate into the terrorist network.
As a result, they were set up for several days to the eastern part of Sarghody, far from the terrible mountains in the Northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered to be a hit unit.
That's why they were released, he told an official who was talking about maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that men were not intimidated and were still trying to get consent to access Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the performance of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is more important, determining who is credible.
Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the US Intelligence has assigned the highest priority to attempts at putting human resources into al-Qaeda.
Collectors act as guardians, extorting those who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to the holy war and those who could be the scouts.
American fake recruits were subjected to special investigation at al-Qaeda, reported analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because given their potential approach to the American goals and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohmann, an older analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more careful in recent years, allowing the coach to join them because American intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, is there no better way to follow according to their selection model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanded climate action.
Tens of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday and demanded stronger climate action from negotiators in Bell's city congress centre.
The protestors have reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police are overestimating that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small places near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day when there was a small event during the climate talks that was sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists were going through the city and did not have banners with English inscriptions -This is not a planet B - (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, who spoke - the country says 'eat' -
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish models and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that she went to her mother's home house in Peru and provided me with information on the unhappi state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still happening.
This is a partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the leading personality of the world to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to do so, it cannot be avoided.
The police prevented protesters from joining Bell's center and said that they held 19 people, first of all because they either had masks or pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the participating viewers who does not want to be identified because he is involved in a corner of climate, activists masked as athletes and in black suits they lay several places near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministrys.
They Agitited at the buildings, said, began with lights, but then followed the large explosions.
Inside the congress centre, people gathered around television screens to follow the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not lead to the awareness of key officials, such as Su Wei, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether even the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he answered the English “Actually, that is something that I was not aware of” (it is indeed something I do not realize).
Then he continued in China and said: ‘Because the scene is vast, I cannot hear what is going on outside’
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of everyone.
It is visible to focus the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: ‘It can also be said that this is an infringement or freedom of other persons.
Date of the test revealed constant continuing racial differences
A federal certificate from last week on the knowledge gained from mathematics was a welcome element of good news regarding the public education of Columbia.
Although the precinct is far behind the country’s high performance systems, certificates have shown more progress in fourth and eighth grade pupils in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last numbers of the National Research Centre for Progress in Education are the persistent differences in knowledge achieved between African Americans and white students and both on the local page and on the national page.
The average result of the fourth class white pupils of the Columbia District in the last two years increased from 267 to 270 points (from possibly 500), but only three points were raised in their African-American peers, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge gained has actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 points to 57.
The progress with African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a reference to a statistically negligible one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not yet encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils of fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP was made in the precinct, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in both groups was significantly improved during this period, the difference was hardly close to 58.
Some of the advocates of education in the district last week expressed that the results, celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee's mystery and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) have been stimulated in a large number of white students where the results have already been high.
That would suggest that we have increased the support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, non-equity group that defends the equality of education in the district.
I don't jump up and down because of the dispersion of two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton primary school.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs. Rhee's administration, Mrs. Brown stated that the report on the results of the test meant secondary school in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the hammers and I respect it.
But what's amazing is that we didn't owe nearly any time and energy that we needed to pay to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the attempt to rob is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained to use the new curriculum, Wilson's reading system, focused on students of higher primary schools and students of secondary schools who could not handle the basics of reading earlier in their knee careers are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics and curriculum teaching mathematics in the sixth grade, emphasising the game and experience of real life, which took place in the district behind former director Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the general progress of NAEP, about which the report was submitted last week.
And I just think that we should continue working and perform the best possible intervention in those students who remain under the class level, said Mrs. Rhee.
Others stated that the results of the NAEP have clarified whether Mrs Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a certain win-win dilem of Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the California University of Berkeley where he's studying the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional repair procedure is to focus the resources and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of the Columbia district.
Thus, it can focus on political challenges that are facing an important agenda.
But the survey also includes other urban directors who try to maintain the medium-sized dimension between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We must use the relativeness of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to provide excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now Head of School in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to carry out school rights.
You need to get up to 200 days so that you can make changes, Mr. Janey, who has concluded a contract with his teachers' association last year for 185 days, which is considered to be a “sign” to search for a greater increase in the next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
The tour bus went to Gettysburg college with loud breathing.
Player Rodriguez, 12 years old, went out and had a white column, brick facades and emerald green lawns for a moment.
Players of parents had a hard time grading a high school in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the track.
Now she and other eighth grade pupils in the group studied Gettysburg, where the school was $38690 a year, their position was rather than a warning of the enthusiasm of potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Gracie, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
She was thinking about showing them the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania railway was one of the seven which they visited at their three-day tour and now they were fully captured by the future report: The question is not whether you will enter the train.
The question is from where.
However, this is a serious problem with regard to the high number of born Spanish immigrants who are excluded from higher schools or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get a college education and enter middle class.
Indeed, the fifth generation - Spanish students from college - remarkable results show that many of their migrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central America, got to the United States without finishing their high school.
Their story of success is important, they teach researchers, because it undermines their point of path forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the field of labour force of the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural inclination to school and the birth rate and efforts to succeed.
Many have also had parents who set their children high goals and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Players and millions of children who would like to graduate railways - especially if they continue in time.
If we look at the low income groups that parents have no experience and ability to help them not to understand in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándar, a researcher at the California University of Davis, where she studied students from Latin American areas.
We need to think about giving these children a preschool network of all ways to go to college.
The Federal Programme, which financed the Gracialy tour in the tracks, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (to spend), provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to launch railway preparatory programmes that are based on groups with small incomes in secondary schools and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of which have entered colleges, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iranian Ministry of Oil has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to bring significant oil companies to rebuild their inhuman infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have concluded the Iraqi oil industry Ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a significant role in restoring the Iraqi oil industry, the frozen wars and sanctions.
The US companies have left with capital participation in just two out of 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction that started on Friday.
Only one has submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on a field that was hit in June.
The level of participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have in the first place on the road of Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor Iraq Oil Forum, online intelligence.
That's gonna be a long time before something else is in Iraq for sale.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of American armies are likely to reflect American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has clearly the third largest raw reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, US companies were in disadvantages, in particular China and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more vulnerable to risking because they are not responsible for shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The previous American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have kept close contacts with the Iraqi oil industry ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The State National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts to two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic, as well as technological force, said the spokesperson of the oil department Assam Jihad.
We believe that China's company will be comparable to competition and will have its obligations vis-à-vis Iraq.
Companies that were initially selected for the submission of tenders which were then compared by the Ministry according to the barel price and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output over the current level in each field.
An al-Qaeda spy planner was probably killed in Pakistan.
On the impact of the American rocket on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was likely the killing of the top al-Qaeda operations planner, as announced on Friday, by U.S. counterterrorist officers.
As confirmed, it could be the second fatal attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Sahl al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets occurred in the quarter of their car near Miran Åáh in the province of Sevverní Vaziristan, according to American resources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have found that rockets have been fired from an aircraft without a crew type with which the CIA operate in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were led to a white car that was headed towards the Afghan border when he was hit, he reported an official along with Pakistanan foreign intelligence agency who called from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local armedmen came to the point and quickly entertained what was left of the - totally destroyed bodies -
Local authorities were unable to verify the victim's identity, but two U.S. counterterrorist officers quoted an unspecific witness who said Somalia was the post of death.
Somalia was presented as a highly built-in military operation planner for al-Qaeda, who ran operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in reinvention throughout the world, said a higher official who does not want to be appointed to demonstrate the sensitive nature of the American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaida's superior leadership and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another American official said that Somalia quickly progressed in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but he did not have to be humiliated in any way, in advance of us and our allies, he told another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second highly constructed leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban who should have been killed since September when the attack was killed by Najmudin Jalol, the leader of the militant faction in the band of indigenous tribes and three other top poperative leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aeroplanes has decreased from the average years from around six operations per month to two, according to Long War log, the website, managed by the non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also lovingly killing those who suspected they were informants, said a page.
The upper delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
The United Nations High Delegation in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to withdraw from his function in March and end the stormy term of office, which had been accused of large-scale corruption in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure occurs because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation stated that it encouraged growth, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for reducing the state that begins in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO States to withdraw its power.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel helping political transformation of Afghanistan.
Growing on the side of armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise that he gave his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a refund.
As I said, it's high time to look after the successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between leaving my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a refund.
Officials stated that the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who had Swedish- Italian origins and had previously led the UN mission in Bagdada, and Jean-Maria Guéhenne, the Frenchman, who had conducted the UN peace operations before that.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraitho, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzáim, who won the Earth's presidential elections from masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but he stated that the charges of Galgraith -- which was released -- he was determined to damage the mission, because there was a high degree of tendencies with regard to international intervention - at the choice.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens for the coordination of the ease of efforts with the US force in Afghanistan.
He also insisted on the UN leadership to enable its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, therefore, as he says, he would like to strengthen their trust that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment in restricting his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the difficult UN regulations on hire undermine its ability to use its capacity.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon be imposed on Iran by further significant sanctions, due to lack of engagement in the talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in Northern Iraq during a week's journey to areas where he was fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, was playing the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the soldier's question on the likely development.
One of the things that depend on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is unthinkable inconvenient infidelity in the war.
Obama's administration is determined by a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that “the stimuli and the weapon” would require“the Iranian government to really feel less safe with nuclear weapons - because they“ are the residents to suffer extremely - sanctions.
According to the Friday's opinion, spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration involved a European leader in a warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme to full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about the restriction of his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his supply of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administrative Board held itself in favour of such an agreement as a way to establish confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems that Iran has been withdrawing from the provisional agreements - partly because it states an expert because the Irish leadership has been divided into views of whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly speaking, as regards Irish hardness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he has actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think that this has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a journey that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before he returns to search for other elections, including the follow-up, which was once called the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for “degrading sanctions”
In its opinion in New York City, the Iranian UN mission condemned what she called “unfounded and unfounded accusations” against some of the members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that she wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers in order to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who went back to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with the Iranian Prime Minister Nouri al-Malika before he flew to the area of the Kurdian, rich in oil, to meet soldiers in Kirk and with the Kurdian leaders in Irbil.
There is a high tension between the Kurda and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially due to borders, property rights and distribution of revenue.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent the suspension of US plans to reduce the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates was also trying to dampen Kurdish concerns from persistent depression. The U.S.'s official location quoted Gates when he told Masudu Barzaan, President of the Kurdist Regional Government: \"We want to protect your safety, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We do not want to leave you.
In an ageing China, change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which they read that “The Mother of Earth is too exhausted to feed more children - and “One child means one extra grave -
Then they learned that when the official government seat in Shanghai, alarmed by low births and ageing of the population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We haven't left anything for each other, says Wang, 31st years, the human resources manager who has an 8 month son.
For more than 30 years, the ongoing policy of China has only one child has been introduced and the country is threatened by the population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy was implemented according to the UN data.
Breakdown of the population, where the population aged 60 and higher is predicted to grow from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater than rich coastal cities with population population with higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over were almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered residents while birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Family Population and Planning said, many couples must have children in order to help reduce the proportion of ageing population and reduce the number of labour force in the future -
He says it's about being old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden --
Progressive calming
As it was inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party to this day.
The two who broke the policy faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese official sites promoted policies that helped the country prevent critical drawing of natural resources while human rights defenders were judged in promoting policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women during the second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexistly selected abortions, leading to an unnaturally high relationship between men against women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, the exception was generally permitted - including the inhabitants of cities, members of national minorities and cases where the male and female were the only -- and in 2007, they reduced the disciplines of their Hesels, promoting the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Populatory Research of Peking University, said that central government officials had previously discussed radical changes such as allowing couples to have two children if one of their partners was an only child.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city that launched an aggressive campaign to encourage multiple births.
Almost overnight there were posters, encouraging parents to have only one child, replaced with copies of the regulation, detailedly describing how it would be justified to have another child and how to apply for permission.
The City Administration sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and to put flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, reported to the family planning officers.
Injury response
Although officials in one rural city in Shanghai reported an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the city districts did not report any changes.
The City District of Huinan with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign the number of births in the city in 2010 was still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee on Family Planning in Shanghai, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to give it to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that she liked two children, and it was legally possible for them.
But like many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a potable net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West judge the policy of one child wrong as a legal question, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in a relationship with the first child in seven months.
Yes, we were sick of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples show psychological reasons for weighting.
Wang, the human resources manager, says that only one child is wanted, because she was also an only child: ‘We were the center of our family's attention, and we were all looking after us.
We weren't used to provide care, and in fact we didn't want to take care of each other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who was the top translation company, expressed this much less uncovered.
For his two-cariary middle-class parents who had reduced birth, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years growing up looking at parents like the first days of Chinese experiment with capitalism, and they don't want this way of living for themselves, they say.
Just one child puts enormous requirements for parents' time, says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still contested questions about the Propstor -- you have to rebuild your apartment -- and the strategy -- - you have to have the resumé ready at a time when the child is 9 months for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle down with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has outlined the plan for reducing emissions.
The United Nations climate conference -- characterised by far-reaching unscrupulous attitudes and mutual plasma -- focused again on the release of a document that proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, bearing most of the burdens in the near future.
The text that can provide an exit for the final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases highlights the remaining obstacles as it illuminates the way forward.
But it was seen important progress in negotiations that took place at a wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc Working Group, this text presents insignificantly how much money a rich country should provide to those poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key questions, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can reduce their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of global temperature increase that political factors will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a large dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, head of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammmit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, a 180-page text from the negotiations to focus on what the top climate officer at the UN, Yvo de Boer described as a “great picture”
It sets out the outline for the possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent in the year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union has discussed quickly on Friday the promise that it will provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptations to climate change -- from flooding and drought to deforestation.
However, Friday still gave the same kind of verbic fireworks that they thought during the talks last week.
The US Special Ambassador for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech requiring binding reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for the industrial country compared to voluntaryity with the major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The report signaled that Obama's administration had made a tougher line towards China than Busho's officials were administration two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of the actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told America's main climate negotiators that either lack of “selic reason” or “minimum irresponsibleness” had led earlier one week to report that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future economic pathways of the world's main powers at stake, the tahanics broke down both inside the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fight takes place mostly on the conservation of individual economies rather than the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while poorer nations point out that two decades of the most influential countries of the world ignore scientific imperative to implement more pressing actions.
Ricardo Ulate, delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way of preventing large issuers responsible in their actions.
It is a clear game that the new economic hegemony develops, said Ulate, which also serves as regional consultants in the area of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change indicated that they wanted to continue to enforce legally binding agreements in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best result of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who conducted international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that enforcement by small island nations, has brought political pressure on the whole political process - partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations brought about new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the remaining contested questions before the heads of the government were concerned with the agreement.
High positions of officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environment Jairam Rames and the Chinese Deputy Minister, have come out of the aircraft and have been through Bella's halls to a closed door of meetings and new conferences so that they can set out the claims that will be assessed next week.
The total scale of the assembly - when 13000 people moved from and to the congress centre each day, on guitars playing activists in the night ironing the sight of the countries they thought had sent them out, and there were proposals from hand to hand on paper rather than electronic mail -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only overbuilding: in Copenhagen almost all key ministers were present and earlier at the center of 60 Heads of State.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy on International Nature Protection.
Hard weights are coming.
British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour had this Monday feeling
At 5:13 on Monday morning, the hwizd took the dark at the sign of departure of the train, which meant a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches 140 miles per hour and flies from Ashford in Kent to the London St Pancras and exceeds the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed passenger kit outside of lLndýn.
It hopes that the new service, where appropriate, will link Britain to the international network of fast, reliable trains and link the great aglomeration of Midland, North and Scotland to London.
Restrict standing water should reduce transport times in passenger transport and on business routes and transitions from aircraft and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road traffic jams.
Theoretically, three main political parties have obtained a vision for this.
But dozens of pounds of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, an inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disturbance have now led to the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a realistic study, has submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as reported by the Times.
It provided a detailed map of the route of the next planned high-speed network.
A new route of London's connection with the western Midland was proposed within five metres in urban areas and quarters, where it could be problematic to reach a living environment.
In the open landscape was scheduled until 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also foresees to determine three choices for a wide-ranging high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer spring.
The preferred option is to confront the shape of letter Y, where one high-speed track should lead to Western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle above Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
“It looks like the most powerful choice took place,” he said and found railways.
As soon as it's done, driving times between London and Edinburgh will be short for two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage that will not be opened before 2025 could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in their presence.
The proposals should allow trains to drive 2250 miles per hour, which would make the fastest in Europe from the British network.
The initial track is already designed to carry trains of 400 m long, capable of transporting 1100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London- Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would extend so as to understand the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis announces whether it means or not to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision does not come before general elections.
Even if it places its wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a crucial point to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, the orientation point for the revolution to the railway.
Tax taxpayers stole a mortgage of £75,000 on Tory's oranges
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory's front seat bench in the Chamber of Parliament, stole thousands of pounds of taxpayers' costs last year for the oranges built in his house in the election district.
The spokesperson for a prison that was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the Members lived from the allocations - increased their mortgage to £75,000 to build a dub of expanded expansion in their second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month of taxpayers.
The current authorities have approved claims on time and so was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the control of the Member States of expenditure. Last night, Mr. Duncan spoke of his requirements - it was to be cleaner or easier -
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two floors of houses in the village in its constituency district of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There's a kitchen on the ground floor, a living room and a dining room, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the house of the winter garden, which is marked in the plans as a “corruption”.
The neighbors describe it as “the greenhouse for fun and hospitality“
Mr Duncan has not been asked to provide any explanation for an increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the Pupilar's mortgage security of £271406 from his property in London to the house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed about £400 per month in the interest of a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over £1,800 per month.
The interest of Mr. Duncan's RBS mortgage could not have changed at this time, indicating that all of this was intended to finance a loan of £75000.
The standard variable RBS mortgages decreased in December 2007 from 7,94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, which remained.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 this month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his work as the shadow leader of the House in September after one secret publisher filmed him and said that the Members had to survive the assignment after the expense scandal.
“In principle, it is born, you have to live on a ration and treat you as with the**t -
He said: “I spent money in my garden and claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn thing, but I won't do it.
The MP, a millionaire from former oil careers, was first invited to explain his edition in May when it turned out that he was entitled to thousands of pounds for his garden, before approval by the Financial Authority that it could be considered excessive,
One of the activists kicked the pit in the shape of a libra mark in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it turned out he was entitled to £4,000 for three years.
When asked to increase the mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said: ‘It was because of the capital increase, which was approved both by the financial authority and then by Legg,
He added: ‘This is not a disputed question of hiding and knocking or breaking rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to the bottom line, according to the rules, right and that's all.
This would not be more clean or easier to be many other ways -
Come and see the cabin on the Brighton Coast with an advent calendar.
Coast cabins in Brighton found new meaning of life in winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates duplicating creativity called for 24 owners to pick up their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas bikes as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were able to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and bishop bread and cooked wine provided free of charge.
The selected colleagues included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage represented the work of Janety Tozerová, the local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant at the Hove television marketing, is a priest without scholarship in the Chicago diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in the post - Christian society.
Why are we supposed to expect people to come into an old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a awakening way.
“The idea of an advent calendar in the cabins was just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place, and we have tried to try and present the spiritual way--
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands went to the streets on Saturday with a demand for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police resources and one hundred thousand according to the organizers manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish President of the climate conference, stated that growing global mobility, which is a clear proof of today's manifestity, has contributed to a political tax - a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break out the tiles with tiles and hammers.
Order police have immediately hit strongly.
A total of the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was mainly about members of the Blacks Blocks, ultraradic separate groups, which had already been shown in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
The Climate Action Coalition (IP), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested - without distinction - and stressed that about a hundred of them were in cuffs and in the saddles - kept in the streets even on Saturday night - despite the extreme winter.
Following Parliament's departure, the guide was set up in a quiet direction at Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
For the speakers, a podium was built, before which the spiritual meeting took place in candles for the participation of the former South African archipelago of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters came by bus and train from large European cities and besides Africans there were also a large number of Asian participants, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue coats, created in the morning hours of Copenhagen the first meeting, and that was the challenge of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create a “blue waves” - for a righteous climate.
Today we go to the street to demand a settlement of ecological debt in favour of the South, explaining to the people Nacpilová, the Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying, \"It's time for that,\" said the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water flows dry, we can walk in them today and that has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by adopting the UN Convention, the movement of fighting for another world has drawn closer to environmental organisations.
The French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with a view to ‘propriating climate and social justice’: ‘There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and fighting for another world.
The first Manifestation began in an Asian-Tichor Sea region in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets by the organizers.
In Manile, several hundred people were marched, mostly students, in red clothing, and with scarves of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada several hundred demonstrators came to the streets with a demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (jih), Lille (sever), Bordeaux (pad) and Lyon (west) were involved in protests organized by the movement.
There were several tens of people in Geneva.
Separatistic Abkhazia chose her president, Georgia condemns this as a “fraction”
Abkhazia chose her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-ru separatist territory as independent in Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declare this step as a “fraction”
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Greek War in August 2008 on control over South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The wedding rooms were closed in 17hdin GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz election commission, the participation was several hours before the 58% electoral rooms were closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, are denied the idea of the merger with Georgia, which judged these elections.
These choices are French.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili is regretting that Abkhazia has completely fallen into the Russian leadership,” said his spokesperson, Manan Manjgalagas.
In addition to Russia, they recognised the independence of this territory with only the inhabitants of Nicorau and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the Georgia department, after the conflict in 1992-1993, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through the election that she is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the letter of AFP Krvarčija WWWWWB, 54 years old historian, who also admitted to vote for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote for the election room at school in Suchumi capital, a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of the Russian superpowers is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the shore of the Black Sea, which can be proud of the beautiful nature.
All over this small country with 216,000 inhabitants are deployed huge billboards with Bagapš next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to see the apparent course of the elections were forced to receive warm acceptance from the district mayor of Beslan Arkby.
“We, the Abkhaz, have been grateful,” said in the small ceremony, in mind the support of Moscow, and in particular its decision to recognise Abkhazi’s independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexý Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, and drank glass vodka.
The opposition, represented by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimbo and two merchants Zaus Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbou, criticized contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control Abkhazia's railway network for a period of 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vital Bganba says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win elections.
If none of the candidates fail to achieve this result, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Klima: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands went to the streets on Saturday with a demand for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated around 700 people throughout the world and Copenhagen.
At least thirty thousand people according to police resources and one hundred thousand according to the organizers manifested an afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hostes until 18 December, delegates from 193 countries acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Following Parliament's departure, the guide was set up in a quiet direction at Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
For the speakers, a podium was built, before which the spiritual meeting took place in candles for the participation of the former South African archipelago of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after leaving the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators dressed in black and armed bricks and hammers began to break off the window.
The police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, and several manifestos hit the ground.
A total of the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was mainly about members of Blacks Blocks, ultraradic separate groups, which had already been shown in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Later this afternoon, one police officer was injured in the jaw, and four cars were burned near the quant near the incident that had been arrested by police sources.
We focus on the extremist group, warned the spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the police helicopters again flew into the air.
Most protesters who came by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue coats, formed the first meeting in Copenhagen at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create a \"blue waves\" - for a \"legal climate\"
Today we go to the street to demand a settlement of ecological debt in favour of the South, explaining to the people Nacpilová, the Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with a view to ‘propriating climate and social justice’: ‘There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and fighting for another world.
The Oxfam organization has called on several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or the former UN Commissioner for the Refugees Mary Robinson to speak to the crowd.
The first Manifestation began in an Asian-Tichor Sea region in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets by the organizers.
In Manile, several hundred people were manifested in front of the council of the capital of Philippines, mostly students in red clothes and with scarves surrounding the importance of solar energy.
Several hundred demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta with a demand for strong action against climate change.

Subjects of the country and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of general gymnasium, said Chatel.
The Minister for Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during an interview for the journal JDD that the history and country subjects will be mandatory in the framework of the reform of general gymnazia - although their teaching is no longer in the last year of the gymnazia, focusing on exact sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week, and for all, the same program from the general culture will be confirmed by Chatel.
According to the Minister, it is necessary to quit the hypocritical process, because he believes that specialization of S is no longer focused on exact science, but, essentially, the best students are in it.
The specialization of the EC and L cannot be sub-specializing, continuing and stressing: \"I have brought many historians and intellectuals who would have burdened themselves in the last year of professional gymnastics not to become a nationalist and history.
The study of Ifop, which published a Humanité daily on Saturday, showed that seven Frenchmen from ten (69%) disagree with the government project to cancel compulsory history and country teaching with specialization S, also many intellectuals and teachers criticized this cancellation, both left and right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that “it does not take into account - to cancel philosophy in the specialization programme of the School of Science.
At the same time, Luc Chatel prevented the reform of teaching, while 16 organisations (Students and unions) called for the participation of Tuesday mobilisation against this project, which, according to them, sacrifices pedagogical education to future professors of gymnazis.
As part of Master's Study 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year of the admission exam focused on their field and at the end of the year, another examination to verify their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
He will participate in professional internships during the second year of Master's studies and the first year will be performed as a professor-trainer before the pupils.
If you count all the internships that will be offered you before you receive the tender, you will gain more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continue.
The Minister also announced that it would propose a personal right to education, which does not exist in national education.
Once again, the project has confirmed the cancellation of the school map by 2012.
At the elite University of École normale soupers have 15 minutes of experts to convince about climate.
15 minutes for the presentation of the Copenhagen summit's objectives: this is the challenge announced by Jean Jouzel in the congregation morning, the Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole normalisation at Ulm Street.
As one journalist AFP informed, Jean Jouzel’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate opened the first of the conference “Ernest”, which is a one-day seminar consisting of 15 minutes’ contributions from experts who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and why they should learn more, explained at the occasion of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannez, one of the organizers of this seminar, who received a name according to the fish from the local pond that the students named this way.
A selection of about twenty supporting experts from individual scientific disciplines is selected and specified that the selection is based on their charism.
About climate warming: we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic targets in a few minutes,” said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke about 50 listeners with no pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-requisite notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, stressing with the hope that the listeners will know that the ‘code conference is leaning on a very seriously prepared scientific basis’
Videos recorded on these lectures will be placed on the website of the school from 15 December.
Next seminar -Ernest - is planned for February and others will follow the regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: disbursement of overseers in prisons, planned measures
Prison overseers reported on Friday - general mobilisation - because they demand that premiums and overtime be paid to them by Christmas holidays for financial reasons be paid to them for January.
The prison FO (2nd Ministry of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have the service to participate in demonstrations held on Tuesday morning before prison facilities and to “lock them off” and to draw attention to their wages.
CGT for prison overseers (3. Departments of this sector) has called on them to call for meetings in each prison and start a major mobilisation - with the fact that it is “study and unacceptable - so that the times and fees for work at night, Sundays and holidays - processed in October, have not been paid out in December.
The first branch of overseers, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), calls for overall mobilisation... in order to show dissatisfaction and bitterness.
The Administrative Directorates and Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been included in the financial budget, but ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The office said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent a message to the prison overseers' department in which he assures them that the payment will be made next month.
I know of the efforts that prison personnel are committed to ensuring the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the secretary in their communication.
I have ordered the administration of the prison to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation resulting from the poor assessment of the number of overtime has never repeated in the future has been added to Minister Alliot-Mari.
Therefore, the December wage will be low, with the exception of managerial workers who receive the famous premium for the performance and achievement of the objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those in the budget always finds a place.
It is just scandal, the interregional union of the FO in Marseille, and announced its decision to boycott into the appeal of all meetings and foretellations.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays if they are paid for these days from October will not be paid in December, even in overtime, also risks FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when they give us more work and more tasks without giving us more staff, it's sad to let you pay the most of your employees' position, CGT says the prison overseers in Bordeaux.
According to the union, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case, the funds are not enough, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama claims to provide better gifts on Christmas - than those received
American President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, believed that the screen of the Oprah Winfreys, had a simple rule: ‘I give better gifts than those I receive.’
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast Sunday night at the ABC station about how they were going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious housing.
Even Bo, a little four-year-old family companion gets his share.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, with the fact that the dog also “self” will receive a gift as a result of the events from the show’s preliminary broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also replaced against the claim of her husband on the subject of the quality of gifts that he receives: “So certainly not, I gave you the prime presents last year - she used the president.
Well, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after he showed his finger on the first ladies' pearl necklace: \"And who gave you this?\"
On this one-day very relaxed show, with the famous moderator, who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, they also talked about their unfaithful gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a ten stage transmission, but also a basketball ball, which he devoted to the Christmas of his Kenyan father, who only rarely met with him very rarely.
I remember seeing my father coming to see us Christmas and giving me the basketball ball, telling the president.
Until then I realized that the ball actually gave me him.
The first lady reminiscing doll houses.
I didn't know how I was supposed to organize it all in the house, so I compared all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little doll house, and I reminded Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operational, RTL states he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was reintroduced in Los Angeles because of the damage caused by the larger operation that he had performed in France, but the situation is according to his nearest - under control - while the RTL station said that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again operated at night from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American physicians realized the damage caused by the operation - the sinister gossip that he had done in Paris on 26 November, reported in Paris his press department, with the fact that these lesions required a “correction operation” in Paris.
However, the press department of the singer tried to calm the public and said that the situation was, under control, and also announced that no later than 48 hours would be given new medical communications.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial sleep to prevent the “bolests and complications“
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes we'll have a little bit more certainty, he adds RTL.
The press department, at the request of AFP, did not verify or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to some sources, no training was placed in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated at Parc Monica's international clinic because of the sinister fence.
The surgery scheduled for several days in advance was conducted by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor who was well-known in artistic circles.
However, on Thursday, a physician was not available to comment on RTL information.
After this operation, Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for infection that occurred after the hit.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on Thursday, on the radio RTL, that his friend was going through a bad time - but he added that he was not worried about rocker - because he was a big fighter -
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation, he told Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday, responds well to antibiotics, and that the infection has been built-in
Mr. Camus also said that he met with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he didn't notice any special concerns.
The health problems of a singer will only multiply from July when he was hospitalized for nine days after the fall on his yacht.
Two months later, for the surprise of everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a small tumor of thin intestines - and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour, Tower 66, which is presented as his bachelorette party.
But since then, each of his health problems has been well monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to review the report on new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championship in the large pool, won title on Thursday at the 2009 European Championship in a small pool in Istanbul, in a discipline that he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, which lastly allowed combinations, was only three world records, although they were expected to be much more.
One of them exceeded the Hungarian racers Evelyn Verractová to 200 m of semi-man's race and two of Russia's remaining men's strategists to 4x50 m of semi-final race.
The great grief for Bousquet, who was involved in the world record at 50 m free of charge, already held in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines swimming, 50m free way, the 28-year-old French with the final time of 20.53 seconds in the final final, where ten swimmers instead of normal eight were launched.
Bousquet defeated Chorvata Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russia Sergeje Fesikov (20,84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20.30) as he assumed.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers were wearing suits made from polyurethane, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
The combination helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which hosted them first in 1999 to the same competition.
The use of the combination this time did not help the Germans of Paul Biedermann, a twofold master of the world in a large pool in the summer of Rome, which had a world record on hand.
Young swimmers failed to overcome a record that holds at 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but yet won the second fastest time in their career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danán Mads Glassner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew this time I wouldn't overcome the world record, but I managed to defend my title and do my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival to the future, explained Biedermann.

The board of the Roman sarcophage, which had no one else but the French writer Emil Zolu, was auctioned on Thursday for 1.5 million US dollars, which is much more than estimated, said the Sotheby ́s businessman.
The price of this two metres long and 63 cm high front boards, originating in the third century of our flight, was estimated at 150,000 to $250,000.
The mramor - setting four Audionostic scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bakkhants is a rare piece, similar pieces in the world are very little, perhaps four or five, - told the AFP on Tuesday Florence Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby ́s.
The work was sold between hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is an object that has been destined for about the most, has told the AFP spokesperson Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernethy.

A disturbed attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions for transporting the late President Honduras, Manuel Zelay, who the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After a phone conversation that I had with President Zelay at night, everything for the time being shows that there is no way to remedy this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in the middle of Salvador for President Zelayu, flew back, introduced the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Pupist government wanted to force President Zelay to “demise” and to ask for political asylum abroad, only so that she could provide him with a safe exit.
But the accused president refused these demands because he wanted to leave for Mexico as an exile head of the state.
The Pupist government had experienced another failure when she wanted me to give up my duties..., they wanted me to give demiss, saying on Thursday Zelay's radio Globo, in which he often express himself to the political crisis that lasts for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, added the murdered president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's been playing a few acroords.
Mexican Embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, because it does not contain an asylum application, said at the centre of the Minister for the Interior of the Pussic Government, Oscar Raul Matute of the HRN radio.
I'm not asking for asylum, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for the Telesur station, which has its seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Dutch people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelay's departure were mobilised in the middle of the suspension of the noble president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the pusistian government.
They show their marginal attitude towards international standards, added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Innezuel President Hugo Chávez, was sentenced on 28 June, on the day he organized in preparation for his re-election of public consultation, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica returned unexpectedly 21st year old and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and held responsible for the crime - treason - from which he is accused, the pacistical government says.
President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelay.
In controversial elections, recognised by the United States, but condemned by Latin America as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won the Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.

For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on US trade balance numbers, which show that the activity improves in the fourth quarter.
The United States trade balance deficit fell in October compared to September of 7.6%, to $30.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have been increased.

However, in the United States last week, unemployment has increased against all expectations and the number of job seekers has reached number 474.000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers fell - the lowest in this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.

Cuba : Hundreds of supporters of the regime have been lit - Ladies in white -

The day before that, there was similar manifestations against the “Dams in white” in Havana, but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Vedado district of Havana, there were some ten dissidents who were also going to manifest themselves on the occasion of World Human Rights Day on Thursday, reported to the journalist AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have put dissidents who have been turned off by government officials to civil vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions lasts only a few hours.
The Sacharov Prize holders of the European Parliament for 2005 organized an unauthorized march for the ‘exploitation of all, according to the disent, about 200 political prisoners’, one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hétor Maceda is serving the penalty of 20 years of prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be ‘gifts’ or ‘agencys’ paid by their main enemy, the United States.
Cash miracle, Cuban television has provided a report on the fourth manifestation of government advocates against the revolution -
Cuba with the Communist Party in the head and politician of the Government of one part is regularly accused by European or American NGOs from non-consumption of human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
He killed a man of 80 and hurt five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A lunatic armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and hurt five other people in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of the tip on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old male in the pharmacy or before it, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of police and witnesses.
A badly injured old master, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance's Police Syndicate in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this pharmacy or before her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of 30, a husband began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital that killed the 80-year-old man.
The second wounded life is in danger, according to police sources, apparently vital authorities have been hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transported to the hospital in shock,” said the police source.
The armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then fled to the street, still on the Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more people, apparently, a 30-year-old and 40-year-old man, seriously the other man.
How it all happened is not quite clear, because everything took place in the evening.
He was armed with two cutting knives, which he carried with the cross behind his back, said at the site of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, tried to stop and arm themselves according to the evidence gathered by the AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They didn't succeed because he was pretty strong, he commented on Alberto's situation, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd, including one of the city policemen who broke his wrists, added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest armed men and were injured by their fists, reported a police source.
The incident took place in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The colleagues came to tell me that there's a wounded person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a large wound on the abdomen, told an AFP Frederick Allion agent, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, another 30-year-old lost, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have ID cards arrested the state police.
The state representative in Nanterre handed over the investigation matter to the Department of Regional Police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspect's attacker was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
The police source did not exclude his location in the psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said that there was a need for six police officers to take him to a police station in Clicha where he was taken.
He was, like, all the madmen of this type, whose power is increasing tenfold in action.
U.S. lawyer Polanski again asks for termination of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski re-appointed on Thursday in Los Angeles (Kalifornia, the West of the United States) for stopping criminal prosecution against his client currently located in his Swiss residence because of the moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film director-Pianist, criticized three judges of the Board of Appeal in California a serious mistake during the trial trial at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand to stop the prosecution now and now, said by lawyer Hummel and added that, from the behavior of a judge who decided at the time, Laurence Rittenbanda, had a hole in his back.
According to him, he had a judge (who had already died in between) before the judgment was ruled out to be dealing with a state attorney who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, which is a serious offense against the rule of law.
The information about this conversation appeared in the document: Roman Polanski: vanted and desired - (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the state attorney himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally stated at the end of September that he ‘ lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will request the hearing of a court order in which he will be able to submit evidence of his claim.
He repeated what he had already said in the first state, for there will not be any serious examination of an application to stop criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski comes to trial.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before the court brought a judgment in the matter of illegal sexual intercourse, with a minor age of 13 years.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
Deputy Prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski would be there to attend the court's trial trial trial.
In this case, we want to refer not only to Roman Polaski, but also to the defendants that it is possible to flee? he asks Mrs. Asayam.
It is the opinion that the director, after the court, is asking for a favor, and also despises his authority,
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that there are other alternatives to escape,
The lawyer Hummel was not alone who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also once again requested that criminal prosecution be discontinued.
She reminded me that her client could no longer bear this eternal harassment whenever the Polanski case came up and added: ‘No one in this room can say that the process was just--
Thirty-two years, that's enough--
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26th September in Switzerland under orders from the United States
After more than two months behind bars, he was released into a home prison in his cottage in Gstaad where he was waiting for a trial.
Wall Street ends without direction, stops a dollar rising.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is reflected between indicators that are better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the data from the final cap, Dow Jones Industrial Avery advanced from 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and finished at 2.190,31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It stays in close range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by publishing economic indicators which are better than expected, and which helped to improve the mood in the market in terms of economic recovery stability, was summarised by the analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November and it was the second month after it and much more than expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of US consumers has also returned, and in December it has increased strongly to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the rates have been frozen by a new increase in dollar prices against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which pushes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation, said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological action is how they lose their land under their feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The cost of the Treasury with a view to 10 years has increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% in the middle of the evening, and with a view to 30 years, it has increased to 4.497% compared to 4.49.2% a day earlier.
The choice of Miss World in South Africa again.
After monthly travel across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for Miss World on Saturday are going to cross the target finish to reach their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held around Johannesburg for the second year, and for the time being, five candidates have received a process into semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargboová from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Mae from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a true faith of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!
The competition held in South Africa after 9 am will be broadcast directly from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 17 hours (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream more beautiful land in which I put a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy to experience it twice, and Miss of the World of Ksenia Sukhin, in a hot South summer.
For the young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was held in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its country, which sets out the breath.
After months of performances, trials, meetings with the press and safari are now focused on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanky Chopraová, elected in 2000, which also took part in Aishware Rai, the 1994 winners, which both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just the look.
We are Members of my countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.

The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in suits.
The presentation will show the Chinese television moderator Angela Chow, former queen of the beauty of the South African Republic Michelle McLean and chairman of the Miss World Miss Steve Douglas Committee.
The Republic of South Africa has shown that she can welcome the world with a warmness that is difficult to cope with, declared Julia Morley, President of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates took part in safari last year, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and tasted local cuisine.
The extraordinary event was to meet South African President Jacob Zuma, who took their hands.
For the President's unusual, she noted Miss Sierry Leone.
Certainly the most beautiful memory will remain in Cape Town (in the Southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, which helped the country to support something more.
I could've met people I didn't dream of.
I'm sure I'm going back to World Cup 2010, he says I'm excited about Miss Italy Alice Tatacchi.
According to David’s son, reports on Hallyday’s condition are very positive.
The news about Johnny Hallyday’s condition is very positive, as his son David assured us at his Friday arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he arrived to visit his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, declared David Hallyday during a performance from a plane that arrived from Paris for a while after 13 hours of local time (221 hours of world time)
The singer’s son, who acted peacefully, said that he will, as soon as possible, arrive at the losangele hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johny Hallyday was taken on Monday due to post-op infection caused after the operation of the sinistered inter-brown gossip which he entered on November 26 in Paris.
According to the press release, the singer’s night in Los Angeles was given in order to be comfortable - led to artificial sleep - to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles who had already been put into an artificial sleep. Hospitalization occurred due to an infection after surgery of a warm interbetal gossip performed on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be again operational at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the information from photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended the French Lycea school performance on Friday morning in Los Angeles, attended by their daughter Jade.
Prediction of the orthopaedic surgery and traumaology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, reported to the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
A manufacturer of heavy charges was charged by Dr Stéphana Delajuxe, a neurosurgeon who operated on Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles have declared that they were demolished, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday has gone too quickly to Los Angeles with permission of his Parisian surgeon -
Personally, I spoke to a doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me very much, because I had already suffered twice as much from the cross-browning fences, he added.
A while earlier, radio RTL said that the singer probably flew off after the Paris operation without a drone, without anything --
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in artistic circles.
He operated an actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilla-sur-Seine, where he worked at that time.
In 2007, he also operated an actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of hematoma resulting from bleeding into the brain.
However, it is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times condemned in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
The Advocate of the medical chamber Olivier Metzner referred to him as a non-human, who is usually called before the medical chamber, and which cannot be recommended far from now.
After several days of silence with Dr. Stéphane Delajoux on Friday, he expressed the matter through his attorney David Kubbi.
He announced that the procedure had absolutely a good course - and post-operative examination was - normal -
The operation was not haemorrhagic, and therefore it was not necessary to introduce the wood, it added.
The health problems of the singer have been growing since this year, and in any case, it seems that another tour of the singer remains with the otasis.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the scheduled tour on 8 January (Amenens, I know. red.) appears to be too close, declared Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and calls on the side of Nouveau Centre not to use their shortcut anymore.
The UDF association, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt of the President of the Nouveau Centre, the Hervé Morin to take the short cut from the former Giscard side, with the fact that the short cut can't be used in any medium under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take up the UDF short with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her inheritance after he gave his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, was planning to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council on the movement of Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mr Hervé de Charetta (former za-UMP now for NC) who added ownership of the UDF brand because he first had it registered in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday night, the USF Association Committee of Managing Friends François Bayroua, who do not intend to stand up, stepped out of his silence and submitted a formal request to the Minister and the Members to stop using a short notice and forward ownership of the trade mark under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the alarming statement of proposing your political movement +from the resumption+ of the USF, writes the Association in its letter signed 19 those of the 24 members of the Committee, of which, for example, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, by MoD or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional material and on the welcome web page of your movement name+Nouveau centre+, with slogan +UDF today+, the signatories also present a letter.
As you are aware, you do not have any right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC movement to remove any mention of UDF's name from all promotional materials including (s) websites -
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette to transfer ownership to legal owners of the trade mark.
If you do not do so, we will appeal to the courts to be respected by the law and the legitimate rights of USF members, they will warn the signatories.
In their letter, the UDFs stated that it was a full political movement in 1978, and they recalled that Mr Morin and his friends had chosen to leave in 2007 to create a competitive movement as well as others in 2002 to start an UMP.
The movement of Nouveau centre therefore does not have a right to use the UDF shortcut (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they point out that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for the connection to MoD for three years and for the creation of a committee responsible for defending-moral and material interests, a association based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the Committee continues, when it registered a trademark, it was not a member of the UDF for three years, but a UMP.
The scandalous and fraudulent way of using a non-existent acronym registration to make it into its own account.
This improbability begins to change into criminal acts, they declare, and then irony speaks to the NC strategy: \"We believe that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for themselves than to step out of anonymity by accepting the name we do not have right to,\"
The case of Lilian Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged of abuse of the state of weakness.
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and to sentence whether he took advantage of the state of weakness of 80-year billionaires to prepare her for part of her fortune, which would blame her daughter Lilian Bettencourt.
Photographer (62 years), known by his famous photographs, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, which is a crime for which the penalty is imposed for a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This decision confirms that the process in the case will actually take place, which can be referred to as a family stake of one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter are fighting for the control of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered medical examinations of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by the College of three physicians.
Grandfather and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undertake such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State Representative in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 at the same time as to state whether Liliana Bettencourt could be found in the state of weakness and during which period.
I think he'll come up with it.
I'll talk to her about the matter, say after the hearing, the lawyer, Mrs. Bttencourt, Georges Kiejman.
With regard to attorney François Bettencourt-Meyer, Olivier Metzner, the court has welcomed that decision.
It's a great report(...). Expertise will show that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It is two years after the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt launched criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and ally who believe that for many years she has been using the state of weakness for her mother to receive a gift of billion euros in the form of checks, contracts for life insurance or pictures of masters.
Lilian Bettencourt always refused to be a photographer who considered to be a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court had to assess the legality of the action brought by Mrs Bttencourt-Meyer, the fifth case of lawyers had changed at times in the family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's attorney submitted three letters that his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) sent her notebook, and in which she expressed her distrust towards the husband François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Lilian Bettencourt delivered by the attorney, : ‘you could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier for fifteen years once and twice a day.
Since she got married, I could never speak to François
The State Representation in Nanterre once again found that the complainant's actions were not justified, even more so that the guardian's judge rejected her application to initiate the procedure for the issue of legal protection for her mother on these days.
Lilian Bettencourt is completely capable of participating in a court, is not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her, confirmed the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyer's claim to be valid at the time of the initiation of the trial.
Manager revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, the behaviour of management of large companies vis-à-vis employees of companies' access to consumers before marketing revolutions: this is to ensure that the co-workers identify themselves with ‘values’, which were designed from the mountain, as it was earlier when consumers had to impose products that came from ideas of the head of factory techniques.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the strategy for making the market in the right direction...and when authoritarian efforts to force products, different from customer preferences, they regularly return!
The passive approach of employees can lead to deadly demoralisation.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only visible parts of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which mainly interferes with managerial hulls.
This demobility adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI calls on all stakeholders... active approach and ability to predict - and requires employees to be fully opposed to the revenue of authoritarian management.
That is why we call on management revolution, which should aim at putting workers at the centre of the company's interest as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal polls in public opinion.
Internal surveys of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted by Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially since I've already convinced myself that the structure after different turnings will return priority to... what she's always done!
In addition, the authority, as one of the pathology of power, increases proportionately the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have mechanical interpretations of psychology.
Due to the mental comfort they have developed an old behaviorist theory, now reliving the uneurism of the United States and widely distributed without greater knowledge of scientific institutions and media.
With the possibility of moving (sic) managers' involvement, Ipsos' recent survey on Figaro.fr's website, which just confirms the management staff in their position of mechanical management, which is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, presupposes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in the inclusion of the basic observation into all the intentions and practices of management : For employees, commitments will only be possible to the undertaking if they appear to be a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of motivating employees is only concerned with the study of the Motivally functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a pre-defined dox that will enable them, through a picture that speaks of the undertaking, to assess what it offers them to achieve their lives objectives.
With the identification and measurement of these mobility factors, managers can control, predict and counter their social performances, and indicate their management of human resources on the right path.
This creates a live soil for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
By the expression of Oslo, “the righteous war“ served Obama with praise from the right hand.
The American right hand on Friday welcomed the speech that Barack Obama presented the day before that in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the holder of Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 advocated the concept of “legal war” against the enemies of the United States.
Consumers who first mocked Obama's award of the award of the award of the award of the award of the award to Obama on 9 October, this time the President's speech was favored, including Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidates in elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a muse of the right-wing republican wing, for the United States Today, and added that she had expressed her own need for this theme - war in her memories that were just coming out.
The war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorGeorge W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used his speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Other Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, determined that the President had done good work in Oslo,
I think that the speech was really good, congratulated former President of the House of Representatives, who, above all, appreciated the President's mention of “the existence of evil in the world”
In my own way, I considered this speech to be quite historical, declared Gingrich during the radio interview, The Takeaway,
A former Member, whom some consider as a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was thrilled to see the “levist president” - reminding members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price at peace if the use of force did not exist.
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of the speech George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented a great American speech.
Not only did he introduce himself as a “world - as always, but” he spoke as an American president - and reminded Europeans - that they live in a safe bubble they did not create themselves, and that they do not do too much to preserve it, he judged Gerson.
Several dissatisfactions from the right include Bush's era, former ambassador at the United Nations John Bolton, who referred to the expression as \"unique, blatant and without inspiration\", as he said on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is disappointed when looking at Barack Obama, as it justifys the use of force.
“When war is packed in a box of righteousness, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people - he warned.
However, the medium-levic press is holding a commendative opinion against the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the peace price to Obama as premature, it evaluated his output as a “excession” - even for the speaker known for his talent.
The message from Osla should serve as a guide to the international decision to resolve conflicts, in the fight against poverty and pressure, as a guide to the California daily.
Obama - presented a speech that needed to be - evaluated by the New York Times, and described the speech as simple and informative -
Road carriers: three maratons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three acting maratons, the road carriers and TLFs, the only employers' organisation that remained until the end, on Friday evening, to an agreement that completed the call for stasis and threat, which passed over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed its independence after several negotiations that began Wednesday morning.
After the second night, the negotiators started to discuss on Friday morning soon with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as quickly as possible by the end of the morning.
And even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meetings, which began at 11 o'clock to all agree and sign an agreement in 18 hours.
This conflict - would greatly harm businesses - and - would threaten to be affected by holidays at the end of the year - declared Bussereau.
The text contained an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest payments (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest payments (national transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest payments is increased from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9,06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort to do, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we give our members a command not to block, no storage center blocks.
But there may be several other opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, President TLF, welcomed the right agreement, even though it was difficult to admit an increase in high wages due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a agreement of sound sense and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the historic agreement -
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an acceptable compromise.
The agreement also foresees a 3 % revalorisation of travel expenditure and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for the 13th payment and modernisation of collective contracts to be addressed.
Bussereau recalled the reduction of EUR 100 million on corporate wages taxes, which was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 Budget Act, which was voted out of the Thursday for Friday of the National Assembly.
The government will request the Senate to vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organisation, later on to the entire field, in the case of the extension of the Ministry of Labour.
Realising in the shortest term, he assured Bussereau.
The whole process can only slow down the consent of employers' organisations.
The FNTR is talking about a \"bad trade\" because 100 million euros have been offered by the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to act in distress, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order to avoid the poisons of turkeys at the time of the coming Christmas holidays, he complained about Unostra.
For the organisation of Otre, the agreement in the next 12 months is likely to engulf large quantities of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field.
Railway trains RER A: interruption of transport on weekends, trade unions are not satisfied with the design of the transport company RATP.
The interruption of transport to the RER A line, which is the largest line of public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as the Friday negotiations between the trade unions and the RATP second day of the strike did not lead to any specific results in the question of premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. days of important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only drive between 10th and 20th hours, on the main section (limit La Défence and Nation) every other train, except for this section only one train from four.
The SNCF connection will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Gallery Lafayette business houses, expected every day over 200 000 customers welcomed the fact that the RATP was trying to secure a connection with large commercial homes.
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of Paris' aglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday there was a train in traffic from two and practically no set went out of the tip at the time as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France had arranged differently, and there was no confusion on the platform.
So early in the morning, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was at the station much less than usual, among other things, because there were no students and students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was up by an hour and a half earlier to be sure that he would arrive in time.
Saint-Lazare's route was not overrun, she announced to the State Railways SNCF, for he predicted a larger number of workers and officers of order.
Railway trains RER A operated by SNCF in direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arriving or departing from Saint-Lazare Station with a connection to the metro.
The next General Meetings will take place on Saturday and Sunday, on which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting will be evaluated with the lead that the unions have evaluated as ‘slabé’.
The RER headquarters proposes negotiations on a specific protocol for railway trains RER A on all pages, adjustments to working time, career progress, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who require a premium, according to Thierry Garon (RecruitmentJih).
RATP has even put off the premium proposals, which has worsened CGT with the fact that the management has not been able to solve the problem, while tourism carriers and SNCF have been able to resolve it.
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, will examine the conditions for the performance of the profession - specified by the transport undertakings RATP.
Which was why the unionmen thought they had a business - made fun of weekend passengers -
In the morning, about 150 drivers operated a business committee in his seat in Paris.
The management, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore, in the interest of calming, decided to meet.
There is a danger that the conflict will extend to the RER B line on Tuesday after Unsa and Independently notify the strike emergency.
The experts request a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Indépendants (Undependent) and make it difficult to work on this line that daily transports millions of passengers.
The railways of the suburban trains RER are awarded in a more advanced period of careers 2200 to 2700 euro gross wages and 600 to 650 euro premium for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the whore side, and this decision has severe consequences.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court decided to repeal the main pro-curidian party in the country. This decision immediately produced protest demonstrations in the Kurdian community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complication the task of the government, which seeks to give the Kurdic community a friendly hand and try to end the 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a “hazard of activities threatening the independence of the state and its Sunday unity”, said the journalists of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic after four days of the negotiations.
The decision was unanimously adopted by 11 Judges, when most votes were needed for the deployment of the Party, Kiliç said that 37 parties, including its President Ahmet Türek and Ambassador Aysely Tugluková, had a ban on taking part in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity that Mr Türk and Mrs Tuglucova used and the confiscation of the property of the Party by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 chairs in Parliament (from 500).
The Governing Board pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Board of Appeal, Abdulahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP from obedience to the ‘commands’ of the Working Party of the Presidents of Justice (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider terrorist organisations.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political victim of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that there is no ‘basic link with PKK’, but refuses to mark it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Verdict of the court comes at the moment that the government provides a friendly and friendly community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and seeks to limit the support of the Kurds to the PKK and to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a recovery of tension on the south-east of Anatoly, where many demonstrations have been rejected in recent weeks against the conditions behind which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcane has been held in clashes with the police.
Since the notification of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before DTP in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, which is predominantly the Kurds.
The police used tear grenades and water cannons, demonstrators threw Molotov's cocktails or shot stones from the washing machines.
She also demonstrated a hundred people in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of righteousness only deepens desperateness.
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurdů, Čr. red.) by banning the party, declared in the press.
The government, consisting of a party, came from an Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're a principle against interference.
It doesn't matter, he declared the Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete reflection of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented on the political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Obviously, we can wait for a reaction from PKK, added.
On Thursday, PKK applied to one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, who killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
Snow can come
It's a good-looking winter, that's what Wolfgang Braubburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, he says the Head of the FES Technical Services Winter Department.
But so his employees can try and learn to control all the car technology.
This weekend could happen for the first time according to meteorologists.
There are over 300 employees and 120 vehicles ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt on the ground and the temperatures fall below zero, they leave on 20 so-called sections and large-scalers, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit moves such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the arrivals for firefighters, lines of public transport, pedestrian zones and sectiones with a drop like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to rub a damp salt that holds better within three hours, something about 1040 kilometres.
That is why the FES starts at three hours at night to be free road when it starts transporting to employment -
It's hard when it starts to snow at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the Head of the Technical Services Winter Department, - because no one is willing to make a seat for the snipers -
Only when they don't eat so much, they're on a range of arrivals and communications, including Rat-Beil-Straß.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
Five o'clock in the morning, they're going on FES' journey, they're primarily cleaning dangerous places and transitions.
The FES can't usually take care of all cyclosis.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that monitors from 22 to 4.30 above all bridges, says Braubburger.
As the ice-creams are quickly formed, the spray is coming out immediately as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaur collage
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal's long two metres and the 1.50 metres high was running after two strong rear limbs, had a lengthy skull with sharp, bent teeth, short front limbs with splinters and long tails.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth edition of Science writes that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these physical signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was found in the mooring dry area of the Pange supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the incoming relationships, the expansion and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt began and other paleontologists with excavations at Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, it's unwelcome for trias, informs the member of the Randall Irmis team of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the diggers, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of early dinosaur history.
Name - Tawa - comes from the Sun god of the Indians of Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitta it is an unusual find: ‘Fosilie dinosaurs from triass are very rare, mostly only one fragments are found.
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservations.
Especially the sensational finding is not, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
In the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
A lot of the oldest fossils are not complete, so it is usually disputed to assign pradinosaurs.
Experts are discussing, for example, when the others split into three most important development lines: carnivorous terrapods, which later belonged to Tyransaurus rex, Velociraptor and birds, long-term birds, four-day sauropods, and their relatives, and the bulls of Ornithischia (ptakopane), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after the analysis of Nesbitta and his colleagues of the original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On Tawa hallae's skull, researchers, for example, found evidence of the air bags that also have the progeny of terrapods of birds.
Thanks to the atmosphere, breathing of birds is more effective than mammals.
The bones of the spine were obviously partly filled with air at Tawa Hallae.
Tawa's the oldest and most primitive terror with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of huge sauropods had later also air vacuums and light bones, they probably created this useful innovation in front of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the famous most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists were making their first appearance there.
According to this, three development lines have already split up early and spread from South America to all continents which, at the time, were a supercontinent of Pangea, formed by a single Earth mass.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found two others along with Tawa hallae, not especially close to the relatives of the terrapods.
These three can't come from one common, Immigrant foreman, they're arguing with scientists.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of scientific studies.
Of course there are also differences.
One other older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonský paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could put together a fragmented picture, because in South America there remained very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, rarely on other continents.
How the dinosaurs have proven to have developed from a relatively rare side line of the pleural family to governing vertebrates on the ground in times of the Earth’s Middle Ages, it remains an argument.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their life space with many other posters, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying ligaments and countless other more.
With the end of the triass, dinosaurs have spread to the world and many new species have evolved, while relatives have died and the triass and jury interface.
Success stories never lasted forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass espionage that the dinosaurs may have survived, but not a plague.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could have pushed the competitors out.
History of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, he helped the meteorite impact of another group of animals, which has so developed in trias and lived since in the shadow: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and signatories are international.
There are professors at University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
They joined the grants from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Brem.
The police clearance of the occupied Franfurtian Goethe University took care of a global break.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, but also colleges across Germany, Europe and North America, have solidarity with protesting students in Westend campus.
In a statement written by German and English, they do not approve, presided by a police intervention.
Because the walls and artistic works were cold, werner Müller-Estler left the university president to clear the building that they occupied last week of staging students and lectures.
At the same time, five students were injured.
The damage to things, the signatories, do not justify the violent dissolution of self-organised teaching by students and teaching police commissions.
Exclusion represents an unacceptable intervention for freedom of research and science.
The rewarding focus on vandalism is used for the illegality and criminalisation of the protest - and reflects attention from the content.
The Presidency avoided the necessary discussions.
The speakers call for the suspension of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers have not supported material damage.
Correct protest
In addition, the youth organisations of Verdi and the German trade union are solidarityd with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for his own future, says the mysterious Earth youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hesen Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is currently defending the process of the universal president and police.
We are grateful to the University President.
The destruction and detention are completely unacceptable, she said on Thursday at Actuellen Stunde (Actual Hour) in Wiesbadenian Dream.
We have an understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said the messenger to the Earth's dream for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition factions of the SPD, Greens and Linke.
The CDU takes painted walls for an excuse to criminalise protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, there was an outburst.
Linke has submitted a proposal that calls on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
New Silicone-Valley
Long summers paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenagrad, one of the ten districts of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where secret armed research was carried out.
Today, this period with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre, is considered to be the ‘Silicon Valley’ of Russia.
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and manufacturing centres.
Since September 2008, Zelenograd representatives have established contacts with the French scientific centre Riedberg - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were made and signed at Frankfurt Zenograd and Ridberg at the Centre for close cooperation.
Russian delegates led the Moscow multistarst Jurij Rosljak and prefect from the Zenograd Anatoli Smirnov, for Frankfurt signed the Head of Planning Reference Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural research at the seminar to Zenograd will be held.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
This is also about economic relations.
The FIZ companies will be able to touch the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenagrad is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the Grand Concilient Sitronics and Rossijskai Electronics.
The period was established in 1958 as so-called “socialist planed city” for armed research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation of the Green City) has acquired its name by forested hilly landscapes to which research facilities are established.
Stuttgart brake
Dimenze Stutgart 21 can't be prepared enough.
It is quite simply the new heart of Europe for the supporters of the project;
All right. S21 is more than the launch of the station, more than a monstrous construction that will decommission the capital of Baden-Württemberg for one decade into desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, the main stations with railways which ended in the city centre were considered to be a transport-technical fossil of the 19th century, which act as brake of modern rail transport because it needed an enormously many time to move the locomotive back forward.
Take a moment to stop, go on, so it should work.
That's why the main station goes off: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Huttgart: the railway station, which lies approximately halfway across the route of the trans-European railway magistrals between Paris and Budapest/Bratislav - that is why the slogan about the heart of Europe - is the only one in which it is located.
It really begins with S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Very ambitious designers themselves have learned that it is almost unfunded in the Hesen and Bavarian capital.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles on both ends, the main station no longer has problems with riding and driving.
Yet: Stuttgart 21 begins including a new line of ICE to Ulm.
They put it on the ground and the municipal politicians.
The measures are cooperating, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by a tax payer and not by a state-owned company.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we believe computer images of designers - it will contain many greens.
S21 is harmful to the railway system.
The railway station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which is typically in the 1980s - attributed a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights at the time.
Modern transport policy has to go first and foremost to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more green than freight road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to a sharp climb.
Even more serious is that S21 is indirectly affecting a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were supposed to be buried in Switzerland.
That's an official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be no funding for further node points and a narrow spot on the network.
There are 60 bigger projects on the Transport Ministry list.
One of the most important ones is the construction of approximately 180 kilometres long route by the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, a slow pace has been set on this route.
There would have to be a lot of pressure.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The track by the River Valley will become a throat of the bottle of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine its judgment on the airport
The Land Government had opened up in Wiesbadenian Land if it would go against the judgment of the Hesen Court of Justice (VGH) concerning the ban on the night years and let him review it.
CDU/FDP Coalition has been entrusted by experts to legally assess more than 400 Ms. VGH’s judgment, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today in writing justified that, in the case of construction, the State had to amend the night ban on flights planned by the North West Bank.
The permission of 17 years between the 23rd and 5th hour, as the Land Government assumes, does not comply with the law imposed by the protection of the population against night air noise.
The Coalition must be decided by 4 January if it requires revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and led to the government's representative to close the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Lipsk.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to promises regarding the ban on the night years which she gave before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate it as “distortion of the word”,
It's bloody difficult if you can keep your word, said Chief Green Tarek Al-Wazir in an insult to the election slogan FDP -We keep our word -
Minister Posch refused to pay tribute to Schäfer-Gümbel, the Land government is trying to get through the “recruitment of rights and tricks” to its night years.
The exact legal check needs its time.
Koalice does not want to work on the basis of the early first income -
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller.
The statements of his fraction to ban nights have never been the same as the opposition.
The US Bank pays the aid
The American, the crisis of a shocking large bank is decommissioned by the state bond.
At the same time, the Bank of America paid on Wednesday assistance from the bank rescue fund Tarp amounting to $45 billion (about €30 billion).
According to the report from the United States Station, CNBC plans to repay state aid also Citigroup.
Thus, the Constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that occurred by accepting money - the limitation of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
A bank of America took $19 billion of clean cash with investors.
The rest of the amount was taken from its register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trades.
The head of Kenneth Lewis, on Wednesday night, specifically thanked the American tax payer: Penalse's injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The money institution damaged at the top of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment banks.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the State by providing money on the capital market.
The CNB informed with its appeal to resources that the US bank could have announced on Thursday the capital increase of around $20 billion.
Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to express himself to that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid their help.
Quick option
It was just faster than expected.
The station introduced its successor two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the director Nikolaus Brender out of the office.
Last night, the grememium wanted to agree on this person.
Peter Frey, ZDF's head of study in Berlin's capital.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially so that the process would not lead.
However, the role could also have been played by not wanting to harm ZDF authorising officer Markus Schächter if he did not pass this proposal with the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine support from 14 members of the game.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter’s board of directors took his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although she could have been expected.
The EU majority in the Board has been signaling several weeks before the elections that they do not want to confirm Brender at the office.
Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch organized resistance to the head editor.
He refused to continue in the office of a highly-weighted editor, by the argument that Brender's monitoring quotas for ZDF's news broadcasts have fallen.
Thus, until shortly before the election, protests were critical of the political impact on the ZDF.
Last time, 35 state-owned lawyers were involved in the debate, who would evaluate Koch's procedure as counter-restruction.
It wasn't useless.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogism and romance.
Then he worked for Südwest Fun and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 moved Frey to ZDF, first to the “heute-journey Journal”
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 Personal Reference from the Head of the Editorial; 1991/92 a correspondent in Washington; until 1998 the Head and moderator-Morgenmagazines; until 2001 the Head of Foreign Policy of the ZDF; since then Head of the ZDF major studio.
After Brender, who was elected as a specialist member of the Medium Magazine journalist of the year, was established, announced to the Greens that they would file a constitutional action.
Koch's anti-candidacy in the Board of Directors, the Rhine-Follow Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Lands should change their state contract with the ZDF so that the personnel proposals of the authorising officer could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Council.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, was dealt with by a smart chess move - immediately after Brender's deployment, criticized him for that strongly.
Thanks to this evidence of the journalistic independence, he could have nominated him instead of the editor-in-chief without losing his face as Schächter, so he could be voted by the board without suspecting that the party would be pushed to the office.
There's Frey in the partial arithmics, and there's no such thing as left-wing liberals.
The studio gets rid of the harpadas
Part-time success for students: After one year of strike they finally entered the Federal Countries Minister of Culture: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both parties agreed that they would be willing to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the load of tests: A single test should be completed by each study module.
In addition, the working burdens of students should be reviewed and a genuine and defenceable peace should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The partner countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural award for the Balkan and Master’s Study Area.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the opening of students' protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have had words of better study in their mouth.
Now they are first filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation board has established that the number of tests in part is drastically reduced: ‘Every module will normally be completed only one test - it is written in a 30-page report, which is expected to partially regulate the approval of studies.
The President of the Reinhold Grimm's accreditation Board, said, is to be put to a halt in the error of development, which significantly reduced the complexity of the studies.
To this end, the diversity of studies - in the future - should be a decisive criterion - in the implementation.
The modules and content must be carefully rechecked in order not to limit studies in the election
seminars -
Students should take a year to the space that allows and supports their own initiative -
The rules are to apply in the approval of new studies, after examination, but also for existing studies.
These needs to be re-credited for every five years, but this means that it will take until 2015, before all study subjects will be reviewed.
All over Germany, the ten accreditation agencies, which are subject to accreditation advice set up by the Federal Countries, are responsible.
The Ministers of Culture called in October - in particular - the Federal countries to work on agencies so that the filling of the work was not too big and the testing regime was not strict.
In each association country, universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures with the Earth ministry.
As the only country has promised the Rhine-Falcko additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
Out of money, colleges should primarily pay consultation programmes and study advice and strengthen the test and foreign authorities.
That's what the country and college want to spend ten million euros on it.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to refer to Parliament to the amendment of the Law of Higher Education.
According to her, only one single test should be needed to complete the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, thus ensuring the recognition of tests from other universities and making it easier for the master to be made available.
By the end of next year, the difficulty of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition reassessed on the country’s study conditions.
In addition to praise, the criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Joint Board of Higher Education Groups called for the development of education policy not to play in the future, for closed doors, ministers and university Rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students as the persons concerned should speak at least a word about it.
Future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: “We need students’ experience” on Thursday at one meeting with the ministers of culture, with which HRK consulted on the joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW) there was not a Bonn resolution sufficiently far away: They require a legal claim that would allow any graduate with the Bactal degree to access the construction Master's studies.
Secondly, the federal countries must ensure that, for today's generation of students, there are plenty of places in the master study fields with the best study conditions, said a member of the Board of Directors of GEW Andreas Keller.
The Federal countries must employ far more professionals.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their free access to Master's programs.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control - sounds the opening line of one poet Werner Söllner, who has also lost his language environment in this broken language piece.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, first worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a tutor of one book publisher, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan.
Söllner was awarded various literary prices, 1993 presented poetry at the legendary francfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesen Board of Literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he took care of a considerable inseparation in Munich, which was a German literature in Romania in the mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts.
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in which, in front of colleagues, the writer of Romanian Germans, Richard Wagner, William Totek, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Fraundorfer, confesses to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Secure.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language price in 1989.
The attempts to recruit said they began inadvertently, first in 1971.
I am, continued by Söllner, then someone who did not resist enough attempts to intimidate the Securitate party.
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and its unconditional literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is a literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania, shakes the case that marks the depths and disgrace of the political system, which is based on checks and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the state of knowledge, just a perp, but he's also a victim.
In the acts of Security, Walter's secret agent played some role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel, and he referred to the positive influence of Agent Walter's secret agent.
“He cut me off,” says Markel at all the points he had to do with it.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in this form and not expected before this publication, but the absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller has already written in July when she read her own files, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for ecclesiastes.
Grants, you can assume, they'll be speculating, and in some cases, they'll probably know which name hides behind the cover of Sorin, Voic and Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime, there is a very certain examination of Stazi's components, handling with the rest of the Securitate control is still very dissolution.
In recent years, systematic light has been dreamt and limited.
One of the Birthing authorities, which corresponds to the National Council to the processing of the components of the Security (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act has been more lengthy since then.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing file management.
That the former members of the Security Committee still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, one interview in which one of Securitate's former bosses of Temesvar expressed their opposition to the awarder.
He said that my psyche, after all, was questioned only once.
The sense of power has been expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in the context of the silenced commission, raises inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession is expected to be determined by the continuation of this chapter by the desire for knowledge rather than by the commandment of guilt and shame.
The genezi of Herty Müller's work, which she accepted yesterday's Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote.
Nasty deposit of Champions League
It seemed like a clean-dressed sales representative from a cute Christmas party where he gave up the producer of sports goods of candy when he entered a quarter of an hour after midnight into the attached mercedes class C new coach VfB Christian Gross accompanied by an orange dyed bag sponsor.
A man with a brandy skin had a foreign town run after him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and drunk luck was a 55-year-old man, too.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow he'll continue working.
Or it'll just start.
The words were only three days of the commitment of Switzerland: “We have achieved eight-years, namely in Champions League due to the victory3:1 above Unire Urziceni from Romania, but we must not let ourselves be successful with success: It will be brutally hard to fight against the convention”
“The next more important task is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in May even in the ordinary league day.
And to avoid reinvigorating the obvious weaknesses after three rapid goals of Marilyn (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrobnyak (11.).
Losing
The Olympic Champions League (playing 16/17. + 23/24 February/Returning 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be won on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the staggering start of Babylon’s successor will therefore remain preserved.
Not only in the alleged healer, who provided insecure jettgart professionals with confidence during a short period of time, willingness to set up and enjoy the game.
I went to the players, and I told them to focus on their strengths, and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the healer of the Souls Gross so easily sounding successful recipe, which did not prove any more effective after the effects of a therapist Babbel.
He divulged a certain magic, admitted to Babbel’s leader Jens Lehmann, “when a new impulse comes in football, things happen that you would not consider possible”
And Sami Khedir, who, after a many weeks break caused by injury, became the best player on the field due to his dynamics, tried to describe the identified \"fenomén\" - a literal - fresh wind - and working procedures of the new superior:\"This is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation -
Apparently it was missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns the sports president Horst Hedt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, they don't want players and managers to overestimate the victory against the weakened spare and completely overloaded defense of a Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after defeat 0:4 in Leverkusen, considering Khedir.
And the sports president Horst Heldt pointed out that although one goal had been achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt didn't celebrate his 40th birthday after the first home victory after three months was caused by weekend events that had been freshly experienced in the form of a television conversation with the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that act others and not Jens have taken Heldt to the hard Lehmann critic.
He set up the board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of teenage fans.
Even the fact that he was disturbed by his free day after the games, Lehmann marked him as a sign of the missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann’s statements “forms pure egoism,” said Heldt and announced a convention for goalkeepers.
I don't think these 40-year-olds will have any joy in their lives anymore.
Anyway, they're all for one thing that without the work of a trained coach team, it wouldn't be possible to play such a competitively strong and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a great share of success, saying Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with an igelite bag agrees.
Fighting World Championships in heavy weight
A passionate duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson has constantly provoked the words and gestures of Master of the World of Vitalia Klička.
However, after twelve hard wheels, Ukrainian advocated his title in the heavyweight of WBC's boxing organization.
The referee's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klička remains the world champion in a heavy weight box.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday at Berna Johnson unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klička it is the third successful defence title after its return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukrainian was the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't end to a.o. that everyone expected.
Klička improved his balance to 39 victory in 41 professional combats, twice he was defeated due to injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
About 17,000 viewers in the Berlin arena drove 2,02 meters high Klička battle mainly with his left.
By 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Kličva era before the duel, but downloaded himself before the punch of the world master, so Klička couldn't set up a decisive blow against his dangerous right.
He's done pretty much passive Johnson on the challenger and he's just trying to get into the next rounds.
Although Klička provoked words and gestures, his punches, but the world's masters were only a few times.
But it's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klikek full of 12 rounds.
The challenger took care of himself before the fight in the Swiss capital about the breakup.
He insulted Klička as a “resistant zombie” that is not well -
During his weight on Friday, he had the champion provoked, pulled Johnson off his nose with sunglasses, - so he could see his eyes -
Fourth victory after Return
The Klička remained undefeated after its return on October 11, 2008.
After nearly a four-year break then he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his own WBC belt, which had to give up without a fight before it.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically I was in good shape, justified the Klička to quickly return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in his family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA is wearing but the British David Haye, after he sat off the throne in November 2,13 metres high Nikolay Vulajev.
Haye cut off a fight against Kličko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
He's supposed to be a pro-motive company against Kličk in Wembley Stadium London.
The case of Kunduzu
The head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction was called for poor information about the Kundúz Minister of Defence Guttenberg's affair.
SPD and Links (Levice) call for a chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the raid on Kundúz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a conscious error.
Minister for the death bombardment of two tankers in September said: “Inadvertently,” said the head of the faction of the Green Jürgen Trittin in the Saturday's report show, \"ARD-Tagasschau\",
Let's call it the usual expression: Lhal.
The order to kill was issued in non-compliance with the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the nature of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday it appeared that the attack was not only about the destruction of the stolen trucks, but of the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In an American raid required by the German commander, Colonel Klein, was killed or injured by up to 142 people according to NATO's investigation.
Greens, SPD and Linked called on Saturday for the Greek Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately express themselves before the Spolková snow and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan Federal Dream Policy - and if the Office of Chancellors, Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, they invited Jürgen Trittin and co-workers from the Green Renate Künast.
The spokesperson of Ulrich Wilhelm definitely refused criticism.
The office of Chancellor has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also many doubts about the mandate of the Ministry on the basis of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, both Guttenberg's two were properly informed about the background of the attack on the tank.
It officially sounded that they had to deny NATO's existence and silence the Minister's sensitive details.
However, it was noted from the vicinity of both top officials that the Ministry of Defence even pointed out several reports between them on Colonel Klein's bipage document and one military police report.
“Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagsheitung” reports that Wichert had to ask in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any response yet.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the attacks and pointed out that this would be addressed in the investigation committee of the Spolk House, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in the white state and hear voices that others don't see and hear.
Not only do the psychologically ill or drug-related lines link between immigration and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we're lying with closed eyes in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and imaginations.
But whoever is experiencing new conditions in the divinity, sees and hears things that others don't see and hear, usually pays for a fool or a drug addict in today's Western world or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices do not appear only in mentally ill or drug-related.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, here and there will make sure that they split the border between dreams, imagination and reality.
Dreams of changed consciousness can occur in different forms, in better cases we call them visions, in worse error.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the vision of the Hildegard von Bingen mystics, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanda, Shamanian condition of delusion, mentalosis and hallucinations can be separated from similar processes.
Hallucination or vision will occur if the balance of neural brain transfusions occurs - mostly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is broken.
Comprehensive hallucinations and foolish thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic mentalosis.
Gravity over him doesn't have much power
The relationship between delusion and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since the antiques.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a dream form in the white state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, was a great similarity with dream states in 1861 - for Sigmunda Freud was a dream even of “psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, lying senses”
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is double-dimensional and curved color.
Gravity over him has no power, rises up at the ceiling of the room.
He smells like a kick.
Behind him winged black characters with bloody red grimas, precious teeth.
They kick him, they kick him with heavy fire shoes, throw him about the wall, they feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices are at risk from the wall and from the radio.
He can't bear the voices they're giving him and they're insulting him anymore.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, plugs them in the loop and straps it on the hook on the ceiling.
He's gonna stand on one speaker, and he's gonna have a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn from the congregation’s voices by tearing out the drums, go to the clinic and let them heal.
Today henningu T. 40 years ago, he experienced six acute psyches, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizofect paranoia, and besides, he's maniodepressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, three years he's married.
I've seen the worst fear and the deepest doubt in my psyche, he says.
Miracles are a terrible fact
Probably one percent of people get sick at least once their life, in psychiatric clinics, it's the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psyches, the disabled cannot distinguish most of the inner and outer world, they have a resolute condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or illusions of persecution.
Particularly extended is the hearing of the voices - the votes they order, comment, or lead dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The injured is unable to distinguish the important of the insignificant, the brain cannot filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is flooded into the houses.
Just like the dream opens up the psyche of a flood of thought and imagination that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in mentalosis is focused on subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Doctor Klinika of the General Psychology of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has the meaning of it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, overreached by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenic therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible for them, the wonders are a terrible fact, the awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, experience hallucinations
Other than in a dream, says Fuchss, “but there is a sensory and spatial structure of the reality that a person perceives in a psychic, essentially preserved”
Deploy thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, and the loss occurs within a real framework.
The scientist is still standing in front of the argument, why our brain makes such a mess.
Exceptional states can lead to a short-term loss of relation to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone's going to get psycho.
It appears that there is a genetic exposure to Schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists say the affected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development, neurological brain damage, such as maternal viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But she remains an argument about how the neurological system breaks, which hasn't shown up in years.
Roles also play the effects of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experience can be an initiator of the mentalosis if there is a disposition.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger a psychic because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain is warmed up
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive meditations, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If the delusions feel as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and glides for ten years, interpreting his results in the book “Diie irreale Welt in unser Kopf” (The New World in our head last year).
Although halucination belongs to typical accompanying phenomena of the psyche, it is also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as border personality or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or cerebral trauma.
She's surprisingly hallucinating under certain conditions and the brain of a healthy person himself.
Halucination, according to Kasten, consists of the content of the ideas that are normally being oppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which the sensory perception is processed are too active or little depressed; if our brain is warmed up or when the stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also to remove stimuli, stress, love worry or other exceptional states.
In the newer studies, she reported up to three times that at least once in their lives had a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 is living in a small town in Meklenbursk-Primary Pomeranian and going to that gymnasium.
A completely normal girl, actually.
If there weren't those paintings and voices.
It could happen that they're going to address her with long, dark hair.
When he answers, there's no one who can see her but her, and they can't hear this boy.
This shy girl sees a broken dream, but Sarah K doesn't eat, she knows.
He's awake, he hears and sees this boy, just like he hears and sees a girl sitting next to herself in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a pleasant feeling. She likes that boy.
I'm crazy, he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other superhumans are not real and he'll disappear again.
In the night, the images are rather depressing.
Often there are excess loads.
When he sits in class, he can't watch how many lessons he learns, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else in the mathematical equation.
In the night, the images are rather depressing.
When she's waiting in her dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, she can often distinguish if she's awake or if she's asleep, whether the images she sees, grimasy, or a girl with bleeding cutting wounds on her hands and legs rise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at those characters.
The parents and friends don't say anything about it, they'd think she'd gone mad.
In the middle of 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Last year, she made her graduation and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since psychologist Kasten contacted the internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't lost her mind.
Translations are also art from desperation
If anyone is socially isolated or is taken by stimuli, he will have a high probability of hallucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have a job then, and he's taking care of his own fun.
Sarah K., the only one, had fear of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man that Dad used to call from when she thought was not her own father.
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected by Sarah K. to distinguish from each other the blues and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that let the brain rise, therefore it actually works--
Also night dreams evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people does not differ substantially from hallucinations in acute mentalosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically, people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Therefore, Kasten advises his patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border condition between sleep and hallucination
In our world, concentrated too much consciousness is unfortunately mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of Psychiatric and psychotherapy clinics of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, severe illness, but also brings positive, creativity - the population is also an art of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneroid form of experiences, a special form of changed consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which the concerned considers to be real and cannot distinguish them in a retrograde way from the white state.
Oneiroid status of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as polyradic inflammation patients who experience complete awareness of motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, like a lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of border state between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality there is no way to handle a situation, there will be a change in the worlds, but the real situation will be conscious.
An intensive form of support for senses and the transfer of senses in some inconceivable situation that enables us to move to loss of consciousness at the moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Peter Cornelius Clausen also describes his oneroid experience in his book “Herwiechsel” (Herzwechsel Heart) as a lifelong operation of the soul.
He was 49 years old when heart failure with subsequent heart transplants gave his consciousness on a few days' journey, and his body was lying constantly on an intensive care unit.
Clausen went into the world that he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man strapped to a bed in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles, which makes the taste of the blood.
On a motorcycle, the Greek will take him to his country, surf on a firna in the Alps and meet the Korean mob.
It goes completely into the imaginary history, everything is real, and later in memories.
These inner paths differ significantly from any dream to Claussen.
Sen is a different state, describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams there are memories of these mental paths even after years and in essential details clearly clear.
Even clearer and more intense than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience is breaking the horizon of our other real experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show oneiroid states, psyches, hallucinations and drug connections, how fragile are our inner images of external reality in the dark state.
Any change in consciousness, including psychologist Kasten, can lead to a deformation of what we call reality,
The fact that can also be enriched.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 they are supposed to take the publishing children's children
The new manager of Kallen's publishing is a temporary solution: He long-term wants Hubert Burda to transfer his business to the hands of his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding also has a 100 percent family in the future.
Hamburg - The founder Hubert Burda sees his business for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a firm will to enter the company, says 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We discussed the details carefully.
The question is, if they're active in the company, they're counted after.
And the question is if they have the skills to do it.
It is not possible to build 7500 employees of your children if they are not able enough.
It would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been withdrawing from the board’s presidency since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burdy since 1999.
First he was in charge of technology.
Later, she added responsibility for the company's assets and after the withdrawal of Jürgen Todenhöfera also direct marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are at the head of the publisher.
Burd's kids are 19 and 17, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name also serves for us to “cold ten, 15 years,” Burd said.
Holding should have a 100 percent family in the future, says Burda.
In view of Schickedanz and Schaeffer's case, Burda expressed that even family businesses had no guarantee before their disappearance: ‘It always happened to companies that had been ordered by the capital they were speculating and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had a world power - said Burda.
I don't feel like the political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play the world's league with “Time” - these shops are too big.

Christmas is coming, and this is the time when it is appropriate to find out what the celebrity wears, and to adjust to it also its solemn wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which is necessary to be aware.
We're making some proposals.
Fergie chose extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend it.
Endesa and Barcelona, with an electric car
The Energy Society Endes and the Barcelona Council set up 'LIVE Chancellor'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electromobility in the capital of Catalana.
The LIVE Office will establish and operate a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and ensure mobility agreements, coordinate, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote electromobility, collect views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 'Electric City'
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be included in the project for the introduction of electric vehicles in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
This is the three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan Government.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Area.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative to participate in Endesa as regards the enforcement of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and has actively implemented a number of additional projects e.g.G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the cleaning period for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, awaits the cleaning period -
In the 2009 Prime Minister's economic report Zapatero summarised the measures that have been introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
\"Without the competitive plan for the automotive sector today, we would expect a state of release, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies,\" the Prime Minister said.
“With this plan and the wishes of individual brands, it continues to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, it is expected that a certain period of peace is expected for the industry, which is our main export sector, has added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Car Sector Plan (PIA), set 800 million for projects 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised investments exceeding 3 billion Eur.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government aid measures and mentioned a plan of 2000E, which was applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President's statement, this plan allowed 6% of the average emissions to be reduced in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and provided a significant increase in registrations, namely in November by-40 percent.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Hall of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is an area for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on 5 and 7 February 2010 in the Glass Hall of Madrid Casa de Campo.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, with more than 200 local and foreign exhibitors being represented.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid the same will all kinds of products related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products relating to classical engines, genuine bottles for collectors and curiosity.
Among the participating companies will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Franceco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cocher Closicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Eligibility tests in the exterior

Mazda3 i-Stop: maintenance of sports style
The Mazda intends to show that the attractiveness of the surrounding environment has no negative influence on the sports style.
Therefore, Mazda3 also has a built-in system to stop and start the engine - also baptized as i-Stop-, which is a device currently available only with gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation is characterised by good characteristics achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle design, population, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats of the driver’s seat have excellent ergonomics and are well-adjusted.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
With the tool and console compilations we will conclude that the Mazda continues in the Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style that also presents Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the soberness of German products and specifically more with Volkswagen Golf, who all want to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish very comfortable driving.
Moreover, large luggage space and regular shapes need to be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start-up system is currently only available with a petrol engine for two litres and 150 horsepowers as well as a manual transmission.
This engine is a real bottle. It is very fine, it is characterised by a reduced noise, performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not arrive so many kilometres per year should not rule out this i-Stop with the gasoline engine, as it is characterised by greater comfort during driving and reduced consumption.
As regards equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the system of monitoring of driving lanes (RVM) which prevents the creation of a dead angle, pull and stability control, speed control, inner mirror sensitive to light, onboard computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, sensor rain and light, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels from 17palc alloys.
And if the equipment were not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, with a surcharge of EUR 1.500: Adaptive two-xene and BOSE audio system with CD holder, except for other parts.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most complex cars in its category.
It is mainly indicated in the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not get more kilometres per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with gasoline engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR 21.770 for Luxura and EUR 23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large amount of satisfaction for every day.
Luxurious 'Premier'
L.A. has red carpet, fine as the hands of Penélop Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in new elegant and sexy models of brand'Nine.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, is used only to view mail, without being able to view certain types of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine evaluated him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him outside, but this idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payment, less than half the amount paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanent free data service, for which it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
The FonPeek, which was introduced last night to the Le Web event, is a European version of invention and at the same time its third turn.
It is limited just like his American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price amounts to around EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People with smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or to search for a café with WiFi (or a Fon connection) so that they can look for mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, you would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have an effect.
There is a major concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff, means that operators are starting to think differently and consider different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers a download of books and more search on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This facility is connected and applies when purchased, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case ofFonPeek, it's the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the phone mail, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's the best type in consumer terms.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The color Michelle adores
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first ladies of the United States.
In order to get Barack Obama into the function of the US president, she chose to dress and coat in this color, the same color also chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: handing over the Nobel peace price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to the fact that it is similar to color - yellow green with flammable effects--, in both cases it was a three-piece set - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric- decorated with a large height or collar.
At first sight, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Asturia Princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of taking part in Michelle’s function, she used a large lace, in Oslo alone with a print.
Changes also accessories: green shoes with moderately high heels, now similar model, but in gold color.
He wears various hairstyles: this timedrdol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have working problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger years who are worthy to take a child.
This is the result of the study 'The integrity and working career of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged between 15 and 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of partnership, there are many differences in the views of the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their home work on part-time or have no stable jobs start living with their partner earlier, before they give birth to their first child and they have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner life and motherhood postpone and have fewer offspring.
Women from 35 to 49 years of stable employment have had their first child on average 3.7 years since the beginning of their partnership with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted their stable employment to a greater part of their lives and have therefore had to postpone their partner use as well as the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the start time of life with a partner, explains Margarita Delgado, which focuses on research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and birth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age the women are married and having their first child.
Differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, between 35 and 49 years of age, women with primary and higher education had their first child aged 25.1 or 32.1.
“There is still another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education are married and they will give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education tend to take advantage of getting a stable job before marriage and the birth of their first child, reports Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, German actress will face various products of this brand under the universal password 'Because I am worth it'.
The representative of the 'Joyeux Noël', one of the more illegal actors of the international level, is added to another famous L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope Cruz.
Before her, they entered this selected actress Evangeline Lilly ('Rehabilitation' and Freud Pinto ('Milionary from the hut').
The Czech part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by important characters:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy' and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'The Lost').
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to talk about fashion issues.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and most recent - gathered at the annual price transfer held in London, at theRoyal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former Jerry Hall model and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents thirty x-ray films of writers with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases also in his everyday life).
He does not do so in dressed and predictable genres (biographic similarity, life and work), but he seeks something similar to that of creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent does not save the strokes or inspirations.
This book is an excellent reader’s request, even with repeated reading.
Here's some insights.
About Albert Camus: “On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, just as I feel, but it cannot be named: the pleasure of the anti-sugar, the morals without guilt and innocence without any god--
Samuel Beckett: “Nihilista, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not his mind, something between powerlessness and knowledge, with a blinding poetic humor, no sense as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him. ”
About Graham Green: “Our man has been committed to passion for this woman for the whole thirteen years,cisolism, pleasure and regret, which is a spiritual privilege to achieve heaven through the way of hell.
About James Joyce: “This Odyssea published in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight-month peaks in universal literature, which is to be overcome from the northern side, from which the best climbers are often killed.
William Faulkner: “He was a strange man.
About himself, he said he was an heir of a camper from the county, another time again that he was the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was about the great dreams -
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer has captured this man from Munich on the bridge, to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing himself before himself and calling to the future and far-reaching worms.
About Dorothy Parker: \"One has gone on and prayed, \"God my beloved, let me stop writing as a woman.\"
About Joseph Conrad: “There were Spenser’s verses on his grave: 'After the struggle, there will come a dream,/after the storm a peaceful port,/after the war rest,/after the full life of death--
In his luggage, Virginia Wolf also took his depression.
My husband totally agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was watching her between azalkas or that birds sang Greeks.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with neurotics, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.
About Pío Baroja: “What else was going on with Martín Santos, rather than targeting Joyce at Baroja?
What else was going on with Beneto before we let Baroju fix Faulkner's gun?
What else was going on to Cel, before making famous at the expense of the glory of that man,
Loss of aggression
Last week, my seven-year-old mother passed through our quarter, in the Fuenlabrad period, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by the circle and our dog, a crossroad saved from a bond shelter of at least six kilograms, without a word of his twice kicked and badly hurt him.
Our bitterness is greater than seeing nothing fun in such aggression toward a small and defenceless animal, which was also on the lead.
And to that, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these Indians, began to fear for her own safety, for this kind of obsessive, obsessed with an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at 5:00 a.m. on Tuesdays, usually quiet neighborhoods.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint against the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that this was something, and that we do not raise delicate questions, we say that these cowards were Spanish nationalities.
Distortion has made us report this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when they're having fun with the suffering of a defenseless animal that gives us love, society, and friendship.
We don't understand where the right manners, respect for animals and people have been.
Michelin and Fesvial together with the use of helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with Spain, has launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as they have been informed today.
The objective of this initiative is to stress the importance of using helmets, as it is the only means to prevent head injury and death in the event of an accident when travelling on a motorcycle.
Michelin notes that this campaign is part of their obligations relating to transport safety, which means more than designing and producing even safer products, and confirmed that they are trying to meet this purpose, even otherwise, in the form of an instruction and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase, when more than 500 fixed motorcycles will be placed in the public's awareness.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety is a constant problem - the company which is the manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, it is the first increase after 22 months of permanent collapse, according to the number of data by the party organisation of the producers of Anfac and the sellers of Ganvam.
However, the positive figure is better to put in quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and meant 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months account for 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, including all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, vans, smaller trucks and light truck/cars.
And neither the clouds, which most harmed the demand, even though they were bought by private persons, have made most of the purchases of smaller and medium-sized companies and 100% of them are financing through third parties.
Further factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of the wrong economic situation need to be added to the reduction resulting from the closure of bank credit sources.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, support for the purchase of 2000E did not help.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the persons engaged in the trade sheet of small and medium-sized enterprises who intend to buy a light utility car up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam, they again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (kimons and buses).
The sales company assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to the sales calculations for passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary system for hand brake is already mandatory.
As with the ABS anti-locking system, it will also be with the stability management of ESP, assisted hand brake systems, this will all become an mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, they already form part of the compulsory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the date for removal of the shortage is set for others, which is February 2011.
The measures put in place in the EU are designed to increase the protection of pedestrians, so that it can help avoid many precipitations.
The auxiliary manual brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency case, which the system finds out after the driver is hit.
But it can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to the study carried out by the manufacturer of the Bosch automotive parts, a third of the drivers having an accident were not carrying the brake before the crash and half of them did not use the full brake strength.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, they could avoid up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year related to pedestrians.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant-to-out calculations would prevent one of the four accidents affecting the person-after the introduction of so-called smart hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (helps the radar or the camera) captures obstacles and reported to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as intensively as possible and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, the employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American producer points out that more time will be needed to meet the Opel recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan first agreed with the party involved.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which production plants are located, will be issued at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken on these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US producer to take a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to get Volvo, but he considers the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper who operates under the ostrich of the Russian Converg Group.
In the event of no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close by the end of the year is still valid if its sale is not made.
Drive with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model of engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, therefore, the weight shows only 2.175 kg.
On the basis of the first row, the automatic download roof is in a flat version with manual control, resulting in a weight reduction of 21 kg; an aluminium door such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a decrease in weight of another 7 kg; after the assembly of the sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to a set of 19palc five kilos.
Finally, the removal of CDR-30 means another six kilograms less and the replacement of the door captures by textile captures means another kilogram.
The same is offered with a two-story PDK transmission, one vehicle with hand-held six-speed cabinets, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many complete turns.
His behavior can only be qualified as intact.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle does not print to asphalt.
Rather, we have not long tested such a small and light model, which would also transfer such safety in the turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small atmosphere capable of heating the muscles at short driving for the necessary time until we get him a sprint, braking, and restoring the use of the engine...
Thanks to the driving that's as communicative as it is, whatever we suggest to our hands on the wheel, it's what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound according to will
Sound V6 boxer, about 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very underwater and can be strengthened by 'sport' and by means of a system that modifys the engine sound that has already been used with Panama.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, whether in sucking or recuperating.
The suspensions are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads that we're going through with Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed well to slow down.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; while in some turns we encountered the light on the ground and the brush even in the advanced morning.
This ultralight car is clearly one of the most fun in the market, as it is about something more than simply the modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at the price of EUR70.831.
'Bag Girl'
The friend Karl Lagerfeld, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series, and the occasional 'starlette' at the shows 'firmy', the singer shows his face to the evil girl as boldly as his handbags Chanel.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia has awarded a victory in Israel
The work was a brilliant victory in 82-91 during its hosting on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice satellite, and this is how it got to the head of its group after the great performance of the Mirá Teletovice, which with eight triple points was declared the best in cooperative (29 reviews).
Vitoria's team could replace the significant absence of Hermann, Oleson, Huertas, or Mic's large-dose commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points was much involved in the final triumph.
The match started with a front for the blues who were on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from far away, indicating that they attacked the Israeli cooperatives very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alaskan cooperative decided for the inner game Barac and the work of Eliyah, which was accepted by sanding and delay when returning to its original site to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to be the best in his team with 13 points, although with six points in the Splitter rating it has already indicated that it will not be the best evening for Brazil.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the smallest and the Makabeans wanted to remind Vitoria that they did not win every one on their playground, and 'the hand of Elíase' could win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the return of the yellows (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, the injury, but not the dead at all, needed several exact games to take their breath, and then there appeared a cult of Mirza Teletovic, which was almost tripled and with the help of English and Ribase returned score to a relaxing number (54-67), which reached locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaskans sat on their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to prepare them for the merits of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pni and Eidson, the best in their manhood, did not surrender, and tried to keep their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite that and with Splitter voted out of the Faul seIvanovice did not bother and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already been won by the winner of Teel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injury makes Unicaja fight
Unicaja significantly lost in Greece with Olympiacos and left him to lead Group B in Eurolize in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by internal game(Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which made Greek victory easier.
The Malaga team has not been relieved of the environment of the Pavilion of peace and friendship or rivalry, perhaps one of Europe's sicker ones, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three points each other, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, lit the playground with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympias was surprised by the intensity ofUnicaja , although in the arena of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Uncle and Schortsanitis, he turned score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between resistance to the USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to work and demonstrated its advantage in both zones where the absence of English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors by Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team.
Among the internal players and Lithuanian wings of Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minutes 19.
An impossible rematch
The third part was very assaulted by Olympiacos, which, although losing by 19, demonstrated the advantage and even managed to match the difference in the match in Malaze Málaga 66-48, a minute 27, which was shaking by the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was hurt during the last match.
Despite all my failure to pay Unicaja thanks to the leading and triple points of Cook and the benefit of Lewis left a certain hope n of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to strengthening and overflowing in centimetres in his zone, showed that they were unstoppable.
Croatia's beer Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance the bassket average 81-62, minutes 37, and Unicaja called and handed over the lead of Olympiacos.

Brazil set Zelay's departure date
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelay's accession to Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'Affaires Brazilian embassy in the Dutch capital, confirmed for TV Globo that “Mel” knows that he has to leave the embassy at this date, where he has been hiding since September 21st.
“He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge.”
The station also quoted the former state, which confirmed its intention to leave the embassy before the time limit set: ‘I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the abuse of the Brazilian government,” Zelay declared.
Following the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo) Zelaya had been elected, he assured that it would continue at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
Finally, the operation fell down because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that the government tried to impose on him, which is chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when inflation assets represented a changing mood in markets, there was again uncertainty in the markets, which should not surprise, because it is already a natural state in an environment where the actors take decisions about the future, which is uncertain.
The treatment used by central market stabilisation banks was a direct purchase of assets and indirect liquidity release in a nearby exchange rate so that financial institutions could buy off assets for deduction.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct acquisitions of assets have ended practically, and without questioning their non-natural liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw a little sand into the circle, as the Spanish Central Bank has done with its auction last year.
The investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in a return to a reduction in risk yields.
The movement of the storm and the differences in bonds of society has regained the points, although they are still very distant of the abnormal level they have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, it pushes to the quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become a refuge of selected investors, extending the differentials of the euro area countries to Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risks, which have once again tried to burden the conscience of the persons responsible for the global economic policy in order to prevent the destructive consequences of reducing the loan to employment, if a new day of thanks would actually have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore power in emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen that before.
The government that hides deficits, elections, and the new government is coming in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from the failure to meet foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member States not to fulfil their obligations.
However, what is logic is that Ecofin forces the Greek Government to make transparency and commitment to its own citizens to shared responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are located before the period of normalisation of the transitional risk premium, after some exhibits on supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences fall and ours continue to expand, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdota. When our leading indicators force most of the services of studies to assume their recovery scenarios and review their scenario of growth for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not know the great hope of achieving this warning.
Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being, it seems to be a good opportunity for a friend of the driver's.

President Iberdola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene before the subcommittee of the Chamber, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention followed by the speech by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán provided a few comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommittee behind the closed doors.
According to President Iberdola Spain needs investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another 60.000 million from this date to 2030, if nuclear power plants are currently in operation.
If this does not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million but 95.000 million.
In fact, Iberdola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the question has been changed and more performance will have to be increased.
Its offer is focused on gas plants and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and especially on renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that the new 18.000 MW needs to be new, but with other sub-operable energy,
Galán, who believes that the proposal of the Sustainable Economy Act, which the government has just approved, is consistent with the line that the company has requested, did not want to let live as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, there is a clear long-term stake in this sense, in spite of the precise measures, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever it is, Galán considers that investment decisions, although long-term, have to be adopted now, because their recovery is ongoing and a stable tax framework is necessary for their launch.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The daughter Ferrovial for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferential partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belong to the most important of them.
The agreement that has not yet reached economic deadlines has been valid for five years.
On the other hand Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and Universita in Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a cooperation protocol for the creation of a Smart Infrastructure Centre
The association foresees investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% fall to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be researching energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciony strives for his first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Accion is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, which is the market that already works as an energy and water business.
The construction that is about is a tunnel estimated at $1700 million of Australian dollars (about EUR 1.047 million).
Her opponents are French business Bouygues and German Hochtief.
Tunel long 5 kilometres in the Australian city of Brisbean on the eastern coast became the nearest option for the Accciona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway undertaking.
The town hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initial in English) for further development of the project in the trading plan under the Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of construction and toll operation.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach $1,700 million of Australian dollars(EUR 1.047 million) and in the final phase three concession contests with significant presence in European buildings.
A group called Transcity leads Accion, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, and the second based in Italy is one of the largest European specialists on underground construction.
Against the Accion group is in the North Direct company with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last company, which has passed through it, has the name LBRJV and is involved in it the Australian capital Leighton (the company of Hochtief, represented by ACS), also by the local Baulderstone (the German group of Bilfinger Berger), and a significant company specialised in the civilian construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but with it there is a clear difficulty in entering other than by means of the acquisition of local construction companies.
The strategy followed by the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to Asian references.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted company Leighton.
Monetary assets
Accion is based on a geographical area with the greatest importance for a given sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as energy supplier and in the settlement shop.
Among other assets, the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) is in Victoria and leads the group of undertakings that build and manage the decommissioning facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground path to which the promoter is the Library for Infrastructure of the city, called Northern Link, is to connect the western highway from Toowong with the district route in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce the traffic overload of the Brisbane.
The calendar established by the local administration plans to award for summer 2010 and start the work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in recent months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned until 2016.
Tunel started to design in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queenslad government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brigbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia still brings Hochtief a significant profit, since yesterday it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
Share ACS running through its local Leighton infrastructure unit of the national wide-band network with cable from optical fibers.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet of 400,000 people and provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project of the King George tower on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brestane. Construction work was only supposed to start and Hochtief closed the sale for129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine cup, the FCC has obtained an allocation of EUR 64,5 million of a tunnel of 2.1 km for the Slovenian motorway.
The company won a contract a few days after the work was done to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Rakakia) for 130 million.
Alpine thus strengthens his experience in the construction of tunnels.
Starting work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Rushmore got a commercial in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services in the last two years to Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of EUR 3 million per year, informed the railway company.
The contract contains the possibility of extending by 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected between 16 agencies that have presented in a competition released by Renfe, four of which have been completed in the final four, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for creating advertising in the last three years.
From this moment on, Sra, Rushmore will look after the design and production of campaign.
The total amount of EUR 63 million for France Télécom for the braking of competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on LFrance Télécom for anticompetitive behaviour in Caribbean areas that belongs to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes to consumers at the edge of regulation.
This penalty of former French monopoly, and still the state company bought more than EUR 560 million fines since 1994, by imposing obstacles to its competitors.
The damage imposed yesterday was raised by de facto because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar breach like in the past and that there has therefore been a recession.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and opened a trade with applications on the Internet with a view to increasing revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange business will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries as Spain.
Play the Champions League has brought from the beginning of 476.4 million Madrid and Barça
The master league has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
Manchester United lead the Listina.
Manchester United lead the Listina.
Winning the UFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
Until that point, the competition divided EUR 5.362.5 million between 105 teams (from 12 Spanish ones) which participated in this event since the launch of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this separation very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he won for participation, and the only one together with AC Milan, who won three major prizes.
The Catalan present champion and the last winner of the stagnant Pohora Europe in 1992 is in classification fifth.
The list is held by Manchester United and the Munich Bayern, two teams, which in addition accounted for the most money for participation in the previous Lize masters.
And yet she lost both of them to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is up to the third country that has gained the most money through the Champions, even though it has won the most of all (to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by a complex procedure for the distribution of money used by the UFA.
For this accounting year, the institution chaired by Michel Platini intends to make $1.90 million for Champions League.
Out of these money, UFA pays 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre-class rating wheel (some other Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have reached their participation received only 3.8 million for their presence, in addition to the additional EUR 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for the draw (400,000 for each team). Osmifinists get three million each; eight quadruples3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets four million.
Champagne makes 9 million, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This is how the club will make at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31,2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European superpower in August.
In addition, there are moving payments to which 337.8 million are targeted.
This money is divided into the ratios of each television market.
Spanish is one of the mains and has four assigned places.
The champion of last year gets 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday details of the purchase offer of shares with which it wants to get the top place between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not undertake to make a public offer for acquisitions of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 for shares to be paid in ten years and for which interest would be paid for this deduction of1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos concluded trading at EUR 1,85; therefore Nueva Rumasa’s market value of 18% was valued by the company.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Region shall provide a period of 15 days for the shareholders to notify their interest in the sale of the shares.
The CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateo confirmed that it had joined the regulatory office.
If the purchase is carried out, the price would be 611.7 million, while Sos capitalization is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, the Sos continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to remain at the edge of possible offers for purchase and settlement of the judicial statements of his former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazars, the election of María Luisy Jorda was announced as Head of Internal Audit.
This decision makes it the first woman who has established a high function in the food business.
It's a newly created place that will belong directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the fields, as the company is still mortified in the legal battle of the alleged movement of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers's Society.
De facto cannot be won by the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new movements of funds
With regard to the Salazar credit, the former members of the Board of Firstefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Nuriega (the representatives of CCM and Unicaja) spoke yesterday to the National Court and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV allows the option of exclusion of the Paterins, which was attended by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion of which Inversora Mer participated against the Federal Paternin9 October.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it allows this operation because it understands that its conditions correspond to the standards in force and considers that it is a ‘other’ content explaining the brochure submitted after the adjustments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer was aimed at obtaining the shares of the Federation of Paterina at EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, consisting of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading in exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
Furthermore, it explained that 5.592.778 million shares which will not be able to be transferred in any way until the offer has been concluded, which specified that the price has been fixed by the Federation of Paternin under the provisions of the applicable standards.
New car valuation instruments
In these days, storms and accidents make not only autoservises.
Each day is thousands of cars who have suffered a insurance event, which have been dragged to service, where the expert must estimate damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of works and the time of labor can be long and difficult work.
Calculate by hand the cost of corrections between EUR 20.000 and EUR 30,000, including parts and labor forces, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
The providers of services and solutions for the assessment of insurance events and maintenance are concerned with the collection of information provided by manufacturers to produce and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatex, from the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation and development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the producers is not at all simple.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Sales Director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each of them provides information in another format.
In addition, the quantity of data for processing continues to increase since more versions, variants and engine solutions have been identified in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these undertakings will start working.
This is a very hot job, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle need to be catalogued and determined by its price.
In addition, each model is carried out - intelligent - graphic processing - where it is possible to push - individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to the mineral car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
Regarding the mobile park, 99% are in circulation.
Audatex has eight centres divided into the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normal mechanics experts) work together with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million per year in developing these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this huge flow of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but, according to individual countries, there are also spare parts tools or for calculating car sales or residual values.
The only company with a guide available to inform about the value of vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States he does.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the Star Product AudaPlus, the standard solution to the award of insurance events designed for the expert.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs of parts, the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the bottler shall also include.
This tool shall apply according to application for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5,75 euros for customers who use it less than ten times a month.
Then each insurance company carrying out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the assembly line only on the basis of the first heading of the chassis.
AudaGlass is concentrated on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows vehicles to be disabled with overall safety events.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying tendencies, carrying out geodemographic analyses or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modeling brands have passed through the service due to the crash or how much serious insurance event has suffered over a certain period.
Gt Motve is the only Spanish undertaking that deals with the development of this type of tool.
Among other things, Gt Estimat is sold, which is also intended for the expert and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motve is a company of Einsa group based in 1971 as a supplier of services and a solution to the assessment of damage, accident or maintenance of cars
Gt Gía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in service, 32.00 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% per year in the last three years and in 2008 they charged EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the internationalisation of the installation of offices in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 she studied in Spain.
According to the company's resources, 62% of her brother is formed in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, including 3,000 in Spain.
The world invoice of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19,1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera’s group stood at $1.000 million and now its shares are estimated at USD 2.400 million.
Since 2007, it has been anchored to a storm in New York and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of damaged vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an Internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after insurance events.
The operation assumed an increase of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could extend by 15% remaining next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase and sales is supplied exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, service, sale of spare parts and professional dealers who must register before the start of the operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads every day on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish car law, the number of the chassis has been removed cannot return to operation but can be used as a source of spare parts which have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be permitted to operate, although they were removed after a preliminary procedure.
Budget of service in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user will receive the budget in four steps: vehicle identification, spare part search, budget and budget generation.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of professionals of a higher age who are more or less sustainable when using new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, of which tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with Internet connection.
After identifying the model to be fixed, using the chassis number, a recalculated graphic display of the model appears and then the required spare part will be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of labour, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument for valuation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is oriented to service and does not include an estimate of labour force.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year which the customer can finance.
At the moment, Audatex is working to make this display three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanics welcome, for example, allows you to choose the door and turn it around to display the inner side.
