The Republican Party’s strategy against Obama’s re-election
The Republican leaders have justified their policy of necessity against electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre calls such fraud as a myth with the fact that the election fraud is less frequent in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
The Republican lawyers have, in the last ten years, reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US is responsible for the federal elections of individual states.
And in this spirit, most American governments have been declaring new laws that make the election or registration into the electoral list more difficult since 2009.
This phenomenon was recorded following elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives came in 26 states.
As a result, 180 proposals of the law restricting election law were submitted in 41 states only for 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to submit a photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the time limits for elections in advance, make the right to sign up to the list of voters on the day of the elections and withdraw the right of citizens to register in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 elections, he did not require any US state to submit an identity statement on the election.
The first country to make this request was Indiana.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to expand this process to other states.
In the last two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to submit photo identification cards.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, it does not have 11% of the American citizens, i.e. 21 million people at the age of allowing to vote, no photo identification issued by the government of their state.
In addition, it does not have an ID of about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the acquisition of a required identity card is often worth more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, minority members and low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with income under $35 000; 18% of citizens 65 years of age and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years of age therefore do not have a required photo identification.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters with their inclination to democratic candidates are not entitled to use their photo identification issued by their school in several countries.
On the other hand, the same countries allow fishing or fishing clubs who choose, rather, the Republican candidates, to use the cards issued by those clubs during the elections.
By 2004, no State required the election document on citizenship.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, some twelve states have adopted laws which lay down the duty of voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures obviously aim at reducing the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is necessary to note that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic side.
Republican legislation in 2011 supported in eight countries laws that disrupt the voter's registration on the day of the elections.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, the campaign helped to register around 10 million inhabitants.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 have resulted in a decrease in the entry of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the elections period in five other countries.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, African-Americans accounted for 33% of voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in this country were only 13%.
It was the same in Hispanics.
They created only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the white people who represented 76% of all voters were only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters were very strongly opposed to the approval of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Democratic governors blocked some of their laws.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the United States Attorney General has even hit.
The damage was partly reduced.
For example, only 16 of 34 states were adopted by laws requiring photo identification.
However, the new rules put forward are of no doubt making the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
The democratic criticisms speak primarily of the predominance of the laws approved and consider them a clear effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Centre Report shows that the countries where these laws were approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the election congregation necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on election participation.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: do you have an examination or not?
The PSA test brought the wrong results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to unnecessary medical trials.
All this has increased the weightfulness of men who have already been so hard on the examinations at all.
Let me investigate or not?
We asked two experts for an opinion.
In the U.S. studies, there was a high level of contamination among individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, was a difference in mortality among patients who were under examination, and those who did not go to them.
This study also demonstrated a 12-year interval that those who fail to study have a higher risk of metastasis of 30% to 40%.
I therefore recommend examinations from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age if your direct relatives have had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more threatened by the group.
The key is to take the right decision as soon as cancer is exposed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are non-active.
It is therefore necessary to explain correctly to the patient the degree of risk of his cancer, to offer him alternatives, not to necessarily treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not heal because their cancer type is not aggressive and does not threaten them for life.
We suggest that they perform active supervision and, in the event of progression, we will offer them treatment.
More often and with greater accuracy, we set criteria that help in deciding which kind of treatment and which not.
However, I recommend that you conduct an examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether or not an examination is appropriate.
In cooperation with the International Neurology Society, the Movember Movement has created a tool that allows you to assess for and counter to the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, it appears to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease to adopt the principles of healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone eats healthy food and moves well enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” undermines André Beaulieu, the Canadian Society of Cancer Research.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes hereditaryity.
A percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, it remains a priority to combat smoking, although the number of chickens decreases.
Cigarets are worth 85% of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
\"But today there are 1.5 million chickens in Quebec,\" says André Beaulieu.
Explosive data: 10 years after smoking has stopped, the risk of cancer deaths is reduced by half.
Weight
The efficacy and obesity of SCC are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, the colon and the convex, the esophagus, the mucosa and the wombs.
“The research shows that regular physical activity protects from colon cancer throughout life,” reports.
Foodstuffs
It also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid the seeds for which the same applies.
Conservation of meat by handling, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development,” reports.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamins and cancer.
However, research has not yet made clear conclusions.
The studies focused on vitamin E according to SCC are contradictory.
Although one of them believes that there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks more of its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu insists on how important it is to talk about his concerns and family presidents with their doctor.
To do the exam doesn't mean you're gonna have cancer.
Higgs boson examined
A notice of the likely discovery of Higgs Boson caused a valid break in the summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all material in the universe.
And it is also the last part, whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or, at least, bad - an explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - which has not yet been observed.
However, there is still no absolute certainty between physics that it is Higgs' boson.
It is not doubtful that we have a completely new particle available, which is very similar to Higgs' boson, as foretold by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto are rather confirmed, but there are still no data in order to have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it's Higgs' boson because the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what it's all about.
In this world, there is a completely indisputable law whereby two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be avoided - and don't try too hard on it, or else you'll hurt yourself.
Although the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that even with it there is a similar law: Pauli’s exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same ‘kvant state’ - this - the building, in particular, creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or fermons who obey Pauli's principle.
And in the second end, there are bosons, submissive anarchists who don't appreciate anything -- certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (the city of absolutely amazing), which is the Particle Adventure in the labs of Berkey: the mesones that we leave here without notice, and the ‘power particles of which the great natural forces are spread and with which Higgs' boson is probably related somehow.
However, it is necessary to say that these bosons are not as exotic as they could be thought.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual battery: photon, or a part of the light, which is a ‘nailer’ - electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge speeds up or changes its direction, the electromagnetic field in this particular place, as well as a cloud put into a pond.
Of this ‘extinguishment’, an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore one of the bosons,’s forces.
Stable field
Also, it's with Higgs boson, only with the difference that “distortion” needs another field, Higgs' field to show up this boson.
This Higgs field is much more stable than an electromagnetic field; it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as with frozen fisherman levels, it will only open up a large balance.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerater as a CERN speeder - a large drone acceleration with a spray volume is a circle with a radius of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogies with the electromagnetic field are again suited to clarifying the relationship between Higgs and mass.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, for example, do magnets, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold a piece of paper on their own.
And the same is true that the Higgs field does not react to all the particles: those who do so have a certain matter, while others (such as photons, look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all these researches are for,
From the point of view of science, it is a certificate of validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physics to undergo examination of any non-compliance between the observations and forecasts of SM.
In addition, few physicists literally wish to find them, because the slightest difference could open the space - new physics - and appreciate some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to say that the model has huge shortcomings so far, it does not provide any clarification of gravity (the weight!) or dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of space matter (se weight!).
However, the CERN device has not yet appeared such a solution.
Responses
The answers of these research in the everyday life of Mr and Mrs. Nováková can only be expected very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe there will be none.
See, at the beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell's labs had no idea of the revolution that their work would be causing.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Phyzik Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which created the first permanent laser beam (first rays were pulsive) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially considered to be such a “feel in the lab”
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may also result from all instruments that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan it at first, now serves as a “coc” all digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but that means that you really never know...
palliative care - the best way to get out of life...
Recently, through his Commission on decent dying with Quebek, he put in delicate questions regarding the end of his life.
The debate should be continued shortly and at the same time the bill is being proposed.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look more specifically at this question.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him provided him with a two-year delay.
“They gave me five years of life and it was seven years ago,” says the house for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where the previous day arrived.
\"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this,\" he adds.
The disease did its work: the immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or to eat alone.
Rezygnovately looking at a delicious breakfast and agreeing to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talk to the unsubs who stop by, bring him medication, offer a bath.
Courage to ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is to get rid of the passage, it humiliates me,” he believes.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors for his drug problem.
“In all my life, you learn that men can stand up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Getting back in the child phase is unacceptable to some people.
“It depends on the ability of the person to accept the return,” says the psychologist.
In view of the many people concerned with palliative care, fundamental moments are being played in the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from all cancer.
Their forecast is at least three months of life.
In this stage, a team of doctors and sisters who care for them does not provide so-called medical care.
In the case of Mrs A, 89 years old, it is the worst fear to die - to suffocate with full consciousness -
But the disease has enabled me to discover my children.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I have no wish in my life,” she says, and then she calls us to put on a breathing device.
Yet, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the next days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, care for the body with the help of nutrition is provided in cooperation with a group of volunteers.
That's what palliative care looks like if there's nothing else you can do.
To make death more comfortable.
One bed of palliative care appears in Quebec to be 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he can be provided with a brandy bag or a Pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics don't have to watch their sugar level anymore.
And death here is part of everyday life.
They didn't eat Mr. X's beer last night, which later died.
He'll finish his son's beer this morning to honor his late father.
“We help patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In Victor-Gadbois' home, days go by one, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a 36 - year - old man who rejoices from his last meeting with his family, well - based on pillows, while drinking on his honor, a tragically six - year - old man is dying surrounded by his parents, a woman and two young children after he tried all his options to survive.
“For six months there are always three to five beds for people with cancer up to 45 years,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois are coming from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care intended to ease suffering once the sick reach the final stage of their life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care house.
A few organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for home palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specializes in more specific care provided to oncological patients.
And this fundamental lack of medical care in Quebec leads to a number of physicians specialising in palliative care fearing the adoption of the Eutanasia Act and assisted suicide.
Since October, Manifest has been signed by the dogs in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they disagree against such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, thequebe health system is not sufficiently efficient to ensure that all persons have access to quality palliative care before they can agree with euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency in enormous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to ease her.
They fear that patients do not ask for death because they do not receive proper care.
At the same time, many oncologist care about his patients until the last few moments regardless of the adverse forecast.
The hope of Hélène Richard's survival was quite minimal when she left a demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncolleges that I was done with treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she would tell us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die are grateful to their nursing doctors for not fulfilling their wish when their palliative group reduced their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Directors for palliative care in the Society for Home palliative care of the Grand Montréal area, patients are prevented from treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that will succeed the patient until the moment of the scan, whether or not administered permanently.
It can't be felt that we don't see this part of suffering.
The patient we don't get rid of the pain will have a greater chance of accessing palliative sedations.
Hospitals not provided with sedatum always say the same thing: “I want to die.
However, this does not necessarily mean that you should provide me with euthanasia, rather than ‘they want you to rid me of the pain’
The implementation of this report has enabled journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in Health.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, entrepreneurs in construction and public works, lobbyists of political parties and experts in the Italian mob continue to tell what they know about the amazing-system - in which construction, civil servants, politicians, experts and mafia are mixed.
This-obor - came thequebeck tax taxpayers very expensive in particular between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has been crushed since we took major measures,” says Ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quabean Member and former Chief of Police in Montreal.
This led to a scandal in 2011 on the basis of a thorough investigation aimed at the dissolving of funds in connection with the agreement on the construction of the roads in Quebec, which was approved by the liberal prime minister Jean Charest after long delays.
‘Duchesneau’s report, confirmed the direct link between industry, non- transparent financing of the parties and the corruption of civil servants.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010,” he says,“the Department of Transport saved only a billion dollars on contract contracts,“ when some people kept their instincts to gain a share in them!
Charbonneau’s committee, which led two mayors to the demission, adds with the hope that it will be able to cover the integrity of some people.
Standing unit for the fight against corruption established in 2011
A stable unit for the fight against corruption based in 2011 is also involved in combating its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To that end, policemen, Marteau’s types, who since 2009 have ensured that the montreal’cartel of the money supply, has significantly reduced the inflatation of contracts...
Over the past few weeks, they've conducted a series of insights and accused of fraud and corruption of a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one community from the suburbs.
The next one on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his function as mayor of Laval, the third largestquebeck city.
He's a suspect that he's repeatedly accepted his fees in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
Since the Commission explained the mechanism - the system - the acquisition of public procurement, Lino Zambia has made a distinction.
He himself devoted to 3% of the value of the contracts he gained in Montréal during these years, to the mediator associated with the mob who then transferred the money to Union Montréal, for which Mayor Géral Tremblay was running.
Zambito was generous to all sides after 2000 and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to the province parties, especially the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also admitted that he organized illegal financing for former liberal Vice-President Nathalia Normandeau.
Contracts with money instruments whose prices were spent
In Montreal, the system worked very clear.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described him in very detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and cash games worth a total of $736 000 in exchange for contracts with money vouchers at which he was overestimating the price.
The other public factors in the traffic sector admitted that they had paid the remuneration for 30% to 40% overestimate invoices through false multi-working.
The mayor's side organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of welcoming his eyes over the simultaneous budget that brought dirty money into his register.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, thus decommissioning Montréal into an extensive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal Members who issued a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Plairies area in the east of the island, since 2010 it has been directed against the sale of a local property purchased for $5 million and sold to... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a rising real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation that will finally be launched says that ‘the thread in an attempt to understand the functioning of the freezing ant to stop the gangrene and caught the vineyards’ -
According to her, the process is painful, but positive.
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to establish our own investigation unit in Montréal and ensure that these doubtful practices cannot come back.
Like when they clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public officials have cut hundreds of millions of dollars off”, but he is particularly concerned about the roles of Members who have been informed of this lsti - if they have not been wett in these readers!
It is estimated that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money and adds irony: ‘I have heard that it is just a weak reflection of reality’
The Quebeck government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100, but according to it, it does not solve the situation: ‘As far as the electoral expenditure is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics’
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public procurement and financing of the parties: ‘We can no longer fall; if we are bravely focused on the nature of the matter, we can build again on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance with the laws -
If this story has exhausted the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, the Duchesneau recommends all those who mock him to look at their own yard...
-PSG is not FC Barcelona -
In this season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals going into each other or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day I get along with them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in the fights.
Everything goes so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
Already from my beginnings in the preparation at INF Clairefontaine to the stepover to Saint-Etienne I've always been moving about the individual degrees.
So you're using a competitive environment that was introduced by Carlo Anceletti...
Forces from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it shows that a player like me then has a bigger taste for playing and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
My hands are assistants like Claude Makele, who played the same post as me.
And does Anceletti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti respects all the techniques.
Today, he does not have a level playing field in his first league and belongs to the best European trainers.
He has great experience and has gained a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I graduated with him in January with a relaxing conversation.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
Lyon took our lead position in the first league.
We're staying in the curtain.
One of our main objectives is the League of Masters: we have made it very easy to move to the eighth grade.
What's your club's target in this competition?
We'll try to move as far away as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a heavy opponent for quality European teams.
First we want to win our qualifying group in front of Port so that we can play in the 8th edition of home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget's got...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and sign into history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, PSG has the means to carry out this intention.
And would there be great failure not to win in the 1st league like last year's season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've been missing enough last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it's gonna work out this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also working on the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media are expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what we've invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troy 4:0 at home, and there's still something that's been read in the paper, it's not really nice.
Man asks what more people might want from you.
Of course, it's not worth 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In Lize masters, we've proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought for the second season in the eighth grade, and they also invested large amounts!
Because of the sums invested, you could expect to have a lead before the other 15 points!
You insult other clubs and French leagues.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not go too well last season, have moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope we can smile in May and say that despite all the difficulties we managed to win.
It seems as if the PSG relyed on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovich in all things.
It is good to say that there is a link to Zlatan.
That means Ibrahimovich is very powerful and gives many goals.
That's why he came here and shows he's the star of the 1st league.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect the man and the players.
Even he respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increasing their own level of the game.
Thiago Silva, who is among the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representation?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been through this, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I'm also good at playing good games.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined my representation.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you look at Didier Deschampse's first month at the head of the National Team?
He's making the results.
We're in a good place to qualify for MS.
Coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and able to catch up for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc, too.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved its goal by qualifying for Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the tie (1:1) from 16 October in Spain a solid starting game?
This fight has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before that shock in Spain, I did not experience such a struggle for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
All current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political view: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (psed), represents both virtual money (continuable yet to dollars, euro...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between couples.
Thanks to 15 000 computers involved in the network, about 200 000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand web pages already receive bitcoins as gifts or as a payment.
The bitcoin first reached the maximum of 30 euros (23 euro) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is moving to the border for about $10 (the view of the courses is given on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to world exchange for real money or financial products, it's not impressive.
Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to the most successful virtual money - the competing dollar and the euro - and the forms of ordinary money -
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being like “ccredits” used for the video game that a person acquires or can buy (and also switch back).
The Social Network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, each month the central authority controls and processes individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nodes of the depositors of the books of current accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers are all connected.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in fact between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thus providing anonymity.
The data set related to this transaction is signed electronically by a encryption system with a double key.
The network may thus verify the legality of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is still possible to ensure that exchangeable bitcoins exist in the public book of common accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase consists in writing this new transaction into this book.
It takes place by solving the mathematical task of the given computer, whose solver, some temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a phase of decomposition of the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take over this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole thing will be dilated.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (at least zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction shall then be clearly displayed on the chain of all other transactions; any modification of the print would have occurred.
If the user would like to pay twice the same money very quickly (up to ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into 100 million, so the margin area is...
The difficulty of the task is also increased with increasing calculation levels.
The network has already experienced its heights and falls.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and cut off stored bitcoins.
“The used crack does not concern the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noizat, founded by Pamium, a company for the payment of the real money that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of laundering dirty money through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, as a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of Weizman's Institute in Israel have recently analysed the book of current accounts and demonstrated that almost 80% of the Bitcoins do not rise.
In November, the ‘brew discounts’ were launched.
“It was replaced by $30,000,” Jon Holmquist rejoices, who works for Coinabul dealing with the transformation of battles to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a non-contact pay phone but uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper because of this.
Moreover, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up with dealers where no new terminals or software is needed.
Just tell the address that can be photographed and recognized by the phone - explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and move towards more horizontal systems.
“Although Bitcoin is established, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive,” he explains.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB foresees a re-evaluation of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Subibi).
NATO and US units should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army take control of its territory and that the Afghans choose their own future and wait for everything from us.
The greatest injury was suffered by people in the Afghan countryside that we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so have we, for we have lost 88 dead soldiers, and all those injuries and freezing.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often rural people who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were added to them by Jihadites, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajik.
They now experience tolerance and often help local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French units from the basis of Niirab, which I followed from the peaks of the mountains planted with mandorons thanks to French loans, took place in order.
The fronts of the truck and the armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by an airlock helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed considerably since their unstoppable procedure in 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at that time, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of the struggles between different resistance groups.
Their acceptance of control over the countries was considered to be their kind of exemption, a return to security.
The Afghans paid a price for the darkness of these peasants, who fully controlled Al-Ka'id, but their situation has not improved in our time.
Some more mujahed men, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree in an effort to maintain women in a submissive position.
The main rankers of war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became state landmen, who sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US subcontracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them were never in the fight.
According to what I heard in the campaign, people are looking for a government that will not create thieves.
Many youths want to leave as they leave those who have managed to use American generousness: the loss of capital is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and associated ideology.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, they knew the modern world and its advantages were taken into account.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; in Kabul there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five total population.
In cities, state schools are full, and there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to provide work, they will no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, like mobile phones; television and Turkish TV shows the modern world, is watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will stand in her forehead be regarded as legitimate?
Some of the commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing the province miles that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a zealous country with a strong influence of local identity, should look forward to decentralization in Western states' pattern, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so there was a cancellation of the post of the Prime Minister, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
The President of Karzaí does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been significantly dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has been able to restore, no dam is working, no major flooding system is fixed.
They bring everything; nothing is produced, just fruit and vegetables.
Prediction has a private initiative.
In the country destroyed by three decades of wars, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
The rumors have been made that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And that just gave the feeling that the western states were here just to get it fixed.
Without energy for processing iron ore or copper on site and without the means of transporting raw materials through the mountains but no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the mine on the copper Mes Aynak and have left international archaeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore a vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the whole province.
One day it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large proportion of imports and exports depend, restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common aid: girls and boys' skis, French Cathedral at universities, French institute, military cooperation, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative to take on heart and soul - trying to bring together the task of bringing together assistance and military activity, in which it worked as a service for civil and military steps - the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was cancelled in 2012, but achieved thanks to the countless French NGOs’ non-governmental organization of success in the field of common interest and steps to restore agriculture in the tens of mountain villages.
These work, involving a number of local workers, helped to dampen the surface: flooding, wells, drinking water, rainforesting, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the working area.
What memory do we leave after two billion euros of military spending?
Much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude of more than 2 000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from the local communities in the Kapza province.
In order for these farmers to free themselves from the rebellion conducted by foreign groups, they wish to achieve insignificant civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and affect them directly.
Heavy work at the Egyptian Institute
President Muhammad Mursi joined the next poker party.
While Egypt remains most divided in his history because of the publication of a constitution which temporarily grants him unlimited powers, he decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text.
A few weeks ago, she gave the head of the State to this Assembly two more months before the completion of the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a reliable text that has been supplemented many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal disputes.
This new initiative has further strengthened the country's division.
From the point of view of the opposition, the President continues in his “autocracking delirio”, continuing to resist his word, and ‘faithing the law.’
However, his followers ensure that it is a means to combat constitutional and political crises as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short time section that forces the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to re-establish national and democratic legitimacy while all countries reject protests.
As confirmed by the American Week of Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this quick organised vote builds the Egyptian people before ultimatum: ‘You will approve my text, or I will leave unlimited powers - which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 Members of the General Assembly of the Constitutional Assembly with a large majority of Islamists have approved texts.
Most liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the publication of the Constitution, they stabbed the door with no possibility of exercising their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or religious minorities, have seen their step in imitating.
In order to be able to achieve a capacity, 11 people from a number of alternates were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim fraternity.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution have often been approved unanimously.
The commentators continued to stand on the fact that one of the few disputes that day was around... hours for prayer, when some of the Committee members held the view that the hours in the sitting room were not properly arranged.
The text that was voted for last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains consistent with the version of the 1971 Constitution and provides that the principles of Sharia law are the main source of the law;
The salafist party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped that they would replace the term ‘legislary’, which would allow more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been executed represents a sign of their good will and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
“Prystice” is what the liberals argue, who only see a rhetorical problem in this.
According to them, the Islamicisation of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they focus on Article 220, which entrusts the University of al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular for matters of control of the conformity of the laws with the law of Sharia.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, because the persons called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It may be possible to see the beginnings of theocracy -
The concerns of liberals are even more depressing the fact that the next Rector of the University should be less moderate than the existing one.
“For the time being, there has been no specific religious consequences.
Egypt remains a civil state with this constitution.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamists, but university workers, a number of them studied in French schools, - the mild concern Alexis Blouet, which prepares work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that ‘there may be a dispute regarding the interpretation of Article 220’, because the deadlines used are part of a religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to ‘fiqh’ [Islamic legal science, read.].
And in the future, a question may arise, to what extent civil judges are competent to express themselves in this regard.
Yesterday's approved text is highly criticized in addition to religious pages because of the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim fraternity insists that there has been a significant restriction against the former regime.
Other disputed place: powers conferred by the Army.
In accordance with the wishes of military leaders, Parliament will not verify the defence budget, but the National Defence Council.
In addition, military courts will not be prohibited from proceedings with civilians as required by the human rights association.
This association speaks in connection with the text that they think is directed against freedom, about their doubts.
The violence act is maintained and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
No article deals with the protection of women, stressed Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch organization.
According to her, the only positive point is the ban on torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to make a television speech last night, manifests are scheduled for this afternoon.
State heads will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, they wait for Ukrainian tourists holy places, pomppes of the world and the sea from the saturated salt solution
The promised earth combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and insecurity of nature.
AaF identified five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To bow to holy places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God’s mercy will come upon all who enter into this “faithful. ”
And Galileo - instead of Jesus ’ miracles: turning the water into the wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming down the storm and filling the nets.
Jesus also appeared here to his disciples and to his resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass through the way of pain, or Jesus ’ Crossway (Latinsky Via Dolorosa).
It begins with the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passing through the streets of Old Town and leading to the Temple of God's grave on Mount Golgota - to the place of chastisement, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian bud that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legends, the tree was grown from which they made a cross to Jesus ’ discipline.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the wall of shells, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave their writings with wishes that will then be filled out.
Run the path to the vertical
The ruins of Masada's fortress remained a secret shelter from the enemy, which Herode Velická built in 25 B.C.E. for her family.
The ruins are located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with mountain climbing can get to it by their own forces.
The others will take a rope to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at a altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which enjoys huge tourism in winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists from the foothills of a shuttle bus.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they lived reportedly at the top of the mountain of the pagan gods.
Visit unique Museums
There's around 300 museums in this country.
You can't all visit in one way.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near Knessetu (parlament).
There are ancient Kumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in the caves of Judah desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The art museum in Tel-Avivu is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition are widely represented impressionists and expressionists of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which visitors represent several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figures of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarai is worth visiting a unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalli and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenirs.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
The fifth museum - the Museum of Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
Come in - and you will find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are shaking.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also committed.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa centres of Israel are broken down on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it can be bathed in winter months, because the temperature of water in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsia and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and there are people in it for the whole year.
The dead Sea is, by the way, the most special sea in the world, located at the lowest point of the planet - at 417 m above sea level.
Azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the surface and those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealisticly beautiful.
Set here to undergo treatment using salty water - salty water, and a medicine mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, ecchyms, arthritis, inflammation of the glands, diabetes to cure your noble nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It protects the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them, there was a famous maritime path connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The memories of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it's the place where Noah built his arch and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived together for a long and happy life.
Indeed, tourists love tolls with narrow streets named after the signs of the eloquent.
They say that if you lean on the walls in the side of the street, the sign, happiness will be favorably inclined to you.
In Jaffa you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarai - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and “goodness - the fortress of the crossmen.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontské Pilate.
A carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speak in this country.
It is better to take money not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for checkels (now 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 checkel).
The city transport is mainly bus buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower town with the top.
It's essentially a underground rope track.
Traveling to all types of public transport is worth 6 checkels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition celebrates shabat on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it is stopped working on the market, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a meal basket: with the exception of pork meat, seafood, fish without ham and dishes in which a combination of milk and meat is included.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish taste lobster, various kinds of sauces, balls from milled foreign - wavefel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel's cities.
So there are very many fed cats, which are gravisously smothered according to their taste -
In the evening, you can see how she sleeps on roofs parked cars.
Pregnant cats love crowded places and taste each goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And rent a bike will cost about 15 checkels a day.
Tickets to museums cost 30 checkels on average.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know the country and rest.
The Earth visited from January to October 2012 at 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
“A great and powerful one,” says Moscow: The emigrants save their money on their tongue
While human rights MEPs and defenders are still discussing the law on compulsory language trials, in the country, frauds have already appeared to be sold to the “gifted” certificates
There are 13 million foreign workers coming to Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Ubbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, he entered into force the law whereby any working migrants will be obliged to undertake a test of Russian language knowledge.
So far this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
FMS promises, however, that the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors in time.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and fundamental rights.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where it is a Russian official language.
This law does not belong to people who successfully managed to achieve the accreditation and get academic diploma to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test places will work under the arrest of the Puškin Institute of Russian Language, the University of friendship between nations, Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petrohrad and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing also supported Members of State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law entered into force, human rights defenders have managed to ask a question many times in the press: what will it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of migration services are responsible - this will reduce the number of people who suffer from “slave work” -
Many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers today, explains the President of the Board of Directors of FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.
Only a system of organised recruitment will enable 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with migrants without a job, without education who do not know language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebele - the future migrants are sentenced to encounters with unholy people who will help him under the premier - the ban - to the horrific, tight accommodations, in which he and dozens of others like him, spend months without food and documents and to spend for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We're getting many complaints from our migrant workers.
“In their country they promise them one thing, but when they arrive, they will entertain their passports, they will not pay the promised wages,” confirms the head of the main tax administration of the labour migration of MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't give up!
The less that many citizens of the Central Republic who intend to work in Russia acknowledge that they do not only know the language of the country to which they want to get into but do not have experience even with the work they have.
Of course, this is not their fault, as rather a disaster: there are very few Turks, Umbeks, Tajiki can afford to obtain at least a reasonable basic education.
Their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed decently, dressed and washed up into school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they must be treated for work on their first chance.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.
- You feel humble and less valuable -
It is true that, given the law on language trials, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
The testing will only be done with those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take the exams, they won't get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live just like they used to be in Russia illegally.
“Welcome, or Unauthorized Entering is prohibited”
Many of the incoming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, legislation costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we basically have fake documents, no registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
“They require a hundred, two cigarettes, tea, - they shared with journalists about their experience as citizens of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
- Come on, don't be daft, buy a painting -
On the first day of the Act on Language, it was found that false documents of migrants were not only available for registration.
FMS employees have already completed several false certificates of language examinations.
The printed documents are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get free: each of the migrants in the hope that they would facilitate the problem with passing tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times higher than having an official test: that's going to cost three thousand rubles to migrant workers.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, in this respect government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Government authorities may so far promise to foreign workers who have failed to handle tests for the first time, the necessary time for them to graduate course of Russian language bases.
For visitors who do not understand Russians, work is expected in areas where active dealing with humans is not required.
MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not market illegal arms
The share of criminal offences using legally held weapons is very low
Russia's MVD is proposing a strengthening of the law in relation to civil weapons owners.
This is the reaction of governmental authorities to recent events: the cases of shooting at the weddings were taken care of without the victim, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in seven people being killed.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which they can obtain a license for arms wearing - from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea supports the head of the Committee on Safety and Combating the Corruption of Irina Jarovaja, which promised that the amendments to the arms law would be presented by State pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the road-trucking screws -
There was an open letter on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand refusal - ingenious detouring - law.
The percentage of chuliganism with registered weapons is minimal, declared Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian editor of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, 142 criminal offences were committed in the six months of 2012, using gun weapons registered by the Ministry of Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand criminal offences were committed during the same period.
Authors of an open letter are convinced that the legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not mean that the perpetrators go to the market on-the-black.
According to their words, we can currently find any weapon at a low price in Moscow.
At the moment, the Home Office claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The Black - Gun Market is stocked with several channels.
The main channels are five, says the Colonel in Victor Baranovice, who worked ten years at the Ministry of Education and General Staff at the Ministry of Education.
Screenshot pages that accept weapons orders
The first of them - a military or a military journey - that means a weapon that was cut off during the fight against the Caucasus.
“The weapons also stole Russian officers and self-evidents,” says Baranac.
Another type of black weapons is the weapons of stolen criminals with security forces.
Baranec explains that there is also theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the employees of the law enforcement authorities in criminal proceedings.
Illegal, mostly, are available for sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
“It is proven that some fires have been founded intentionally - to cover up the manka,” says the former soldier.
They bring their contribution according to Barance and weapons manufacturers.
“Now there are private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market and are handing out weapons that supply black markets including Moscow,” says this expert.
Another source - the market is smuggling.
Especially a large number of guns and slots come from poor countries such as Kyrgizstan.
“This is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and there was a mob that organized their smooth production,” explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of individual sources of illegal weapons supply to the market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Designing of Public Administration.
Specialists discussed the statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminal literature and the public data portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, reports researchers, comes from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons have been found on the black market by some official actors whose work is linked to weapons, - it is known in the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons from armed conflicts came in 14% of the cases where weapons were stolen in their production, 5% was a black archaeology.
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons stores that he asked us not to show his name is convinced that the weapons found in the black digs -archeologists - no longer bought - are just too old.
Most often, as he says, the sellers run for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
Through the banner, he buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he sells it over your fence.
“He will take her to the city and sell it for 900 euros per piece with two stores,” he tells.
“The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and, therefore, whenever they start to burn down a plan in terms of criminal clarity, they will carry out a control purchase for illegal arms dealers,” says the adviser.
-As in the luxury shop -
The seller and the buyers most often find each other through their friends.
I visited web pages and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to go to a platform - Experienced - where a man who would lead me to a “baby” - where we will act together.
I've learned most of the prize up there
Military rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, he's telling the seller-- the counselor I have, but I don't fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there also needs to be gone, hypothetically, from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that the daughter had fallen out of his tooth.
And now I'm going to get through a man I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me, too, because he knows I won't.
Starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranovice tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he worked to publish on this subject.
According to his words, she hasn't changed.
They gave him an album with photographs of where it was, all of them, what you had thought.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,“ a soldier remembers.
The buyer, according to Baranovice, does not offer a rabbit in the bag - you can try everything.
Me, potential client, I'm not just buying - we're going with the seller in the woods and we're building a target.
“They give me the chance to shoot, and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we act,” describes the progress of the expert.
Tray on the couch
Search engines will bring you to the website and groups on the website of the website and the Vkontakt - where it is offered to buy weapons - for various purposes -
No documents or personal meetings are needed for this.
“It’s worth the amount of money to have,” they write an advertising title on the website -Buy a battle gun or a vending machine -
On this site users leave their announcements and ask questions.
And selling the minor?
-Of course, without a licence, the user - Ivan - (the law is maintained).
“I will buy TT.Moskva - - briefly formulate the requirement -Fedorenkov -
The Federal Security Service recently launched a huge network of sites and people who wish to buy a military weapon can go off with a shovel.
People play like hungry fish on bait and then finish coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior officer Viktor Baranec
I've heard of such diagrams:web pages are usually registered beyond the Russian laws' borders.
People take orders.
The buyer will make payments through the ATM.
In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden,” says the press spokesperson of the non-governmental organization -The right to the gun - Dmitry Kislove.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after ordering an order on the website you can stay without weapons and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently launched a huge network of sites and people who wish to buy a military weapon can go off with a shovel.
“The people are proud as hungry fish on bait and then added coal to Siberia,” confirms.
100 bucks macarov
When buying illegal firearms, you will normally pay the amount from 100 to 900 dollars, according to expert estimates.
According to Dmitry Kisl's words from the non-governmental organization - Right to the gun - you will order a gun from Makarov for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The gun is dispatched from warehouses to long-term storage through medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official statistical office, compared to January - October 2011, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the U.S., they're staging fastfood and supermarket workers.
Work in the cash store -McDonald - will pass through to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and in the restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as McDonald-Burger King-Taco Bell-Wendy's - a-Kentucky Fried Chicken -
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine, or whether it is soon to be avoided.
The entire event is supported by unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest payments received by serial workers in Walmart and in rapid refreshment systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically underrated by the professional movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “black Friday”, when the orgy of cheap sales struck America, it captured millions of inhabitants, and in some cases it was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart employees, in which all the world works on 2.2 million people, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with the unions and left-hand activists of multinational trading chains whose goods are intended for people from lower and secondary classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many low wage employees in Walmart shop only buy at work.
The availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of America's largest companies.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods so cheaply because few pay his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions such as lack of automatic trucks or hand scanners.
The demonstrators of the “black Friday” demanded a raise of wages and complained that the costs of health insurance provided by the companies increased dramatically from 30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart gets $4.5 per hour, but that doesn't match the amount of expenditure, they say employees.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley say that if Walmart increases average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost 3.2 billion a year.
It is on average by 1.1% more than this company is spending on wages now.
If Walmart moves the increase in wages fully to consumers' shoulders, each visit will only be 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than today.
The advocates of Walmart point out that the protest was only in nine countries and that society should not have caused virtually any damage.
In the company's stores, on Thursday to midnight the following day, Walmart sold around 5000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers performed on-the-day Friday, almost 100 million transactions.
Dan Fogelman said in an interview for Huffington Post's cheap-oriented website that the jobs left a total of less than five employees of Walmart, and that the protest was all-in-all media relations organized by the unions.
“Unsettled Treasury”
Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was not to trade homes Walmart (they in this progressive city are not very popular, and therefore are almost not here), but “McDonald - and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of New York City Council
At present, he is making minimum wages for work in accordance with federal laws and the New York State rules for $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wages, but only slightly, and on average they receive their serial workers in New York $8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower wages in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can be in New York for that kind of money.
The staff of McDonald will go through almost a quarter of the American teenagers who work behind the counter after school on part time and live with their parents.
Only a few people find their main source of nutrition or plan to stay on the ground.
At the moment, I constantly meet in an interview with workers - McDonald - who complain that they have to live out of this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal hangs a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you feed them.
The protest participants, which started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at the “McDonalda” at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cash registers and chefs in the fast food shops start getting at least $115 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the fresheners.
American laws prohibit management of the establishment of trade unions and the punishment of the activists of the trade movement by bullying and release.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult to introduce a rapid refreshation of the trade union on the initiative.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high fluctuation of employees.
I do not agree.
On this day, loud protests were also held in many other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
In the afternoon assembly of the event, there were several local democratic politicians near Times Square, especially a member of the Jumane Williams City Council, who said: “McDonald” says he sells billions of portions, and then he does not even pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your honest work.
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that “we have to step up together to support fastfood workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which each non-voluntary worker deserves”
As the New York Times newspaper described it, it was the biggest event of its kind in the history of the American sphere of rapid refreshment.
But only a few hundred people were involved, although not all of them were employees of fast refreshments in New York, employing tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become a spark that will burn the flame of a mass movement is yet unclear.
\"Now the brain is capable of lying on average--
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology, the popular theme of widespread reality is the popular topic; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the edge of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference Google presented a working model for this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also submitted an application for the appropriate patent.
From an interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that glasses are already in the past for scientists of this company.
The perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public protection.
Please tell us the framework what your research group is dealing with?
We are concerned with the interaction of man with the machine, but at the same time we are trying to shift the limits of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in a phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, and at most, it has touched the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensor - that's a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all it is a very interesting option to control using a gesture.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- No matter what, the Kinec system has transmitted interactions to physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system takes more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We're trying to change it, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective.
We need to get the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can add to the real world virtual objects in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it underestimated?
- Surely it cannot be considered as a whole - raises the question of privacy, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with the computer are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for example, we had a project in public places where we thought about gestures, but not the spoiled ones, just such cold, short ones.
The Gestapo would not have been filmed by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would follow the movements of bones and muscles.
It's big so far, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet watch.
Generally, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me, for example, to give you this soda can?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very complicated to recognize.
So you want to get the user adjusted to what the machine can or can't?
That's not necessary at all, but it's mutual convergence.
In the near future, I think we're going to have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can make human reactions more accurate.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, that is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution today, or depth or something else?
- Basically current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixel itself, it's like math and depth.
In the current view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - it makes the work of algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only in the X and Y axis, but also Z.
So it's also very important that the speed, the number of images per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and contemporary data flow 30 images per second are frankly little, especially for the gesture.
Stephen Betishes of our lab in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable delay of processing between 1 and 100 ms, with current serially produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction of a man with a machine.
For me at work, there would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so much touch, but I need some pictures in an extra second.
And it's not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- Three-cams are now being used in the Kinect system - one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the bounced signal.
And the third camera - that's actually the common sensor of the visible belt.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
The larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system Kinect, play with a curved camera location and see how it helps to determine the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think that with regard to the everyday use of advanced reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smaphone in the two hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be - the transferable - resembles the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection screen and further around the circle.
The glasses - this is a very personal device, which is their strength (you see complex things only), and at the same time the weakness - the extended reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine the moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to a normal mortal.
There is one problem which critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that widespread reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think it could be an 8th breakthrough to complement the homonymous perceptions.
So far it is used by one of the interesting tricks - using the second hand as a certain type of image base.
The pressure is recorded in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding the tangibleity to these images in the air - for example, the interference of several direction ultrasonic beams at the defined point where the finger is located, causing a tangible feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on the top of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects nerve endings in fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brains yet?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at a given moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to make a man physically located in a very tight space to believe that he is walking through an open, practically endless space - we also work on the concept of cross-country tracks (or not such as clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain failure becomes a target, then it's work for many years.
That's what he does on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in the beginnings.
English instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” is the continuation of the project, the Perhradian Avantgard, dedicated to citizens who are in charge of culture and art.
On the top of the list there were already significant figures of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose extracts exceed the city framework, they often find recognition in Europe without having reached an all-round vote.
A new hero -Rosbalt - is a stunning artist named Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who's all dressed up in red, whom you meet here at the Russian museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion hospice and in the verns.
The pictures of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical peers of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller - that's the perfect man for Petrohradian Avantgard's late '80s and early '90s.
In addition to being a city person, his vision on the streets brings a smile on the faces of the citizens, increases all the mood.
He recently took flašinet into his hand and became a pethrohrad flašinetary, because he has completed his entire divine life, philosophy and image into this complicated role.
- Cyril, why are you going all over the city in red and not in yellow or for example in a turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer with the look and the image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between artists, imagemakers and the public.
As a general rule, everything that's just a little different from the gray, becomes aggressive and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having an interview.
The entire history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to a discussion.
- And when did you understand that you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky where my work was exposed.
I understand what my path is.
At that time, the wave of the old unidentified artists and the new, free types of artists went through.
I became friends with the artists of the new waves, with post-gasonics who brought us to the “Pushkini 10”, and the other waves were not.
It appeals to me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the words.
- And all of this was part of your article-- it was important for me to find myself at the center of the culture of Petěrburk, where they should gather all the best forces of creativity.
In 1995 I occupied a place on Puškinska 10, and there was a music-music club, a Bohemian club, a home of Petěrburk gods.
There were many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how the Snuras brought the project -Ucho Van Gogh
Snur and his friends sang under a largely light song, dressed in a fitting tricote, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band began to play live, she became a “Leningrad“
Trachtenberg has led many hall-galive times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, thus his great career, his basic education, and training he gained from us.
Galerie -D 137 - club - Grijoredov - it is the name of Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and regular guests went.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture was something else.
In 2000, the survey was organised in the press, and the special price was ‘Ledé in our city’.
In the nomination of the Year, I was appointed, and my peak ended.
In new times according to old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic of a distinctive way.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits that are alive captured by news and perseverance.
I will have a programme exhibition - The Music Museum in clowns -
The clowns are overtime categories.
I used to be social, it's painful and terrible today.
But in clowns, everything's shaking, it's a tragedy.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by way of a totality disguise in the orderly order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focus on external mechanics, not the inner man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the lie will be removed by a disguise.
We've seen you recently in the role of a cityquasinator-- a cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be him if not me?
- And could commercial art be beautiful?
- At the moment, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Culture is falling apart.
People used to meet in the doves, the gods loved one, simple other people.
Today everything broke into microsociality, today is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to like everyone.
We need to think about who you like today.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And there will be a few thousand viewers on Stasu Mikilov!
- There's a group of fans out there involved in a sexual social sphere.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land, and 10,000 will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything will get dirty.
I've got fans, the main thing is, we're not gonna let them down and break what's wrong with them.
When I was young, I painted pictures of one collector hanging on the wall along with Falk and Larionov.
I started images that people usually end up with.
People often get mixed up today.
They say: spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's a oddinud.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money because of drawing images.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Peterbur?
- Good experts in culture.
There's a concept: a culture factor.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
At the time of the propercars it was not in all, the carers may not have understood the culture too much, but they understood that real experts had to be encouraged.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
With us in St Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in the corner, because there are great experts who need to appreciate these experts correctly and bring them to the right path.
He's doing tasteful today.
The same Erart, but it's different because they honestly say we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petierburk is?
- Peterburk - it's not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is a culture much more, there is the right land.
And at our downfall, art is very good.
We need cultural land, but today there are writers more than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are surprised who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
There's only a weak layer with us.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of the grant of St.Petěrburk
Family in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of the space corridors with the land on board are set aside for the journey, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: how to keep your family under difficult conditions or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think there's any great choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be mastered even if only hypothetically.
“It is Venus and Mars,” says the highly constructed scientific worker of the State Astronomical Institute of P.K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Celsia.
Living there is only possible in a large height or orbit of Venus... in space.
Talk about reproduction in the universe began by scientists with a flora.
Experiences on plants have been carried out in half a century ago.
Four generations of games grown on the orbital course are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
It was then carried out by taking insects into orbit - very small fruit flies of Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent to space to check how the embryo develops in a state of difficulty.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird on the exit.
But then there's problems.
“The problem is that this bird must find resistance, it must stand on its own legs and start moving,” says the Head of the BioMedician Institute (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sichev.
If they don't find resistance, birds are chaoticly falling and making cotremels.
After 10 hours, in freshly hatched birds, complete loss of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just perished in four days.
“We have allowed birds to hatch out two times, but then we refused because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the space of Vladimir Sichev.
Last -miniarcha - the animals flew on the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In bisatality, Bion, but only beings of one sex will be.
There was an experiment with rats that were now gravid to space.
They basically didn't reveal anything supernatural.
“It was only on bisotelites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be done,” says Vladimir Sichev.
A progeny was born upon landing on the ground.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the issue of reproduction.
It's a tough task.
Animals in the loss of their usual environment simply cannot implement their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, he can.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not performed.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The biggest danger threatened the Tireškovs.
The most precious thing that mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Chika left, and no one on Earth could say that he would last his flight to space.
Whether she can have a baby after a flight like this.
“No one has answered this question yet,” says Vachtang Vačnag.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, she gave birth to the first woman named Valentina Tiereškov's daughter.
Andrijan Nikolaev was also the father of the child.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-consonate of the Savic Light, who visited orbit twice and also worked in an open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born after long years and are growing health to the offspring.
“This can be dangerous even in orbital years,” reports the cosonaut-pilot, the Horgan of the Soviet Union and the Hrona of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Yet, mankind must seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CCPK hydrolaboratory is a compulsory phase of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions with zero attraction, astronauts have developed the habits needed to work in an open universe.
Water imitates the condition of effortlessness.
Although for adults, water is comfortable, but in a strange way, it is natural for young children.
The little imitators seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother's fruit water and that it is easier for them to get used for water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first redemption, only 2 weeks are passed.
“It is very little that the child forgets something,” says the instructor of the swimming of the newborn Marina Axenov.
Briefly speaking - if there is a condition for a newborn baby without a more natural condition, then for women there is more inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In a condition of difficulty, there is a very fast absorption of abdominal muscles, muscle muscles, the ability of the body to shed the fruit.
We can keep it aside if it works for muscle stimulators during delivery.
After all, it is possible for birth to occur in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism sheds the fruit.
-And what else is going on is Valeri Poljakov asking complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If Earth’s attractiveness is not affected by the organism, it cannot reform the skeleton or the muscle system correctly.
Newborn on a orbital course cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he can train.
He'll just be rid of what he needs for his development unconditionally.
“If we go to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a sick person who will be completely inadvertent to the environment here,” says the Head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Committee.
So spreading children in space today is just a theoretical issue.
One day, however, there will come a time when the earthmen will become a reality, and when they will go out in their roots on a far planet that will become the home of their offspring born in the universe.
Head of the SAO: Control of the department failed to blame politicians
In connection with public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controlrs and quality legislation, but it is in its application.
In an interview for Currently.cz says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
“The power will never be perfect, but it must be the correct application of it - that is what is missing in my opinion,” notes Kal’s current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of malpractice practice, Peter Nečas’ approach to the so-called “Svarcsystem”
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with his controls - is therefore prohibited or permitted?
‘The power must be determined somehow, and if it prohibits anything, the President and the Prime Minister cannot prevent the office from carrying out control and enforcement duties,’ notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Parliament, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German side, in which the legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What was it specifically about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that European legislation regulates how public procurement is addressed by individual national legislation and then practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the control is not yet complete, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, legislation is better with us, even more stringent and more perfect - but alone practice is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not sufficient to continue creating more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to address the application itself.
What can this project help you to find out what's coming from him for you?
Such a joint control could contribute to stopping the efforts to redistribute laws, reduce and improve limits when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economicity means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to rule out enriching and possibly criminal conduct.
But by reducing the limits of the contracts, we don't necessarily have to achieve this.
Perhaps the system will be covered by such a amount of “paper” - that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw much more simply than if the limit remains higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, as the SAO works there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, is just creating a different way, but in principle both authorities act alike.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so these accounting courts also have at the level of individual associations - in this way the system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, with us represented by state resources.
The public funds that are managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled from the level of the corporate accounting courts.
What about the legislation there, so it's easier than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is marked as a pattern, but it cannot be said that it is better in all things.
Is that even because they have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even the country we consider to be a pattern is faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, right?
With regard to the domestic legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Contract Law mean to your office, have its effects shown?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it does not appear in our control actions yet.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
We are looking at this only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool -the detection of the risks of insurmountability - over which we have driven nearly 14 thousand public contracts, and we have analysed them - there these changes will clearly manifest themselves, because the limits, conditions of certain types of selection procedure will change and so on.
Do you therefore consider this law to be more beneficial or any further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise here is that it will ‘harden’ rules, and will not be able to comply with them.
Already under previous rules, controlled persons are bound by a provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to mean that each non-compliance with the Public Contracts Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does the law therefore mean that it is worth making it stronger?
I don't think so.
The system needs to rule out those who want to attack him and exploit him, not punish those who commit formal doubt that has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will create only greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how come we get out of this?
Let's see where it's not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs by controlling the so-called “warship” system - and what does that mean?
The unit is prohibited or permitted?
The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the office from carrying out control and enforcement duties.
He may say: “We will change the law and let it be”, but he cannot say that we will do anything like nothing.
There are relatively strict rules in the Public Contract Law, as to how formalisation is to be carried out - which is right to protect the public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application of it - that's what I think is missing.
Roads are clear, mostly but sly
In several places of the Czech Republic roads are bright and also snowy.
Most of the cars are driving, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were snowy this morning, but frozen and also snowy.
Temperature has fallen between five to ten degrees below zero, but it is to be slightly warming during the day.
The snowing in the region has been established and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Giant Mountains, however, there are about 30 centimeters of snow.
The places were also lower visibility due to the fog, resulting from the data of the regional roads.
The R6 speed road and first class communication are now low-free in the region.
However, care is in place, for example, in some of the bridges where the surface can be thin and glandy.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also available.
In some sections, however, there is still a residue of frozen snow and snow.
Especially in higher positions, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubic and Króhradický kraj
On some roads in eastern Bohemia, there is a threat of trouble, in higher positions, and on the mountains there may be a skewed layer of snow on the roads, informs the Director of the road and highways on his website.
Road drivers are warning drivers before the accident, it can consist mainly in higher locations of the Pardubic Region.
It can be located in the vicinity of Lanškruna, Save above the Orlics, Police, Svaviv or the High Mýta, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svaviv.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest position on the roads in the Rychnov districts above the Kněžna and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today, it is most often clear to position without precipitation.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, blowing the weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen Region are snowy this morning, but with increased care and driving, the weather needs to be adjusted.
This is freezing, temperatures go between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After the previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communication may be diluent.
The seats must be counted even with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It's coming out of the information room of the regional roadmen.
The D5 motorway is almost unlimited, however, caution is advised by the communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first class roads have dry and frozen surface.
However, in southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, there may be dilated sections.
Communication of the second and third classes is wet and, in this case, alerts to sharp sections are paid.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent routes in the area of Šumavy.
Olomouc Region
With snow pea on the road today, drivers heading to the highest position of the Olomouc Region must count.
After a chemical spray, she remained on the Red Horan saddle and on her way to the Videl Cross.
The roads to the terrain drove down at night of snowing, on Šumpersk, according to road managers, about three centimetres at the same time.
The other parts of the country are mostly mobile without restriction.
-Sumpersk lies in the highest position of the remains of snow.
With snow cash on the Red Horrian saddle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník,” said the Czech Republic today.
In the field at night, their colleagues in Jesenick, travel to ande the highest positions, according to them, are now after chemical treatment of the bare and wet.
On Olomouc, however, roads are slid without limitations, but the drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the vehicles remained wet.
Ventrický kraj, Liberecký kraj
A few difficult driving places are reporting the roadsides in the north of Bohemia this morning.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, mountain roads from Telnice to Knínice are closed to Ústecek, it results from a police database.
Temperatures are also held in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are apparently on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeastern of the Czech Center, on the contrary there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Operating complications are not yet reported.
The frequency of the iceberg is reported by the roads especially from the surroundings of Puppies.
According to meteorologists for her, the weather conditions were perfect during the night - during the day of rain and snowing, bright and dark at night.
The main moves are reported adverse conditions also on road I/13 at the border of Ústec and Liberecký region.
The bottle from Telnice on the Knínice forced the bent branches of trees, which moved to the vehicle under the snow.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think he's supposed to be the end of the world for less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it, and we say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to leave or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him closer to the readers?
It's been a national benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held simultaneously on 20 December from 21 hours ago.
They will end at about a time when the Mayan calendar will end on Kiribati Island in Pacific, which is in the time zone at 12 hours before us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, and then we invented everything along with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to consider, together with the public, what kind of state this world will bring to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May Calendar we have also created a unique collection of objects shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called \"The end of the world has been canceled\"
She's already very popular on YouTube, she's also going to sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the complete conclusion, if we succeed, and the end of the world is not...
All the interpreters on all three concerts are singing simultaneously.
At the same time, the Hymnas are also connected in a unique direct transmission on Czech TV.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the video plays Tomáš Hanák, also singing in her Xindl X...
How did you get them to cooperate?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we are having a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We're trying to involve them closely in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the benefit from the concert against the end of the world?
We have been implementing with the Tap civil association in Jedličkov for the equipment of the non-barié educational centre of study.
For students of Jedličko's school, teachers regularly come and take care of them in activities they enjoy and care for.
Students themselves do not have the means to give themselves to the principals, so we try to allow them to do this in this way.
Within the framework of the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
There will be several music groups and interpreters at each concert.
What did you choose them from?
We tried to build up a program that would address all generations including children.
China, the Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dane Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar \"bombastic events\" or future?
In May we will first perform at the Prague Spring, so we will also definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're already in the US, I'd like to do it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group that is formed by hendikepovad people.
How do you manage these routes logically and organisedly?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric cart, her trucks must travel in the luggage compartment, of course, we are carrying a large amount of cargo and a box with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, the ČSA and British Airways have been great prepared for us that I have been wondering how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to the trips to abroad, you can compare how different they differ in barbaricity, public access to the hendicipeped and similar.
What have you met before?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia to see that everything else is in complete beginnings in the east.
Across from Prague, Moscow is very barriery, here it is still unusual for a man to move himself in the center of the city on his electric cart.
It doesn't even apply to self-confidence, as if you'd prefer the lift.
Fortunately, there is already a civil society that tries to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
On the contrary, what do we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is entirely common that people with heavy hendikep themselves move in public, can go to the toilet, to museums, anywhere...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities would actively participate in social life, in which we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for public or barbarism is one thing, but only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will actually change.
So far, these are rare cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago, what made you start it in 1998?
I came to Jedlik's office, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in taking care of something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone among other things, I've started an interest in music with my friend.
And in time, what our moderator Láď Angelovich tells us is a little out of hand.
The popularity has come only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to connect with famous singers and also actively work on the promotion of the band.
We realized that the work that we don't see was basically like it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it up with The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something else.
Showbusity is crowded with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical in its own way, all new ones are taken care of and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But the regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with hendikep are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with hendikep, it's not just a shift for them, it's for the whole company.
It has helped this success also by being a strict boss, how many people have marked you?
When we want to do good work, we have to be uncompromised in many things and require some discipline.
I mean, that's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, go to the product and spend a lot of time on concerts, the enthusiasm will quickly leave them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently he has the band The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only the only Man Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, that's impossible.
Whoever has will and taste has always the door open with us
Meeting the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, 202 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynoje in participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians

Available to concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have access for free tickets in pre-sales Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Poland was adopted at the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency last week for the 20th member of this European Space Agency, as the second country of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became the full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
However, Poland's trip to space has already begun much earlier.
For flights to space, Polish enthusiasts were dedicated before World War II; but not always meeting with understanding.
I will remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which, on December 6, 1933, represented the thoughts of his pioneering work Access to spacecraft.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cool and after the years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
He was awarded Robert Esnault-Pelterie's and André Louis Hirsch Award for entry into space science in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-known promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reversed side of the Moon was named his name.
Already in 1925, the railway station was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and we do not know the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used for the launch of the wire or for its sound.
Information about this others is only known from the daily press.
Since 1933, rocket missiles have started taking over Polish artillery.
Research provided the Cells of the Armed Forces in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckig.
From the materials kept, it is clear that research has reached the stage of practic trials.
However, the arrival of German troops was interrupted by research.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric jet rocket designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the expert press, and the following year the work of the rocket - torpedoed air and rocket technology was developed by Lélý-Krzywoblocková.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all military uses of rocket technology were dedicated to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory and Science Committee), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity it ended the start of the war.
Further work devoted to space science after the war in Polish press appears thanks to the work of Polish astronaut society (Poland Astronautic Society).
For the first time, there is a mention of the company in the November edition of 1954 magazine Problems, where there are four more extensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is designed to establish a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, the projects of artificial satellites have already started and it was clear that space research is a perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronomical Society (PTA) has been seeking entry into the International Astronomical Federation (founded 1951) and already in autumn PTA became a proper member.
And in the following year, the first President of PTA Kazim Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronomical Federation.
This function was held until its death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been involved in the development of a very successful meteorological RM rocket (Meteologic rocket), which has become the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on October 10, 1958.
The 1800-meter rocket was about 80 cm long and its mass was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage RRM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledovian desert.
The rocket was a long 1.4 metres long, and its mass was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type was to be able to do real scientific work - the RRM-34 rocket was to have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the height wind.
However, further developments were suspended in 1962.
Following the first RM rockets, Meteor-1 was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting mass was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, differing by the size of space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was an area of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 he took place in the Air Institute for the development of the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
The following version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the National COSPAR Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space research on Soviet artificial satellites in the framework of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercommunaut after Vladimír Remkov.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court canceled the Act on Public Works.
The resolution caused live discussions in the public.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free trade, no unlimited movement of private capital, together with unfounded financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in labour price, (hazard) price tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer is seeking to import cheap goods in competition by: ‘undertaking’, the price of the competitor in order to increase its market share and thereby increase its own profits.
In mass scale, this means either to translate production into a foreign country or to buy cheaply or disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are compared to other high economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility of the State in favour of it is necessarily growing.
The whole situation strengthens the absolute inability of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus replace the economic and social damage that he has committed in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so generally known that no specific statistical data need to be reported.
Independent private capital practices create a situation in each economy where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition in order to continuously reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into a country.
In other words, governments give private capital to all its own population regardless of the social downturn.
This is manifested primarily in changes in applicable laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept a price dictatorship of private capital in particular in the field of wages.
However, this is a system of economic enforcement in the case of long-term unemployment, but by limiting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been a number of years in the SRN of public food withdrawals for poor people who cannot benefit from their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In terms of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are very common cases that properly employed people receive such wages that they have to be paid to an existential minimum.
This scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the collective snow.
The contested measures of virtually all the southern EU countries certainly lead to the same state when people under the pressure of the catastrophic decline of social levels are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century or to live for hunger wages at the edge of society hoping that one day private investment capital will come to the country.
But is it necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, or Turek, Morocco, or Egyptians, or Africans still work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that a state of capital cannot participate in its own economy that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital is based on the opinion that the State must not interfere with the management intervention.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now actually manages politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's a clear answer, yes.
The evidence is practically all-powerful and in all states of the lucid lobby.
As a result, a desperate situation in corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where it is practically punishable, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is that the State Ministry for the lack of funding provides for the development of proposals for private law to companies that are lost in connection with industry.
These legislative proposals are then agreed in Bundestago.
All the power is not thus coming from the people as they preach it to the Western constitution, but from financially strong groups who prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly in the situation as described by Appianos in their work by the Roman Republic during the times of Caesar and Pompeia: ‘The state has been in full decommissioning for a long time and the authorities have engaged in violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisition of yarn and using stones or swords.
The bribes and corruption were not involved at all, so once as a result of this disparity was to stand eight months without consultations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As in the anti-dumping process, the current company is based on an insignificant preference for its own benefit regardless of its interest in the country.
Private capital is no longer able to understand and apply a celospolitan benefit from its nature.
The result is now, as at that time, an urgent decadence of elite without any effort to reform the deeper course.
Therefore, we need to look for the colossal liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At present, the outset of these systems can be regarded as a part of liberal democracy as a certain break with the expectations of the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that current elites are completely ignoring in the future possible hundreds of thousands of losses on lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already seen with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition both internationally and at European level, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solutions are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the State in the economy will strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the company in favour of the State.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
“There will be nothing out of violence, nor can Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the refraction is, let us not forget how fragile we are.
“If my sons did not want war, there would be no“ the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschela Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, there have been many reactions.
One stands behind Israel, argued his rights in self-defense and Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the geocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fit into the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodically repeated waves of killing the vineyard and who victims, after all today's inhabitants of Israel, including the land itself, were born into the current political situation and beginning of violence.
This is what I am interested in offering readers a view of the tyre, a view of who, above all, has been serving 95 years of stress (calculated by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small portion of the Middle East country.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the historical facts available, some are derived from some of them on the basis of my own understanding of who or what a group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first of all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can see some of that Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so obvious is whether they were always these personalities who were totally autonomously following their steps or whether someone behind their throne was behind them who directed their actions towards a pre-existing target.
We must admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not come into the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is one that can be regarded as the head of a chobotnice (if anyone else is standing above them, but I do not rule out) - Rothschieds.
It's not a lot to write about.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) has already purchased in the 1990s to stop the merger of their name with highly criminal acts in whose background they have stood and which have always meant for them the fixing of power, the increase in wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in central banks do not have to lead or prepare war (before attacking Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after attacking Iraq it was 5 countries, after Kaddafi's sovereignty were left only four, but, in the meantime, Russia has doubled the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to deny this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank of Rothschield's Bank of America, began to issue his own money during the Civil War and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, he was murdered 1963, Member of Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue FED for a great economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate the plan of the three world wars of the highest, 33th degree of sanctification by Albert Pik.
The first war was intended to remove large monarchic national units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially Great Britain and the third was to lead to a reduction in the world population somewhere in 0.5 - 1 billion people (the number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is sufficient and does not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ekumenism is nothing other than the presumption for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families at the head of Rothschieldy work is to create a crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that they do not repeat the crisis as the one they created in07).
So after they succeeded in murdering the habsburg successor of the R-U throne Ferdinand in Saraev, they destroyed the first world war by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first World War ended with a sudden, military and economically unfounded, German capitulation (though there was no need for war for the destruction of the Russian Republic) and then there was a fragmentation of Central European powers, Austria Uherska.
For the easier deployment of World War II, the bankers had the policy to create a lateral conflict by imposing a huge war replication in Germany, creating a prerequisite for radicalisation of the unnecessary masses, and then just needed to undercut the Germans sufficiently strong, the vineyards identifying the leader and the simple solution, and the creation of a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to lose, and also played, the function of the fifth colony, while committing a war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotschield’s establishment of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferentially in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital city (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, starting with the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler got out of the chain on which at first international bankers held him, or all that he had done was hard to estimate, each time the suffering of European Jews in concentration created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reputes of Germany, it was made for World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel was made an outbreak of the Third War.
If international bankers manage to begin it, there will be a Jewish nation, like in the latter, the victims in the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of holiday and chaos not only within the country, but also in an international scale (only as hard as people share themselves on the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the vineyard, and who is the victim in Palestinianian - Israel’s conflict, where the wrong is to bear the wrongness in the endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of all was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are solely undermining the choice of candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascisting the international bankers of Loyal, a policy that does everything to start the war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in Shanghai, is a cooperation organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to grow in global conflict and, given the control of Iran over the Hormuz Canal, which travels 20% of all the world oil (ship corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: “Only what we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order.
The new world order in their image is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of the handfuls of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at birth of a chip that makes it a totally controlled being.
“And they force all small and great, rich, and poor, free, and slaves to have on their right hand or at the forehead of something so that they cannot buy or sell, who is not marked by that beast or the number of her name.
That's what you need to understand: who's got the sense to read the number of that beast.
This number calls man, and it's number six hundred and sixty-six.
The movie Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he occupied the crowd of demonstrative Islamic students of the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the severe chauffeur of Mohammed Réz Págí, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for a few decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive exit - to throw the sea overboard could not afford, because it would significantly jeopardise the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, the release of a hostage in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a morning for the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasko attempt to free the hostages with force.
The diplomats' prisoners were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations led by the Algerian government.
Their work at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Tranian sentimentality.
The debate in Iran made a significant contribution to Jimmy Carter's death with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that America has brought about a small victory.
Six employees escaped from the embassy immediately before the office.
After difficult peripeti, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran, while it helped extravagant cover stories - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film staff, which in the country watched the location for making sci-fi large film.
Combination of genres
The plan that was designed by an expert on the “exfiltration” - Tony Mendez, required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, held a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been classified for a long time, the film comes out of Tony Mendez's memory.
Afflect's movie is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, also called the \"caper movie\", the story of an outraged piece, an example of a series of Danny's partners.
This is how moods change in the film - on the one hand documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic photo of events and the way the same situation was presented in the film - the great differences are not in it).
On the other hand, the isolated passions from Hollywood, which were negotiated with irony and a slight superstit.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - they can take out the situation in the suits at table tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck made a remarkable recovery of careers.
From the dream actor he became a respected director, and his acting stopped being the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first time Affleck's film that doesn't play in Boston's home director.
Cit for the atmosphere of the site was among the characteristics of the director's older films increased above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows him in Argu, where Tehran is playing - Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets, during reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time causes the emotions of confusion and infidelity, which occur when there is a chastisement of history.
Similar effects of Affleck and his coworkers are achieved in the scene of the thought (false staff on the Teheran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that the story that was told does not actually offer power in the sense of filming scenes.
It is almost successful to work with, sometimes it will think of something - it does not go so elegantly there (the scene in which the threatening crisis on the Teheran airport reverses the call in America and the homage after the morning works quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga is, however, the dissatisfaction resulting from the necessity to show too many works in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood coworkers, but their characters would deserve more space and are far from one.
Affleck's film has a bit of a dramatic move, it's a picture that can be watched with a mild interest, appreciate the implementation of even retro style that attracts the thrills of the 1970s.
It'll only take a hard time.
As a reminder of one yet certain way of living history and evidence of how overreaching the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovniplatky.com, which annually declares the survey of the most abnormal bank fee, has now decided to declare the competition for the “unfulest regulation or ideas from the EU workshop”
The last event that the EU is planning to adopt a 40% quota for women in the lead of large European companies, says the Law organizer Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women is already in place.
Women have so far been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risk to insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulation also includes mandatory mixing of biofuels into fuel, which, as a result of damage to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances or a Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has significantly betrayed eggs this year.
Critics previously faced a real ban on using the term orange butter or decommissioning of classic light bulbs from sales.
Quality bananas are supposed to have 14 centimeters
The EU Apparat often decides under the pressure of one or the trade or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels tend to defend certain states or groups of states (so the Czech Republic now and the threat of the veto promotes the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality in the Union had to reach a length of at least 14 cm and did not have to report the ‘anonymous curve’ in the Union.
The European Commission has prevented itself from harmonisation of the current unscrupulous national standards that have made trade more difficult.
The EU's fruit and vegetable standards have already become soft with regard to the resistance of some states to the fact that the existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in an annex may also be an EU regulation last year, according to which it must be required to warn the children of less than 8 years of age without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to American research, according to which balloons are among toys leading the cause of the death of children to suffocate.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to 14 years of age while blowing into the pilgrimage freckles.
Chicken ideas are born at home
At the same time, the rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia for Greece in view of the sensitivity of the topic and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server Bank fee.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire was nominated in addition to some of the above absurdity, the Union regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established maximum volumes of food stocks that could have been present in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the determined volumes for preserved mushrooms, which threatened it with high fines.
The organizers of the survey also considered the idea to pay some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of making subsidies upon request to obtain subsidies.
However, these ideas did not take place in Brussels, but in Prague.
We're being bullied by not having the sea.
We ask the European Union for a refund,\" said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he claimed that we had a lot of grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the State had full warehouses which he had to export.
The EU, according to Palase, was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission came out of the Czech Republic by organising a trend for the purchase of grains from countries that have no access to the sea.
The grant was awarded by the Ministry of Local Development, chaired by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to file an application for a grant from Brussels.
EU: The bilateral regulations are the exception of
While the regulation is easy for Member States to face criticisms, the EU's efforts to regulate, while at the same time working more effectively and developing the whole Union, a number of experts deserve more recognition.
The more serious problem is, according to experts, for example, to draw EU subsidies to projects that have neither a sign in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have forced Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The disease between Bohemia also encourages that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, not always succeed in this match.
Although after the six-year struggle with the Germans and the Rakušans, Czechs have chosen the sign of the olemous shapes, but the local rum, whose tradition is in our 19th century, had to be renamed to the earth.
The nameing of rum can only bear products from cane distillation and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, for example, the Carlovarian dryars, the Pogrołický and the Trzebňská Kapr and the Žatetický hops have already been found in the company of world-famous cheeses.
The EU’s protection mark can then also be proud of the pardubic mercenary and magnesium tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm amateur, says Okamura.
Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without a problem, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can't see the country selling out the last 20 years, as thieves run around, people are increasing their taxes and age of retirement.
I wasn't supposed to be a politician.
But seeing something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been 40 and I'm an independent impartial, I have no choice how to influence things than to run for a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but you went to Hrad.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who elected you?
All along, I said I'm going to go into the fight for the Castle as a result in the Senate elections.
Later, I explained that if I was elected Senator, I would run for president.
However, my aim is not a function, the function is how I can perform my vision.
That's why I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The problem is, not only is that as a nation we're putting in a pub and on television, but that we're going to walk everyone who wants to try to change.
This is what the media that dehonesate and who have the right freedom to lie with freedom to do this.
Maybe I was told I was paying the journalist or being a consultant to Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go to your vision.
You went out to fight for the Castle with the physical and criminal responsibility of politicians and back-of-life assets over 20 million.
You have to change the law to that.
But as president, you don't have that authority, and only Senate as a whole can design laws.
How are you gonna figure this out?
When I was a citizen lobbying for being free of business, it worked.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from left or right, he approves, and that keeps the citizens.
As an independent impartial, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without partial squeezing and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country, from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing person or a left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me to the left.
It's not important to me whether a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
I don't care if anyone's left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is suggested by KSČM or ODS, and I will still be against the wrong idea.
You're black when someone says you're a populist.
But you don't prove that to me what you said?
When you form a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they've been talked about by important experts.
But without the support of the parliament, there's only a word left to you.
And you don't get enough in politics for long time.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them that you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to get it done.
If I were elected president, there is no problem of organising television direct transmission, where I request the President of the parliamentary parties to legalise material and criminal liability for politics, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they would have to tell her if they didn't want to.
If there's a strong personality that's going to name a nebula, it's possible to push on a political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, that was the service of public pressure.
I'm straight to say I'm an amateur, I'm not even a genius, I'm not intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find an ally.
I've just started politics and I'm going to try to get most of the support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work out, I'm gonna end up in six years, and I'm going back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, which is why I'm surrounded by a number of known people, whether they'd also run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jančura, the one who refused to do the job.
So at least I supported the investment journalist Jan Lorenzo, who was tearing up the frauds with light fuel oils.
I was running for people to be really dissatisfied, but now I'm on the scales.
Sixty percent of people didn't vote and those who went were usually elected representatives of the stablishment.
We're just two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will become difficult.
Yet I will fight for my vision, such as the direct choice of mayors or captains.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to check the pure past of every potential party, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't have the money for even the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 on my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
Are you talking about property confessions, what's yours?
Private property is estimated at about 60 million.
I've got about 25 million in Prague, a ten million apartment, another eight million apartment, a collection of works in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Superb code for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, Aston Martin, because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time he fought against badness and bad guys.
You drive Aston Martin, you got $60 million property, and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it much.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for a campaign.
Do I owe you that?
I've already hit a $2.5 million campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is that my program is probably not that interested.
And I don't have to pay the campaign off my own.
The campaign costs will essentially cover what I'll receive from Senator's salary.
But I wouldn't have survived him, for example, I couldn't pay the son of an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd lower these activities?
But that doesn't relate to pay rises.
As I promised, my activities were partly deluded.
For example, my representative will become the one on the road in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live out of something.
How much business have you been used to taking for a month?
Two hundred and 400 grand, which I take next.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
You can find the full interview in Saturday's issue of rights.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - for example Spipsis and recently built Hora books - 2 photos
The building seems happy to me, it looks futuristic. Finally again it is interesting to see something interesting,\" says Lisette Verhaig, which goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in a very big business, says: “All things, this house is nice -
But I'm asking what we need a library for today.
They all have Internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old-style libraries are volunteered to go to any of them today, right?
Spikenisse, a place close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities, which is not worth even visiting, holds a special record.
This community with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, the decision fell a few years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven fine painted ribo-zobeton miniature fiction bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, but it wasn't a dizziness.
And so city councillors knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Wines Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio of MVRV, master of insanely bold column charts and builder of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted a matter with common calm and at a competition meeting in 2003 appeared with five books under the arms and a glass on the face.
And while the Commission looked even more deeply around herself and shrouded its shoulders, it was the second Maas gift to himself by the size of the size and its activistically dedicated speech that ended the words of the \"Dear town municipality.\"
So this is my proposal for the Horu of the book in Spikniss, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for EUR 30 million.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and serial houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora's books were awarded the second place:Best Library of NL 2012-
The project is also nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town gray, which could not yet offer more than a post-blue walking zone and an unusually ugly town hall, for whose white fasad you would expect a dairy plant, is a bit richer than modern architecture.
Above all, Spipkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
Long way to the book
First impression: a reader's Eldodododo under the hatch of cheese.
The elevator runs through the massif of the mountains, but you will discover real spatial and reader passions when you are walking down topography.
From all sides of the glassed interior is bright and transparent, the floor of the burnt bathroom and elegant street arches clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books, books everywhere.
“Normally standing racks with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is mostly inseparable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have built a classic spatial configuration upside down and the space for the reader has been removed from the inside.
The interior of the Upper Book is widely used: in the center there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home technology.
The special pleasure is the black shelf on books that are once covered by walls, one parapet, and some other stairs.
Look, the structure and the smell are affecting you.
Even the architects and construction engineers will intervene over the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work here with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, the head of the project in the town village of Spiknisse, on the question of the Standard magazine.
And so we ran into an appropriate agricultural waste product in one of the French farms one day.
For many years it has been used in greenhouses and in fields in the Netherlands as a basis for the roots of millimetre rouno of synthetic matter.
It's cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, and then it's frozen to throw it into the volume waste.
For the library was rouno - for the first time in such quantity - pressed on plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
By means of a heat and pressure called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colored in dark, homogenous and difficult material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoes.
After 105 steps you'll get to the top.
At the end of nearly 500 metres long footing you will be rewarded in a literary coffee shop not only with fantastic views of the city, but also in Dutch croquets and frikus in flowers.
You are concerned about the atmosphere, but especially about the proper humidity of air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
“You would not believe it, but this house is, despite many glass areas, a demonstration project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
He turns up and cold ground heat.
Although the mountain of the books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in only briefly, even in sunny days.
The wide glued wooden hangers, which stand round for glassed facades, serve as a coating and captures a large part of sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
He can handle the rest of it fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic from IT gate, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogrde, who even refers to Boekenberg as a “a long-awaited soul” - Spibchenisse.
Reason: Every citizen of the city was invited to open up a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This was the first to be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped library, which currently accounts for 70 000 pieces.
The concept has proved itself.
The police are completely filled.
“There is nothing worse than an empty library,” says the architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, every citizen has a relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just in the ornament.
This led to the MVR in the royal discipline, which is referred to as creating identity in the professional corgon.
Spickenisse wrote literature history.
No matter how young he is and not educated.
This is finally the starting point for identity.
Shabo: “The Germans must play a bigger role -
Germany abstained in its decision to accept Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Shabo, Berlin is the one that balances on the narrow edge of diplomat.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first announced at the beginning of the week that it would vote against the proposal for an observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin stopped voting.
Why?
Stephen Shabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious because of his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support an American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it was the setting up of a summerless zone.
That's where NATO's put it.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is about changing its foreign policy, from a policy that was so controlled by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think that they are only living in their role, but they are on their way to more “normal” foreign policy.
Foreign policy they have in France or in the UK.
In particular, what does the ‘normal’ foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows preparedness to be taken into account in the case of national interests and attitudes independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, namely export and its relations with certain areas, including Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are, to a certain extent, non-economic interests of other powers, and therefore, Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests have an impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First of all, Germany has a large residential area in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf of Persia.
Therefore, it must be careful not to scare the public, but neither the elites in Arab countries.
Anyway, he plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to add too much meaning to it, it's not a very unilateral relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations in any way.
Did Germany's relations with the US have been damaged when Germany, in the case of both important decisions, was voted, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the US, there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think it was such a dramatic break as it was on Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even make it difficult to respect.
This indicates that it must be considered to be an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. made it clear for the vet.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think Obama's government may have a significant understanding of European attitudes.
But, of course, as a result of the political situation there, this attitude cannot be held publicly.
I think that differences in opinions are really not as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and the Ministerial President of Netanyjahu, Obama is not very excited about Netanyjahu's politics at all.
It is difficult for Germany to bring its close relationship with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the positions of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes this harder for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans to have a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not happening at present.
They can't be part of the wider line, and instead they have to move things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does he even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany adopts a greater role, they arise against the German mood.
It doesn't make it easier for the Germans.
It is an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to different neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European policy is now falling constantly, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's awkward for them and it's going to make them even more unfaithful - c'est la vie!

- Brand Protection - China: when Puma and Armani are at once Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What is Armani Polo?
This hides the marking that is officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual owners of the brand do not sue them.
And even then, it's not clear whether they can get to the law.
“For a stranger, it is increasingly difficult to protect his brand in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
He'll land on my desk every week a new case.
A few more letters for the counterfeiters to sign their marks.
This is how Lu-Gucci becomes of Gucci, for example, and instead of Prada, they're keeping Prada-Kny registered.
In this way, German companies are also legally copied, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods.
Pattloch opens the order number records in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company had to protect the trade brand Zegna DF Puma. A fine name that parasites even at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese masters of the world are in copying and breaking intellectual property.
In large cities there are several business houses where counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases are different, but from the mandate of his mandants, it follows against the fact that Chinese companies receive entirely the right to use the mark which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it \"Bang Mingpai\" the associated brand.
This word focuses on “Bang Dakuan”
These are the women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
\"It damage the business, we must persevere it,\" says Pattloch.
-The mark is broken, the sole position disappears, the image damage is huge -
The financial losses and the judicial costs of the undertakings affected go to millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to CLSA's research company, China has a total of EUR 15 billion over the third year of the largest luxury market for goods and the market that grows as rapidly as possible.
However, the deletion of doubt records in the stamp register is difficult to achieve and it costs something.
The management may extend to nine years, with an uncertain result.
The Pattloch relates to cases where the court rejected the action, because the term under appeal became the case after a long period of time the ‘market reality’.
If the defendant has bad luck, he has to pay the posteriator still because he damaged his mark in China, he says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
We know the cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the producer of the construction machines Sana, a company recently taken over by the German producer of pumps for the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
Therefore, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star today.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. Spor was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
A manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the other way around.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although CTMO's brand office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too small numbers of employees and space.
But last year, he reportedly returned the work process from an emergency situation to a normal standard.
For example, the number of unworked proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
Something to do with it is expensive
As often as it is in China, it's impressive numbers.
Last year CTMO was delivered more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third of more than 2010.
That's a record, and it means China's next month is leading a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - total 5,5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion jüan were selected for fees.
This simply means that each registration is worth 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth several times to start the dispute, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
This company has been fighting against the Chinese posteriator for more than seven years.
While the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitated automotive parts has been cancelled.
However, the counterfeiter still secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg mark.
We would have forgotten it ourselves, because in Germany the last name cannot be protected, says Hanna Wetzler, Chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
CTMO also rejected the opposition of the Munich company.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was able to do the right, but the opponent in the dispute is still fighting today.
You need to be very careful.
Now the matter is discussed at the Supreme Court.
He has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionality of the courts.
But he also says: “The driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves -
The internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company's archive they had to even look at 100 years of old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered to the counterparty in vain a high six-digit amount in euro - in order to settle the dispute.
“ From that you see what this means to us,” says Wetzler.
It is threatening that the danger from the Far East will also hit Europe.
And in case the immitators are able to secure their unprotected markings.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign a sign of Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This business area has long given up, yet it has been able to reverse registration.
“You need to be careful,” says Wetzler.
He also advises the German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not sufficient for foreigners to rely on international trade marks. Foreigners should, in any way, rely on protection, also in China, say Wetzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg is in the last act of his drama with the mark, then he will probably have to pay the counterparty a license fee for his own name, he explains Wetzler.
Or we'll be pressured from the market in a disputed segment.
World Day Fighting AIDS: assing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, they try the Imbongi congregation and in Swaziland, they have the joy of orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometres.
First there's ass: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins looking for a tact floor and they're quick to find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then they slowly raise up the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - insist, mom and each other.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he joins his vocal gestures.
It's Monday night in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg will try a new song.
It came to 50 singers and singers between 23 and 69, from researchers of human genetics to the home.
“Om'Obani” is not an easy song, each congregation voice has another text and yet in a very foreign language - a zul that speaks 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and the parts of Swaziland.
Assistance for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations Programme for AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people living around the world who are infected with HIV.
Of which, 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland who died of AIDS.
HIV is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans who died of AIDS, in Esitjeni village, he found a society called Voices for Africa's patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second degree school.
A patronage can be taken for 15 or 20 euros per month.
He guarantees the kid's school, school uniform, and one hot meal a day at Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means in the language of evil, the story storyteller, or the one who praises,
No one can speak in this space, just sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has been practicing songs in this foreign soft talk, and sometimes it also brings them back to where they originally come from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, the village of Esitjeni is in the north-east of the Soviet kingdom, which depends on the density of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some of them still in simple clays or salty pigs, and a lot of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they have caused you to have HIV.
In Esitjeni it is seen in a small amount of the stasis of the entire Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest expected life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male forefather, which proves to reduce the risk of disease by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity in itself. There is no rare thing that they die in less than 30 years.
This village discovered the congregation on a common path to Africa in spring 2005. Above all, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets that were missing not only parental care, but they clean up everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed school education, there is no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was still a private deployment of individuals who allowed a child to send to school in a few euros a year and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later he was founded by the Society-Voices for Africa, who has been looking for orphans to parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally since then.
The fact of sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted disease?
The bacterial SPI belongs to syphilis, chlamydia and cape (gonorea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papilomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mushrooms and spruce belong to the parasitarian SPI.
Who belongs to the most affected groups?
Syphilis and capillac are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
Robert Love's Constitution is based on at least four of the five cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted by sexual relations between men.
Heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, lymphoma infection, trichonoea, candidosis (gas), cap and human papilomavir.
HIV is relatively low between heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV people seem to be this group.
Among juveniles, chlamydi infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections relate to young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, among the youths, human papilomavirs often occur among us.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syphilis is more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIVs has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011, about 2700 cases were available.
That's about one decimal less than a year before.
What symptoms point to sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the field of genitalia, difficulty in motivating, discharge, abdominal pain and blistering or brading.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore will not be observed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Dangerous diseases may reduce condoms, however, they do not offer 100% protection.
For originators of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted and infections from impurities and close physical contact.
That is why experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent alteration of sex partners.
In case of early diagnosis, most of the SPIs can be cured and prevented later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charity gifts, and, last but not least, to honorers who make the congregation sing all over Germany, will gather some money.
We have already sent about EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni,” says the President of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is administered in the village of Zowa Promini, a self-confidence woman who can settle.
He also asks that the lonely children find shelter, for example, for some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as they say in the language of evil to old women, is the resistance of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and they try to get the kids to get to school every day in time in uniforms.
Children who don't have any more go to Khanyisil's shelter, a lonely woman who pays the company as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
“Voices for Africa, in addition, established the school of sewing, built two couriers and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had allowed to test HIV.
Even if the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has sex to do with sexuality,
Actually, it's pretty strange in the country where the King officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarchy black Africa, King Mswati III, is known by its immoral lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is, among other things, guilty that HIV virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But even many migrant workers who have spread the virus around the earth.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact -
To at least a little support for cultural exchange, the Imbongi congregation travels once in two, three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting, trust in the future and confidence of black people, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in black people's language - this award brings not only the mood and joy, but also the tears of many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village is hardly on the maps, the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is light,” people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is now a footnote of 8733 kilometres from here, to assimilate singers in the test room at Bergheimer Straße, you see that light shines here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
Sonda Messenger found evidence that Mercury's ice is on the planet.
Ice blanket could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) has shown the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies, published on Thursday by the expert magazine-Science-
Sonda Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet that lies in a permanent shadow.
This is reportedly at least 30 centimeters and maybe even 20 meters strong.
This water came from the comet apparently, or perhaps even from asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leaders of scientists working on Messenger Sonda, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsia.
However, findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life have gotten into other areas of the solar system.
Sondy, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, unmarked earthmen, are taking part in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they came to Earth's images, a small window to an infinite distance.
The film comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at Max Planck Institute.

One of Hubble's largest and most powerful images of the telescope: the vortex galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxy, according to their discoloration, become real works of art.
The event published by the European Southern Observatory shows a number of thousand light years away from Trifid's nebula in the Sąhvězka.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word ‘trifidus’ (a divided into three parts, three-klan), because the dark penis of dust divides the heart of this starry birthplace into three parts.
In the Middle Ages of Hadonoš, astronomers photographed the predominance of space precipitation: in the distance of 400 million light years away from Earth, the wife of two passing galaxys and must inevitably reach the collision.

Also this starry cloud, associated with the nebula Rosette, is still born by new young stars. It is a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
There is no dust in this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe it was only created shortly after the Big Bang when there was predominantly hydrogen in the whole universe.
Our views to the universe: the most important telescopes
The long term was probably invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo, he used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to increase - and the views they mediatize are still deeper.
The world's largest remote view was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope on the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had an average of five meters.
In the U.S., the Large Binocular Telescope is standing in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8,4 metres.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge.
Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to settle costs.
Yet its diameter is about 11 metres.
An advantage of the cheap way of construction: the telescope is provided by a high angle hook, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high acceleration of light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the greatest mirror telescopes of the world.
By means of a radiotelescope in Arecibu (Portorico) the scientists in the universe are searching for alien signals.
This radiotelescope has an average of 305 metres.
At the “Search for Extraterrestrical Intelligence” (SETI) - search for alien intelligence - can help every computer owner who makes his calculation performance available.

Very Large Telescope stands here and honors his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can brighten even the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large perspective is also planned for the Chilean Observatory of the ESO.
His main mirror is to have 42 metres full and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Keck's telescopes on Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer just two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also covers the universe and the Subaru and IRTTF telescope.
Also on Mauna Kea is to create a new giant telescope with a 30-meter diameter of mirrors.
Here you can admire him in the picture.
However, the most important impressions of the universe in the middle of Hubble's cosmosque telescope.
The tour of distant worlds has been providing us since April 24, 1990.
The Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for since March 2009 after extrasolence planets - especially after those resident.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The picture is documented with the latest preparation prior to the launch of Kepler Space Telescope.
The space telescope James Webba (JWST) will be fired into space first in 2018 on board Ariane5.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has an average of 6,5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and the galaxy in the Big Bang.
Scientists say there's ice on the south end of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, because the Messenger is far closer to the northern pole around this planet.
Radar measurements have been showing for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger's son, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to be around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in the Bible’s age.
There's even a long-lasting museum.
Looking for a lead in a country where 97 years of people are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in the Bible’s age.
There's even a long-lasting museum.
Looking for a lead in a country where 97 years of people are still relatively young.
By the way, we can call the wild romantic.
Microbus flies along the road with many turns along the densely forested hills, precious rivers and simple Sels.
Everything is green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, here is the narrowest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here there is a Canadian ethnic group of Talyš, which is not known too much, except that it speaks perfectly to the Persians and the Azerbaijan and has a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is chasing too monumental architecture from the Soviet times that fall into the picturesque mountain landscape of some sort of accident.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. The arrival from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too difficult.
Eight hours are required for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-proud.
The fairy tales that the country owes to infest in the Caspian Sea have not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Fatutajev (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
“The Great Eurovision Prize was celebrated in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year,” says Fatulajev.
She's the director of the museum of long term, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented life of almost eight dozen Talysans from the surrounding area, which are over a hundred years old. Fatulajev shows black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, the strong star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep Müslümov, which was reported to be 168 years old.
The birth certificate, of course, does not exist.
And given that the oldest man with evidence was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems to be quite doubtful.
“He was born in 1805 and died in 1973,” explains Fatulajev.
This man was supposed to be married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he said he still had a daughter.
So did Torali Müslümov have been mistaken at his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a Germanologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of flying people in Central Asia.
“In some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, many people of the high age are living,” says Scholz, “so Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men living in the Sardinia.
However, no scientific evidence of age cannot be provided for the missing grounds, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day of a broken butter glass
However, the fact is that people around Lerik enjoy the Bible’s age very often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why does he live here in the south of so many flying people?
Azerbaján guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special genes of the Talys.
On the contrary, Director of the Museum of Fatuljev believes that this is a nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysians who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink the glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, it does not seem very credible from a bromatology point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Centemirana, a tiny settlement near Lerik, living in Rubaba Mirzajev.
In 97 years, he's still relatively young for this geographical distribution.
Mirzajev, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the ground with a buttershake she's unattractively fluctuating.
There are eight people under one roof, among other things one of the sons of Miraevy and the daughter, both of them are already grandparents.
There are also two small children around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical abdominal glass-armada -
The white teeth of Mirzavy form a perfect line and hides long dark blonde copy, which proudly reveals her son.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like they kept their color.
\"I've never used shampoo like that,\" says Mirajeva.
A month's pension is enough to live.
She's always eating just what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven't bought food in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then he tells me about his man in the army.
It was the worst thing in World War II.
But everything was improved when the universe took over the “loved father, Gejdar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds weird out of the mouth of an old woman.
But a cult that is made around the character of the father of the nations who ruled his country as a dictator in Azerbaijan does not know the limits.
He was in power until 2003, then he took over his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer need.
Mirajeva receives a 230 manata pension every month (about the same amount in euros). This is on the ratios of the turnover from which it can be used well.
And he may be right, even a long - haired son of Miraev, who is now experiencing great importance in our culture.
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, sealed and happy.
Unless it's a reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The concept of human rights is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Disturbed demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the deep spread of the country.
The focus is on a future Sharia-based constitution.
The Egyptian president didn't spare a path.
We have to create a transition.
\"And for doing so, I am responsible for people and before God,\" he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to Christian Kopts, liberals, enlightened by Muslims and secular people.
All of them, still hopelessly angry in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the ‘God’s State, out in the Nile of the mighty Muslim fraternity.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he temporarily limited the competence of the constitutional court and extended his efforts to protect the revolution.
However, what 61-year-old engineer wants, who has the degree of doctor of the American university in South California, really saves, even the world is not clear about this.
Is justice supposed to be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which are the heads of the Constitutional Assembly with the overweight of Islamists, quickly approved in the 15th hour night maraton, partially raise concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on the principles of Islamic law -
But what does the principle mean?
That was, and it is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this inconvenient formula and the associated legal free space to use it for the stricter interpretation of the batch.
At the very least, it illuminates the newly added paragraph: In all matters concerning Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that the kerrus will carry out supervision of the legislation, which would bring justice to a real withdrawal of his ministry.
There are many interpretations in the draft Constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak’s government to suppress the opposition.
After the downfall of the dictatorship, there were 11 000 civilians in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, the State should also protect the ‘right nature of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values.’
This is legally designed so that the content of film art and literature could even be controlled by this paragraph.
It means nothing but censorship.
In writing, there is no paragraph in writing that explicative equality between men and women is limited.
Another paragraph thus prohibits the shame or excuse of the prophet Mohammed and his ambassador.
However, it remains unclear what is disgraced, and how it will be prosecuted.
Similarly, it is doubtful to formulate that it is prohibited - to insult people -
Is it enough in this case that the president's caricature or a joke on the law experts' account?
The matter of interpretation, as many others in this proposal, which Mursi will submit to the signature and will soon be, according to his words, to present to the Egyptians for the purpose of the human vote.
The revolution is back -
For several weeks, opposition to Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered at the Tahrir Square on Friday night in Cairo and promised to destroy the Constitutional Charter before it begins to pay.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdín Sabbáhi, who was placed in third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize carrier and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed said that the proposal of the Constitution belongs to the point of history.
By means of the short news services, Twitter accused the supporter of Mursi that they would like to perform a \"powder against democracy\" -
“If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down,” said Jasir Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished,” quoted the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Chálida Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to look after the referendum, thus becoming invalid.
\"The Koran is our constitution--
A well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared a reborn, but with caution not at the Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Cairo University.
She took part in many exposed women and Salafists who called: ‘The people demand the application of God’s law.
They called upon Mursí: ‘The cleanness of the earth; and they assured them: ‘The Koran is our constitution.’
The fight for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrír, where everything began, would probably create a state similar to civil war.
Apparently, Mursi's supporters didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim fraternity declared that the opposers and the advocates of the draft constitution were loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people at the electoral arena decide which direction my country is to go.
A majority is considered to be a certainty in favour of the proposal of Islamists.
The word 'human rights' shall not occur at least once.
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, is dedicated to Hafize Abu Sa'du.
The eight-year advocate of human rights and the President of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) voted for the members of the Muslim fraternity when they were behind Mubarak in prison or were in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are unemployed to him.
He was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
- And now there are no words in the new constitution 'human rights' or once, - complains in an interview for'Welt am Sonntag'
Mursi's expansion of power to all three forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous accusation against democratic rules of the game and lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
The place for the president of the civil society to strengthen it is seriously canceling it, - complains about Sa'da.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned and international communities, which are following the match of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get him out of here.

Norwegian coffin: The world’s most smelling fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country’s success mystery be associated with a local appetite for extravagant fish?
Take a couple of overrated cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
That's how you get some paralyzing smells of Austria, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and in the air it hangs all the conscious smells.
The cancer is a salted cane in water for up to one year - depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and starts to be cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes are meeting at a festival dedicated to what to say best to the most wonderful food.
“You will eat it raw and then you will drink it with a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, the local professional firefighter, but also the so-called “Rakfisk general”, who is responsible for the course of the festival.
People eat small cubes of fish all around us and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit rather than a rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drink can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a bit of sushi, which was on a long way by bus.
Cancer is a product of a very different time when it was poor in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish went into the airtight barrels with water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well caught, they pulled out and ate - the senses were doubtful of alcohol.
Before just one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to large amounts of work, high earnings and extensive care systems.
The inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival, which was much richer than Norway before recently, are flowing to the country for work.
The coffin is viewed as something important, unobtrusive, even though it is a rather persuasive part of the Norwegian past.
These include more expensive food on the market.
Even though expensive is all - a little glass of beer or a sandwich will make you 9 pounds (14 dollars) a piece.
Norway often does not get into global reports - and most people seem to do so.
Anders Breivika's name, right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is what people still mention with the neut.
Instead, the shooting is called “the event of July 22“
Norwegians can only hard to believe that one of them was capable of such brutality and murder in their peaceful country.
Norway's current wealth is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
“But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,” says when we are putting plates with a depleted coffin of our waiter Anna, who with his long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of nordic welfare.
We're, as they say, prudent people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of these people, is absolutely wonderful.
We don't get out of the way, we don't like the show.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - besides a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a specific fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to a global financial crisis threw away money that they didn't have, Norwegians had stringes on their purses firmly covered.
“When we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
- And eating rakfisk, - he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow on the front of something to eat - I'm sick of cancer.
This fate burger is definitely something else, and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is back here.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where the coffin is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They've got a connection with a live television transmission in which the moderator with a butterfly surrounded by a coffin plate.
It's like Eurovision's piano competition.
- What score you have for the best fish there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene -
- Here's our score, Havard.
It's called applause and laughter.
A man falls out of a chair, possibly able to aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes of all those fishes.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start
As President Enrique Pena Nieto is approaching, Will Grant of the BBC is looking at the challenges facing and at the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that is also encircled in the best times, steel walls have been set up with several key routes to the capital and causing road chaos.
However, the aim was not to prevent those who are arriving in order to get to work, but to prevent protesters from coming to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Presidential serp and take over the leadership of the nation.
It's a challenge.
Mexico, at the time of the office of Felipe Calderon, has led well in economics, but the country is in the cracks of the drug war, which has already estimated 60 000 lives in six years.
\"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,\" said President Pena Neto to President Barack Obama at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he shakes his hand with the American president, President Pena Nieta won political experience as Governor of his home state Mexico.
The ideas of a new leader are different even in his old home, a people's and vast state surrounded by a capital city.
A direct man.
For example, in Valle del Bravo in rural town, they remember him well.
Citizens assign to him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city after one of the new highways which Pena Nito has left to build. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the bountiful and deep roads that were here earlier.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
\"We expect to bring a real and lasting change,\" says the friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, Member of state to the side of President Pena Nieta, the Party of the institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope in the interesting and real changes in the field of security and the economy that our countries so necessarily need.
Following the indiscretion of 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed away by Vicent Fox.
Ambassador Olvera admits that after 12 years outside of Los Pinos's presidential palace, many are expected inside of Enrique Pena Nieta.
And he refuses to comment on the opposition characterizing the new President as a person without material content.
He's a very direct person, very busy with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that has many people from its former governor.
In Unhualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Not, there can be no contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo more apparent.
Located under the highway entrances in many reminds the suburbs of Mexico itself.
And the problems in self-righteous communities are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called to help manage drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially palpable, is violence against women.
Only in the last two years were in desert places next to the huge waste dumps dumped by dozens of murdered women.
At the time Pena Nieto was Governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, which is much more than in the nominally violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with killing innocent women.
In a better case, Pena Nieta's critic says that he failed to deal with women's murder in an adequate manner.
And in worse cases, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical for the lost neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
\"When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone washed her body,\" she recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of a hit, and there was already postmortem stiffness.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana is looking down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross on which there is one word: ‘Justice’
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what was given to them.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, troublemaker, and a scavenger.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
But it can't be right when so many mistakes have occurred and I forget it,\" he says.
The strain President Pena Nieto receives on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime and the new president has promised to be his priority for the period of action in the office.
\"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor,\" says Valle del Bravo Member of PRI Olvera.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad do not fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong treatment, he says the D.A. Attorney.
The military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claims regarding gross custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected based on gross treatment with Manning in prison.
Private's charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest escape of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many possibilities to complain about the gross treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Asden Fein, in a cross-conception of Private Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that the records of the weekly visits Manning had with the officers of the unit during nine months of ties in Quantico in Virginia do not show any complaints about mistreatment.
The cross-extinguishment during the hearing carried out on a proposal for defence to reject a case conducted against Manning due to gross treatment at the time of the bonding period, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in custody.
The analysis of military intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, the military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, went through the forms that officers filled out after a meeting with Manning at the Quantic Chamber Prison, where he was held under the regime from July 2010 to April 2011 with increased security.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that he assessed the treatment of his guards as ‘excellent’ and assessed overall treatment in the device as ‘big professional’.
The forms do not show any complaints about the wrong treatment, even though Officer Manning had just asked directly how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed his doubts regarding various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke with him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
“No problems have been written,” said Manning.
The Judge named Denise Lind also asked why he did not complain to his person in January 2011 when meeting with the committee assessing suicide thoughts that he had expressed several months earlier in his form.
Manning replied that during this meeting, it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the regime of injury - prevention -
The military said that for him this restrictive regime (one degree under the surveillance regime because of suicide) used it to protect and protect others.
“I wanted the guardians in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it,” Manning said.
Manning testified on his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a prison prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quray in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once passed out because of heat.
He said that he was not allowed to know what was going on with him and what was going on in the surrounding world was very depressing.
“My world was only on the base of Arifjan, on the cage,” said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning claimed that he spent most days on arrival in Quantica (minimum 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, a suit, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or lying was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the lights from the outside side of the cell in his eyes.
He said if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint on the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he raised in the Thursday statement concerning the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in her cell at Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other fellows at the morning count.
Manning said that he wasn't allowed to cover his cover at the count.
During the fifth hearing conducted by Judge Manning, he claimed that no one had given him orders from his guardians that he had a blanket that he could hide, put aside, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
Thursday Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show an officer that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could use the belt from his underwear or his references to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that the night of his cell was removed from his underwear, his earrings and his glasses.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before the military court, whose beginning is expected at the beginning of the next year, his punishment will be significantly reduced.
The defense stated that it was planning to confess to the guilt of the lower crime and to fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the binding terms as justified.
The Pentagon declared that Manning had been held in accordance with the rules concerning all arrests held in custody with maximum security.
The charges brought against Manning include the help of the enemy, the illegal result of the publication of the intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he's charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My crisis with Mexican-American identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities that are there.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone; they remind them of difficult times, they say.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are lapens between two worlds.
On the last trip to Mexico City, I barely missed the crowd, and I arrived in the area for the agenda of immigrants where I encountered the problem.
The arrow was shown to one of the two fronts: one for “Mexicanos”, “Mexicans” and the other for “Extraneros-Cicincisors”
I was there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and all my life I was called a Mexican--
It's an ethnic shortcut, just like when my friends in Boston are called \"Iry\", and my friends in New York call themselves \"Itals\"
So later I ended up with the term \"Mexican American\" -
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use shorts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish quite well enough to manage both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native spokesperson, and I can't get rid of America's accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood up to the front for “Extranjeros”
I was thinking about the moment that President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama's White House this week.
The programme had usual issues that were being discussed when leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same probability that the Mexicans remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trading block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nito promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even if he had not provided any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that Mexico attacked the United States in 1848 and forced its leader under the threat of arms to translate half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for the Mexicans who think in the centuries, not minutes, the comments are self-evident.
So just a minute after the United States representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezuma's children will climb a war path.
And yet, Mexico is a real challenge for more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and defeats, people whom the country offers opportunities, and others that are not.
The only reason that so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point our family tree was a person, maybe a parent or grandparents who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seemed, this person matched the profile - dark leather, weak education, originating in the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And although we now live an American dream, we go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not a Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's in front of the United States.
And yet we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as a subordinate race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bond to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is only about failure in their opinion.
If our families didn't fail in Mexico, they'd never leave him.
And we would not now be behind a silk tire with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and legally brought to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans are more understood by who they are, and Mexican Americans don't like it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like either part or one.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigress del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, he looks at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relations more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned during my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “provisional ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and press on political leaders to establish relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States of America about how they were dealing with Mexico before one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still do not feel guilty about how they were dealing with their family members in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more - Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an uncertain foundation for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such thing doesn't happen is a waste.
Many buildings have been changed into trouble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, the rockets from Gaza were taken near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelites and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their recent conflict, the Middle East is changing everywhere.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in a state of chaos in the region.
Maybe that'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly path situation.
A war that isn't even won or lost.
At first sight, there are not many reasons to make it better at present.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21st, the fights from this week strengthened the cranes on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic Movement, which has been ruling in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have forced Israel to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most demanding and most human corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And, indeed, Hamas gets the influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its rift rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well consider that time is on their side.
The Islamists all over the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the restored regional power that once was the closest Muslim allies of Israel, was added to the Hamas side, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The almighty people of Hamas say that the Islamic half-months are surrounded by Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the party/milice Hizbollah reigns, through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly encroached to Islamism, can sit Bashar Assad, until Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim fraternity under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the most human and serious Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular despocie, who ruled for 30 years in Egypt until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
Hamas may appear in future diplomacy as a player who cannot be excluded from Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israelite hardline supporters will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology Hamas was placed back in the box.
The Israeli anti-racite system Iron dome has proved its price and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unfamiliar as always. Many European countries also blamed Hamás from the start of the last round of violence.
And above all - Israel has developed, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanjahu, the Prime Minister, who has mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza have been killed by around 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been a relatively calm from suicide bombers, part of the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what may once be the Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality against international law.
At the beginning of the campaign, the Prime Minister of Netanyjah, whose party Likud joined with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of January 22, is in a good position.
Why spoil the exposed Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, they wouldn't fire missiles like they did in Gaza?
It'll be better if we hold them behind the wall and hit them if they stick their heads out.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel too much in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence expenses are higher than the expenses of all its four Arab neighbors combined.
The launch of a new war with local superpowers will hardly help new Arab governments to heal their economy.
President Mursi cooperated with President Barack Obama to stop fire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates a vampire of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination of the barrel with firepowder, which must one day in the areas occupied by Israel, as well as a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
At present, the repression is weakening in the Jewish state of democracy and the demography of this situation is getting worse as the Arab population grows.
Blood attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to pressure Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives outside.
The answer is what reasonable people preach on both sides, most outside worlds, and these newspapers: two states when Israel comes to the territory because of security.
In the short term there is a little hope that the ceasefire will provide pressure from outside at least a little more influence on the deployment of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to assume that weapons supply will be stopped in Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to adopt the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arab outside must also press the match between Hamás and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the UN to create Palestinian State.
President Obama also has his share on how to get Israel to the table.
During his first parliamentary term, he neglected the performance of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems as bold as its introduction into the process.
That's patheticly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means peace settlement between Israel and Palestinians.
The laws on ugly cigarette packaging entered into force in Australia
On unobserved green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, warnings for chickens and sick parts of the body are displayed.
The Australian laws of ugly tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and the logos and colors of brands replaced the common olive green boxes with the gross images of the sick parts of the body and the display of children and newborns with a powerful consequence of smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the box names of labels printed with the same small font is required from Saturday.
This is the toughest regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government claims that the aim is to dissuade young people from smoking by riding this habit of its attractiveness.
Based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking up to 26 years of age, 99% of the chance they never start smoking.
“And in very small children, you can see that they understand a message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product,” says the Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek and quote studies that, for example, have shown that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of chickens in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries are considering taking similar steps.
The tobacco industry strongly lobbyed against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trading on the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unthinkable consequences,” says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobaco Australia.
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring many more of those products that will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packaging from silicone used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding the law to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha claimed that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale dealers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, experts point out the population of social media in the demographic group on which the plan focuses.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from direct sight, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has prohibited Internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign parties.
“If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, there is an insurmountable space for you in which you want to be,” says Becky Freeman, a research worker in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman noted an increase in the assessment of social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the ‘mean Honza’ -
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and he's got the job and created this video or is the marketing company involved?
British American Tobaco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it will impose new regulations than marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and Dominican Republic for assaulting new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are significantly trading.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has conducted talks with other governments who are considering similar laws regarding packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce compulsory warning photographs in 2001.
Now it has spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are considering Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many chickens in Australia resist.
Pictures have no influence on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
“Just pull out your cigarette and stick the box back,” says Victor El Hage when buying a box with photos of tumor in your mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to the uniform boxes, it's harder for him to balance the shelf.
“I've had one hour of cargo, and now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
“The government should simply ban them completely, then we would say, \"OK, that's it, let's close the shop,” he said and threw his hands away.
In a world of constant connections, it's not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving day I was expecting to spend five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half the day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhones (not to talk about duty-free stores).
But some scientists and children’s development experts are increasingly coming with the praise of boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen today, we don't have a chance to enjoy boredom.
So should we support boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that took place with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011.
“In fact, he has a long history,” he said.
There was a Latin sign on the walls of Pompey about boredom coming from the first century of our summer.
And then there's also a question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at research literature and presenting the idea of the target group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience, I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to do it.
Boring from apathy is different by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no need to do something in apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is “distortion of the process of attention associated with the bad mood and the feeling of slowly running time“
Boring can be a lot of reminder of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, boring people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble focusing.
In his study, “The Unengaged Mind: Definition Boredom in Terms of Athens, published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out the earlier experiment by which participants listened to the tape that the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and non-related TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they hardly noticed it, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quieter reported more boredom than the other two groups were in trouble with concentration, but they were not sure why and attributed them to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or palpable task, it may disturb your attention to boredom, said Mark J. Fensk, professor of neuroscientism at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, such as finding the bad parts on the factory line, the distracting music can help you not to study.
In fact, he said, now we know that cutting and pissing, which often looks like a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more appearanceed.
“The survey shows that the children who are allowed to be drilling are more taught and kept more information than those who are forced to sit calm,” said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom - the delay of my flight, the torture speaker, especially the long-term film.
But some individuals have a better chance of bored than others.
For help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s have developed the Stupnic for the Nausea for boredness (Beredom Proneness Scale).
“I have so many interests that I have to do. ”
Through these scales scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to having more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally non-technical.
In 1991 Reed Larson, a professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which nearly 400 teenagers and their parents were contacted seven to eight times daily.
He found that 32 percent of the adolescents said they were bored at school and were doing homework while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentage expression of boredom was now 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knew that “deeping is a high time for boredom,” which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: ‘It is boring for you.’
How research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse habits as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Nuda is the way to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child's bored and you give him an iPad, he's not bored anymore, but he's not gonna learn how to have fun or drive himself, he told Professor Fenske.
A-this separate management is carried out from one situation to another,” said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical to her.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of continuous crushing of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
“We blame her for boreding herself even more, but boredom is painful, a restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,” he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
“In an environment where we are constantly understaffed,” he said, ‘It’s hard to find ways to entertain when the noise is turned off.’
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new Marihuan Act
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orrozco, a student at a higher vocational school and footballer from the South-east Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and pipe that he used on her smoking.
Mr. Orosco said that one bright day he went with some friends in Lamar, on plans near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the police found a marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was given a complaint for drug retention and drug use equipment - minor offenses for every 100 USD fine - and he was determined by the court date.
“They wanted to join us as criminals,” said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on legalisation of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases is more on site than in law.
Hundreds of cases for possession of marijuana were already here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures, cancelled.
The police department ceased to blame adults at the age of 21 and the elderly for holding small amounts, which will be legally authorised after the law entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado said that they would continue to continue with existing cases concerning marijuana, and still accuse people of detention.
At the same time, several cities from the suburb of Denver towards the western mountain vote to prevent the opening of new, state-listed trades with marijuana in their municipalities.
“This issue develops so quickly that I do not know what will happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads of the gossip and regulators in the state of Washington.
And they're looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for growing, manufacturing, distribution and sales - all up until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first in front of most countries in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the licensing of Washington State alcohol.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent that we can follow,” he said.
The Washington Law, called I-502, is effective on December 6th, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not be a state licence system, but legal holding yes.
And there are gloomy mechanical questions that have to be resolved during this period, such as how to export the State Directive concerning the ‘responding approach’ to licensed marijuana with its prohibition of trade in hemps up to 330 meters from school, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
“Never will be more difficult to place a licensed hemp shop than in urban areas, especially in the Saattlu metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Hemp, recently based on research groups.
On November 21st, he sent a police chief Oates from the city of Aurora to his e-mail officers, in which he announced that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute the detention of small amounts of marijuana for every citizen over 21st years old and that the police would stop the charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce municipal laws governing medical marine growers and that they will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld district of North Colorado, the district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a tighter view.
After the vote, he declared that his office would continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push on the users to seek treatment.
At present, there are 56 grams or fewer marijuana between 119 people, even though many of them face further charges.
“Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that have been criminally committed at the time of their arrival,” said Mr Buck in his statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places such as the rural period of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Grand Junction police, the largest city of the county, no longer guilty of holding a small amount.
The district prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all pending detention cases.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time in promoting the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of the Colours voters supported the measures, the introduction of recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the rule of law will never be easy.
And the opposite reaction across the state revealed, in view of this large state-wide green experiment, deep-separance between local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a “cultural barrier” said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant of the possession of marijuana, and the local spokesperson of the National Organisation for Reforming Laws concerning marijuana.
“I have spent so much of my life punishing people that they can still not accept that it is legal,” he said.
As the first countries to face small amounts of marijuana as alcohol are Colorado and Washington on the best way to become national drug test cases.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new borders for legalised sales and, at the same time, there are also anxiously waiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will stand up.
Despite several arrests of marijuana vendors for medical purposes and those who use it, which attracted her attention, the federal government had mostly left trades with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 states in operation.
While anti-aging agents are probably not going to break the door to capture a small drug bag, it is likely that they will allow the state-regulated trades with recreational marijuana authorised by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former drug advisor, President Obama's administration.
Several Barbarad cities do not expect to be followed by federal organs.
Before the election day of some local governments have approved moratoria for any new maritime trade with marijuana, although it will take about a year before any trade can open.
Last week, Montrose's town in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where we give someone a license, and then we’ll have a big federal matter,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our municipality voted against this supplement.
We're looking at what she voted for, unlike what he voted for.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to leave Oxford because I was a conservative.”
For their views, only the university students today are not affected.
I don't remember ever dreaming about studying at Oxford University.
Like my father, my older brother studied at the university that I thought was the world's largest headquarters of knowledge, a modern lead by a Greek symposium that motivates two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the '80s, I was in the '20s until two weeks after I was in Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, pack my bags and rub myself in the first scandal of my life.
My father crashed and cried.
My friends were confused.
\"Evening Standard\" said I gave up because I objected to the love of students in the next room.
The writer A.N. Wilson said that I had left because I was forced to drink from the crowded pots.
The truth was less comic.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cobweb of the duplicity it was both bigoth and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly built adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was the leader of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it off right now.
Just because the latest news suggests that the new generation of students on the right side of the center suffers from a similar persecution.
An institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students in Oxford is so great that a group of these students have been in the same protection for equal rights as gay people, disabled persons and ethnic minorities last week.
Conservative members of the association of the younger years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that, due to their political views, they are actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and are given to them that they are not welcome.
They ask for a position in the university committee for equal opportunities to ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
Their situation was not helped by the recently mentioned documentary TV show of the BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right and on the Right.
The show was introduced by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University - AUCA), who ate Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as a “pure lamb” because of the introduction of a higher school.
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Nottingham University), said Sunday's paper that the “relevant influence on universities is growing.
People believe that we are like Bullingdon Club without even coming together with us.
One-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is “inconvenient,” while the 19th President of the AUCA Stephanie Cherill says that there has been a deterioration in the approach of JCR members to the right people since Wednesday.
“This represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion as well as for the good living conditions of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I began in September 1986, 18-year-old and stunningly shy.
Hated to the Conservative Party was the worst.
A year earlier, the university refused to grant an honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, they would also boast fear.
During the first few days of the initial week, when new students met with each other and professors, I got a taste of a cape that was supposed to come.
I found out that not only dairy professors approve of the intimidation of conservative pupils, but they also want to take part in it.
A policy of mountain strike, privatization and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa has been brought into wood.
My first lecture focused on the translation of the French text from 18th century to English and on what followed I was not prepared.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased),” insert the first paragraph.
It's gone pretty hard.
Professor Pitt, a young man with a face like cake dough, was very bile.
“Thichcherovists refuse to learn French or are just stupid,” he asked.
The other students were getting high.
I've had tears in my eyes.
“I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your free time, that is, if you are not too busy with social matters,” said Professor Pitt.
I returned to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight shoulder knock.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the AUCA.
- I know who you are, - said nice.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone who's suspected of conservativeism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative elements pretend to be labourists.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
Student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (some irony) went to Eton, said: ‘You are the daughter of a fascist pig’
You're infected.
The other students had a note with him.
I was sick, dirty.
“How conservatives love each other, ” he asked one.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals had to feel before the liberal legislation of the '60s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet such thinkers just after dark?
Would I have to change in the labist and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they have developed themselves as a cleansing of ignorance and isolation.
Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was at my university, was the only man who opened up to conservative professor.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an advisor to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who would write her speeches.
Almost wasn't there.
He hated this place for his province and his malicherity and his inclination to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he joined a professor's position at the Bilken University in Turkish Ankař.
\"You won't be happy here,\" he told me.
I started driving from Oxford to my parents' house in London looking for refuge with my unfamiliar metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 40 ’ s, all political opinions were accepted.
But it is the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a dream town.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His eyes were saddened.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired of frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has worsened.
My friend, also the supporter of the Conservative Party, looked at the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The next week, during teaching, when another professor of history declared in absolute importance that I was the enemy of the people, I decided to do the same.
Although I was a student in the middle, I confessed to washing my parents' brains out, and I called them \"old fools.\"
The relief was only short-term.
My father smothered my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's paper every week.
My door was locked.
I was bleeding inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught my first train in London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dead weak guy.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poison in the educational institution.
More tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, of which not only 14 conservative premieres came up, but which also hides by today for the undeserved reputation of a place of equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance rather than glory -
On the occasion of the exhibition -Valentino: the master of fashion work, which was launched this week in London, spoke the ABC with Naty Abascalová, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabel I. Anglické, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentin Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the start of the celebrated retrospectives -Valentino: a master of fashion creation - which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the last 50 years.
“I love this castle,” he says with his unchangeable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which the signor-Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt glamorous with a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3rd, exceeds private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan through the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as a trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from Vogher's town in the north of Italy to the Idol of the international-Bohemian smet -
Having a royal family is nothing wrong.
\"They're at least a dirty tip of cigarettes in a great carpet, like doing some wonderful pop-music celebrities,\" says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy a generous and elegant way.
“All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his cabin in Gstaad,” explains ex-wife, Heini, Thyssen, and close girlfriends of forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
“Valentino always preferred elegance than glory.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazzová is showing Valentina
The designer's charity doesn't even forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
\"It's been a lot of years since we were after one show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, they went to him for dinner.
We were twenty, and there were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger among us.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he was sick and felt his spirit.
All the invited ones could feel important and loving, remembers the top model, which started working with him during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
“It will never come out of fashion, because its designs are artistic works,” it ends.
Exhibition of birth
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but a truly restored grace.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's gallery was converted into a separate 70-meter passage that offers an exchange of roles: a visitor turns into a model and marches the passions to observe the “generalship” of dreams, which wears Valentin's masterwork as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onsis, a costume that was wearing Monica Vitti’s “Noci” or a coat of wool and furry, which belonged to the Emperor Farah Dibaová.
In the public mannequin of September the names of Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, “not to forget it,”
I remember perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests-gillette - and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,\" says Naty Abascal, one of the designer muse.
“I give him more priority for his womanhood and great love for women because it undermines our beauty,” adds the former Duke of Feria.
I like the colors that it uses, brighten up and give - sparkly - face.
The proportions are perfect.
Neither the princess nor the fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be full and had the opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
Finally, she's been waiting for the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentina for a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress with a call, a turret, and a top without a frame.
It was a dream that became real,” says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is a laxant to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocracy whose life is different between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a designer's solemn dress - great carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in themselves -
-Cathes of fashion
The gold ridge of the exhibition at Somerset House are Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Pavel Greece in 1995.
To create these silk clothes of elephants with all pearls, twelve types of different landscapes and a length of four and a half metres were needed four months of work and 25 -holves - as the designer calls his wardrobe.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of specialized press, these dresses represent the gap between top fashions of the end of the 20th century, the return of clients from the high society.
Valentino is now his best example during the years of elite-savoir-être.
Gaavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest prize in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the order of the Black Legs collects as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
“My attention has always attracted his choice, calm, modified and perfect appearance,” acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Count Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was wonderful, and he left no trace on him.
If the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano
Four euros are gambling in the area of Indonesian volcanoes with their life and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur down the steep stone trails.
There are people who are hell for their work, and they are literally who work in hell.
That's the case of Anta Wijay, one of the 400 miners who make money to live up to cheese from Kawah Ijen's volcano in the east of Indonesian island of Java.
That's why every day it's going to have to blow to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gases from the inside of the Earth escape, and when contacting the air goes to a solid state.
After it cuts large blocks of sulphur, which totals up to 70 kilos, it takes them to the shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the steep stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters away, it is only 250 meters away, but the exhausted carrier takes over 40 minutes before they rise up at a speed of iron because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps to avoid slipping and falling into the abyss.
They know that any cracking could have happened to life, as it happened to one French tourist who crashed from the rock of Kah Ijen years ago.
Mountainers in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur that they make
When they're up there, they're taking their way around tourists who photographing them like they're monkeys at circus, and they're tired of taking heavy baskets to the vases that the mining society has placed about something below, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
It is a company of PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid to its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamics and even whitening sugar.
“As 70 kilos are normally carried, we will earn about 46 000 rupees (EUR 3,8 euros) per journey,” explains Anto, who usually graduates three trips a day.
One journey takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but it can make 138 000 rupees (EUR 11,5) per day.
Even though it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what it would make in the field.
The daily wage of the miners is very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees are paid per day and the salary for 14 days is two million rupees (177 euros),\" explains the carrier who used to work on the tourist island of Bali as a leader.
There his salary was 75 000 rupees (6,2 euros) per day and work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is as convincing as he is in Indonesia as he is: ‘I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam’
Anto has asthma, bad breathing, still coughing, and his eyes are irritable by toxic gases
In his 27 years Anto takes three times a day to risk life in Kawah Ijen's volcano, whose age she's already started to choose her tax, even though her face has protected with special masks and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing up, and his eyes are underscored by toxic gases that escape from volcanoes.
That's the price they have to pay to reach their dream.
“I will work for two more years, because I want to open up a business or study Spanish or French,” promises more than a mere English.
This sympathic and intelligent young man who was fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of the carrier.
They share a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and every day it gets up at 2 o'clock in the morning, because the cheese doesn't stop hanging out at night and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto is in a crater and illuminates his way with a small lamp, which he has on a helmet and bought it for his money.
About 400 carriers carry a basket on the shoulder with a hole in the bottom of a crater
Although the company has high income, the mining of the sulphur for cost savings has not been managed or provided to the carriers working on their own and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from the photo shoot-up fee, which together with the ticket for 15 000 rupees (1,2 euros) pick up guarders of the natural park from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mullahs.
“This work is for cattle, and not for people,” says Madrusin, a permanent 42-year-old carrier, who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will last his work - as long as he can - because he needs money to train his three sons between 18 and 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Although the sulphur burning the throat and smothers in the eyes, when the wind turns unexpectedly and pours the mines in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners claim that none of them complain about suffering from serious diseases... however, it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
In his 53 years, the Unainik, who considers his basket on his back, can load only 50 kilos in its 53s.
Each day, he and his colleagues are powering 15 tons of sulphur, which then three truckers take a steep road between the swings to the warehouse in Tamansari 18 kilometres away.
“I am not going to retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life,” states Unainik and opens up a wide mouth where several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, he is the eldest, thirty-year-old, also earning serrated.
Time flows, but the permanent poverty of one of the world's most difficult craftsmanship continues from generation to generation - craftsmanships that perform human mullies in Kah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singapore says they don't have children, careers, stress, and cost of living and education.
The population of Singapore needs growth
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the advertising on the mentol candy, but still - or maybe that's why - the video at the beginning of this year in Singapore has spread to YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rap that uses local precipitation types - we put the cylinder in the oven - as a mixture of birth rates in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to take advantage of the influence of music in order to enable people to fulfil their civil responsibility.
\"One is solely about the Internet matter, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things to expand perfumes with feromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, \"Why not do the most bloodful thing like rap composition to solve this problem?\"
1,2 children
Whoever doesn't take much light weight is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 annually to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for a child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in South Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, taking into account the dissipation of the population, is currently 1.2 of the child per woman.
The latter exceeded the birth rate of 2, which is considered to be the peace of recovery in 1976.
Why don't Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, Director of the Department of Marriage and the National Authority's Family, says it's because of better education - and a wider range of career opportunities -
In this way, people have a wider range of opportunities in terms of life objectives and priorities, not only weddings and family, - explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the withdrawal of marriage and childbirth.
While there was an attempt to drastically increase the arrival of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this caused disobedientity among the local population.
On some Singapore web pages, you can see uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Government of Singapore recorded its worst electoral outcome since the beginning of independence.
Following the elections, efforts have been made to address the problem through quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.
Unforeseeable consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health and immigration spending, some unexpected consequences have also occurred in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence real estate trade.
The City Development Office began to regulate the number of small flats known as “crabbics from the shoe” that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have a area of 46 square meters and have a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support the youth style and reflect developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, the CEO of the company EL Developers, claims that their “krabice from the shoe” are sold far faster than more houses.
They're more popular, and they're selling for days to weeks faster than houses with bigger space.
That's why our cash flow is much better -
However, he admits that the new standards set out more clear rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, the conversation with Singapore workers working in the financial district in the city suggests that they will not have a great effect.
“The people are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore many people postpone it,” says the young official.
- Let the others have children.
But it's important for me to rely on your own money and time,\" says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they are, in the same way, Singapore, who have the last word about setting up a family.
What private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal nature or a area of private life, which each has the right to protect against any interference.
What is privacy for a man under 16?
How does this definition apply in its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he's exposed to when he publishes issues on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Reporters from the elPeriodico have spoken five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be entirely their own - in person and as a “user name and password - if it was a social network.
“My biggest secret would not be published,” says Jorge, ten-year-old in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has the accounts for two years.
“They are very secretive secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world,” she says.
I'm taking nice pictures or pictures of us playing FB.
I'm also talking to my friends there.
I wouldn't share a photo that wouldn't be mine or a picture that would make someone laugh,\" he says.
This boy realizes it's wrong to publish obscenary photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter supporters.
Most of them are related.
There's also a mother who has a name and a password from one of his accounts.
“I started my Twitter account so I could express my opinions and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer me, I'm just putting them there, - I'm going to add.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or quickly communicating with friends,” he says.
Without weight, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown.
The 14-year case is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and admits that he doesn't know 20 people from his friends list.
“I am not afraid of it because we have something in common, such as music,” he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him on anything, or even asked him the address or the phone number.
“If they insist on me or demand me, I will simply remove them from my account,” she admits.
José applied to Ask after he read his Twitter recommendations.
This boy has no foreign experience with what is called cyberbullying today.
A friend on the social network was blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked him for money.
He never knew who he was, - confirmed.
The victim didn't report herself from José's account.
“Only the private regime activated.
Then it explains the series of steps, how to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of his friends in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
Of course I'd do it if someone were bothering me or I just wanted to.
Although I know it's cyberbullying, he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and graduate in the field of Education and Education, is responsible for the fact that children and adolescents in social networks are rightly oriented, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
He states that: ‘Internet has been created as a means to search for information, but when social networks have appeared, the rules of the game have changed.’
Marrielos Porras notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogue at Yale University and author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are just learning ourselves,\" he says.
It explains that it is a complex topic, “because we ask them to see what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and, on the contrary, at the age when they are not yet mature,” he explains.
Also, to be - as regards the surroundings - discreet, at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences - he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way to show children and adolescents what it is, asking questions that make them think.
“I tell them not to do anything, they don’t work,” he adds.
Also Marrielos Porras mentions some of the options: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like someone to publish your picture the way you published your friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
If you're referring to people in the photos of the party, have you asked these people permission?
And one more: They all need to know what you're doing?
The next point is that they realize that they must behave in the Internet as well as outside it.
It's the same rule.
“The man is governed by respect, moral and other principles and should be the same on social networks,” he says.
See you later.
Estardo Guardia, university professor, teacher at first-stage and educational counsellor explains that it is necessary for children to carefully read the social networking rules.
“If they understand every single population, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that the account can be set up on the Internet.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish, he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule - not to speak to strangers -
Summit South America ends and the Statement of Lima has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasure) held in Peru today, without the release from Lima, which was adopted and allegedly signed by seven present presidents.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to access the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of the Presidential Offices who set out at the beginning that the document will publish after the summit, said that it will later be published on the website of the Persian Government.
They also stated that the content was published by President Ollanta Humalog in several short press statements.
The reporters had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without sound, with a confidential session, audio transmission is replaced by
A small amount of information available to the journalists was provided by the press spokespersons of some of the governments who were present, but not by the Persian spokesperson.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participants with the presidents, which caused no call for hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Later, she sent the Persian Presidency's media office by e-mail with a statement from the summit, but it is only about the expression of President Humala and not the official document that the summit concluded.
Last October hosted Peru's third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Paises Árabes, ASPA) and was not originally promised Declaration from Lima, although the press was badly required.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Persian authorities sought to ensure the broadcast for all journalists but completely prevented the transmission of information.
Among other things, the Summit ended with the common obligation of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which deals with a dispute on the border between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice in Haag, which will begin to question both parties' defence speech during the regional meeting, which was launched by Lima against Santiag on Monday.
“We will examine and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court,” said President Humula, together with his chilian counterpart.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peace settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,” Piñer added and greeted President Humul with his hand with the flag of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be subject to the decisions of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, thus expressing the subjection to the judgments of the international court, which decided on the maritime borders of Nicorau, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely incorrect.
Summit was held without the participation of Brazil Presidents (Dilma Rousef), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur's organization in 2011 after the appeal of President Fernando Luga and the meeting did not take part.
Hostorial President Ollanta Humula was entrusted with the opening of early speeches and the end of the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document informing that 16 agreements were accepted and the activities were scheduled for 31 projects between South American countries, with investments worth $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Member States of UNASUR will take important steps towards the objectives of South American citizenship to extend their residence agreements to:
He informed that actions are supported to improve cooperation in combating civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of drugs and cheap internet in all parts of South America and to common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters,
When Europe is in the crisis, it is important to have economic consolidation ( Latin America) the winning nature, but it is intended to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future,” Humula added.
“We have decided to prefer a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different locations in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic links,” says the president of the Czech Republic.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its land’s strict axis from the coast to Brazil, and the other two related to a better connection with Ecuador, but did not show more detail.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the election process in this country will serve as its return to the Union of South American nations, from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain prosperous and peaceful, wholesome and good neighbouring relations.
In that sense, President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation at the regional meeting that he hopes that he will meet with his Iranian counterpart Daniel Ortego on Saturday in Mexico to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime border dispute doubted by Bogota.
“It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortego tomorrow ( Saturday),” said Santos.
“We will discuss all solutions, no exclusion or contract with Nicorau, which would require negotiations with this country,” he stressed.
“I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortego that we will be able to carry out the most civilized and possible form of action,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Niety will take place.
As part of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers initially met in order to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the area of defence.
The UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary chairman of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn European integration
The Ecuador president Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which the South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe:
Correa, who participated in the sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union in Lima, stated on TV Perú, that Europeans were killed for World War II, and in other conflicts, but are now practically one country -
In this sense, he advocated a project to create a South American citizenship that the Member States are supporting Unasur.
\"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still return areas that want to return to the past,\" he pointed out.
Among other things, the Ecuadorese President stated that he agreed to regroup the American Organisation (OAS) on condition that the influence of the Anglosian states will be reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on human rights will be taken into account.
“Those who are in the forehead will never commit to anything, and we South Americans will, on the contrary, sign everything.
It is inconceivable that the International Committee on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington,” said the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange in the opposition to political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray its principles and respected his “deep democratic values and human rights.”
He added that at that time, there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be given to a third country regardless of the ongoing process,
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice, which asked him to submit an interview in the Swedish territory for alleged sexual delith, while the Swedish legislation allows for an interview by a videoconference call that could take place from the Ecuadorese embassy in London,
Correa claimed that there is a risk that Assange’s physical and psychological health will be worsened.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had minor lung problems, but nothing serious,” said the Ecuadorian head of the state.
However, his physical and psychological condition will worsen because it is closed into a small space without the ability to move on fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health, - complete.
President Correa noted that the resolution of asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecvodor Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had taken place with London to resolve the incarnation of the founder WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but they have constantly held talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón runs a series of proceedings at various European instances,” he said.
He said that “if Great Britain gives up a pass tomorrow, all will end.”
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange's embassy in London or over Skype, as without the problem it enables there to be legislation and, as has been done in other cases, tomorrow will be the end of this problem,
Correa took advantage of this situation in order to present himself as the defender of freedom of the press, and made it clear that it was definitely not tolerated by the proportionality, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression.
The greatest enemies of free press are not us, submissive and disfellowshipping politicians, but bad journalists in the services of profit, assault and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy over the fact that even such journalists, or bankers, nor hegemonous countries, and neither the burjoaes control Ecuador - and that if he was elected again, he would continue to make changes in the right direction and direction.
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the decision expressed by Paraguay on the membership of the Unasur Union at least in its next elections and argued that the whole - must be firm and not tolerated by opportunism and pusism covered by legality - because, in fact, it destroyed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy -
In addition, the Ecuadorese President stated that he considered it perfectly appropriate to negotiate with Nicorau on the maritime borders between the two countries, at the time of the judgment of the International Court of Hague, which he decided to benefit Nikaragy.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
It's a problem between South American and Central American countries.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to assess the width to be overcome and to be able to go forward -
He also expressed the hope of settlement of the maritime border dispute in Peru and Chile in the same court and expressed the view that it would be right for Latin America to seek international instance if both countries considered to accept the judgment, however hard,
In view of the possibility of running in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to take place in order to take place in order for a third mandate, he noted that he saw this option - with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult -
Correa said that if he loses his election in February 2013, he will leave his public life.
“My personal concern has never been much, but such an unfair situation, such as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador, can only be corrected by political powers.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility,” he said.
“If I had won, it would be my last presidential period and then I would have left politics.
When we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I have already decided,” he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I spoke with Vice President Nicolás Madur, Vice President of Venezuela, who says President Chávez has gone to planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It is not a recidition in the state of the President’s health,” he explained.
Today, the head of the Ecuadorian State took part in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Union), which was completed with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
“It was as if lightning hit me,” he relates when he remembered the moment of truth that the doctor tried to “below down, but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from the family.
He decided to take his illness on his own bed and he started to inform himself about it, and with such an assumption that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most recent HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG) that came to in 1994 after several fearful diseases.
Fabrizio has been living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 22 years, which has been something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, little options of treatment and greater stigma.
At that time, even the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut wound -
That's when having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live with this syndrome fully.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their illness and lose when the virus caused the destruction of the organism and strengthened the immune system, and then they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, it is a great success that the length of life of a patient who starts with treatment in a timely and appropriate way is exactly the same as in healthy people, said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of HIV Units in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, saying that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectology and specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that the survival and life expectancy is dependent on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, and better those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells may live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
This simply means that the one diagnosed with HIV in 25 years may, according to these knowledge, live without problems until 75 years of age, explain the doctor’s interview.
It is appropriate to point out that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although mortality has decreased significantly over recent years and in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen significantly from 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the UN Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS) is also true that 60 percent of patients have been killed since the detection of AIDS.
Only in the State of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and until this May until this year 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirotics has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die of disease?
- I don't think the problem is in options for accessing treatment.
That's how I see it. This is how it happens at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted the drug supplies, and the problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or at the late stage of the disease,
It adds a convincing indication: “The nine of the ten patients come when some associated infections are manifested. The only thing that needs to be done so that we can influence more overall mortality is to be diagnosed earlier, and therefore, it is necessary to offer tests at large to identify the diseases of all those who request them.
In his design he matches specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio who came to do tests in a private laboratory just because he did it to his friend, and despite his low age, he had already missed AIDS disease and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer disease which is one of the usual complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
\"If I'm to die, I'd rather go out three times a week,\" they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medicine -
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, travel, I lead active sex life, but responsible, I look out for myself and the other person,\" says Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid today in World AIDS day.
If they've been risking, let them know if they're positive, it's better, and if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible.
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Desktop condoms
Among health programmes and ordinary citizens there is a great gap, said Ricardo Salazar, the Guadalajar journalist, who learns information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are concerned with this task, the distribution of condoms has actually increased before they gave us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who have no access to condoms,” he said.
There are teenagers among the most vulnerable to new diseases.
“What you want” is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school advisers, employees of pharmacy and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, says reporter.
He designed this ineffective distribution to change, so the condoms are not just pulty, but the hundred be found in donors in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
- It's not the promotion of promiscuity.
It's not even about paying them a beer and a motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree with the distribution of condoms in his district.
The best thing to do is to make condoms available to those who already lead sex life,\" he noted.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
13 435 cases of AIDS (12 158 cases and 1 317 HIV cases) have been reported.
This condition means the fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the disease takes place in a sexual way, 6% of the blood path y 2% persistently.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who don't know about the disease in one registered case.
The judgment approved by the appeal of the United States Court of First Instance, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of Group Vitro, established by the Mexiku bankruptcy, calls for any national branch undertaking in the neighbouring country and the compatibility problem.
It appears, therefore, that restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws, in the country of stripes and stars, do not apply despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment delivered on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Hal at the audition court for North Texas leaves Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the second bank of the el Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican producer of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States with a appeal against three irregularities.
Initially, it must be said that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to follow the US's insolvency law, the Board of Appeal of the Fifth District, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy in Mexico.
First of all, this would point to the absence of international procedural cooperation in the case of the insolence of transnational enterprises.
In essence, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law, which sets out the arbitration organisation of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without voting the branches of the internal corporate structure, when the parent’s debt to the branches of Vitro is recognised, the required majority would not be reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility of Mexican law makes sense.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, for whose intra-house debts the Federal Training Institute has ruined.
In addition, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branch, creditors - who stood against Vitro in a court in the United States, i.e. the funds of the fund - such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convertgencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach most.
The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This statement of appeal is not considered in question.
From another angle of view, Vitro's court is guilty of the difficult situation facing since 2008 - under the background of a serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company Gonzáleze Sada will appeal to a new assessment directly in the appealing court, so that the assessment is fully involved, that is, in the participation of five judges, because only three have originally voted.
If it does not succeed here, it will require the revision of the higher instance process as a remedy, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is serious that the court has forgotten a document sent to the Mexican Government as an act of amicus curiae, which describes the Vitro procedure in detail within the framework of the Constitutional Law and in which it points out that the company has eased itself by attaching itself to agreements signed by the two countries in order to confront that law with Chapter 15 of the United States' Civil Aviation Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, this is the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the State.
Overall evaluation
Without notice, there were several months of criminal notification of the Mexican Aviation Department against the former owner of the Gaston Azcárg Andrad, who was ordered from fraud, and according to the expert organisation of the pilots, the vessel has already been leaked.
An instance at the head of Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed an action against the National Banking Commission and a committee for securities, accused of obstruction in achieving justice.
According to the Authority, the audit authority has systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this trader, in which it selected from F/589 Fideicos on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company 198 million pesos.
The funds were probably directed towards buying the shares of Professional hotel administration (Administradora Professional de Hotels).
As known, Azcáraga Andrade is the major shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart's siege
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens, who approved the establishment of an association, met on the weekend to prevent the opening of Chinese Dragon Martu in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with products from large walls - focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would in the bottom of would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
She has previously managed to unite the governors of the South-East Zone to stand against the monumental area which would in part present a protected area, which forms the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the ACTA document
The request of the Senate that the government did not take into account and which required an explanation under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador signed a trade agreement against counterfeiting under the English shortfall of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propid Industrial), has lost its news.
As is known, it has happened in spite of the fact that the Senate itself has excluded the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debts and not influence these short-terms, Homex has put the developer company on the market investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identicals to offer interest payments every 28 days.
Competival is born
The association of leading companies in information technology such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet was born by a company with a sales name Competival, which will aim at the market of software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business is going to exceed 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector-Hetin - Reyes: “The basketball was my life--
The basketball world's Hector-Hetin-Reyes was with this spa sport for more than 60 years, and it was the world's process.
Few people in Puerto Rico have such many memories of the history of local basketball, such as Hétor-Hetin-Reyes.
Reyes was burned into this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, the national basketball league player of BSN, the owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league or the President of the Portoric basketball Federation.
“I held a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including a few at the same time as when I was President of the National League of BSN, the general of the national team and the President of the Federation,” Reyes remembered when he visited the reporters of Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
-Basketbal was my life -
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and memorial objects from his long career, testifying.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest motive from all the guards that resemble his actions in the fate of Vaqueros for the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
“It was my best years, I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity with the Vaqueros team since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
At that time, the team took over, Cuco, Ortiz, who was an excellent leader, said Reyes.
“I remember that Gene Bartow, who was a coach here earlier, and that time he worked at the Alabama University in Birmingham, said:“I have a grown-up two-meter player for you.
You want him--
And that was the beginning of Monica, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me with Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy would bring Bayamon the victory at the championship, Gausse would then contribute to the next--
The championship, when Gausse was playing for the Vaqueros team, enjoyed only the distance, because in 1988 he was already acting as president of the basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to spend his duties and enjoy Mincy's location in the National Team.
I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then there came the 1990 World Cup, where we ended the fourth quarter, but we were supposed to have a bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throwing,” Reyes said.
Is the man from the 1990 World Championship the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who defeated Dream Team in Olympiad in 2004.
But my favorite was a national team in the Panamer Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and blew up the U.S. man, which was quite similar to the one that blew our bronze at the World Cup.
This manhood had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and “Piculina” (Ortiz), but also there were youths (Javier), Toñito, Colón and James Carter, León brothers (France and Edgar) and Mario-Quiote, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A man who may not have had the perfect composition, but could win the gold medal and bring great joy was a man from the Olympic qualifier in 1995 in Argentina Neuquén.
With players on the soupist, like they were, Canito, Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitner, who replaced players excluded because of the fight in the Paneric games in Mar de Plata, we have won gold despite all predictions.
How was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was without any doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico has reached this level of results such as Piculin.
Not to mention his actions in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best portoric coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which belongs to Julio Toro, Floren Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work very much from young people.
Which of your success in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national manhood in 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990 ’ s, the National League of BSN had in one season up to 17 gentlemen.
What did you not find to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for trainers, judges' assistants and referees.
Nice to meet you.
What are you doing now?
I'm listening to music, watching YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoying grandchildren, and sometimes going to basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21st, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was famous for the main roles of John Ross Ewing, known as ‘J.R., in television series Dallas, in which he became a man who was careless and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the precious oil magnet J.R. Ewinga on television series Dallas became a symbol of lactose in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official notification of the family that the Association Press agency provided to Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer.
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he preferred,” his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
“Linda Gray, who was his wife’s representative in the original and new series, was with Hagman when he died at the Dalla Hospital,” said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all whom he knew.
\"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full,” said Linda Gray in the announcement.
The Hagmans diagnosed liver circulation in 1992, and he admitted that he drank many years.
In 1995, he was found on his liver, and Hagman was subjected to transplantation.
The summer before the television series, Dallas became Hagman on TV as a decent guy in a decommissioned comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played Captain Tony Nelson's figure, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (woman) played by Barbara Eden and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedys that were sent only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in films included roles that were well accepted with the critic: The Group, Harry and Tonto and the Primary Colors.
But it was after Hangman's master performance in the form of incredibly repulsive J.R., who led him to the starboard.
The Dramatic series of CBS stations on the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was sent from April 1978 to May 1991.
Propagation slogan -Who shot Jajara - who was supposed to raise expectations about the work of full emotions, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, has not only caused a huge number of speculators worldwide, but also risking millions of dollars in rate offices.
This also helped to achieve a record of ratings.
The November 1980, in which the answer was revealed, followed on average 41 million TV viewers. Dallas thus became the second most fun show of history after the end of the MASH broadcast in 1983, followed by 50 million viewers.
At J.R., his brother-in-law Kristin was fired (which Mary Crosby played).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and then threatened to mark her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack her.
Hagman played Ewinga, an insatiable greed with a charizmatic smile: a brilliant businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) who was an alcoholic to be put into treatment.
“I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone” said Hagman in 1988.
There should be: ‘This is the honorary citizen of J.R. Ewing.
This is all he didn't get.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered on Friday at Hagman as someone who was “great on canvas and outside.”
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky to know him and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast TNT station a few months ago with great success.
“It has been finished shooting five parts of the second series and the sixth series has just begun,” informed the television station.
Indirectly after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or from TNT Station about how the series would continue.
The family of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of actresses and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classic works such as the musicians of South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she bore Larry in 1931 whose father was her husband, Ben Hagman's lawyer.
At the beginning of the 1950s Larry tried the happiness of theatre scenes in New York and then served in England in 1952 to 1956 at the air force.
There he met the young Swedish designer May Axelsson, who married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu California, where there are many celebrities.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolulate True) Tales about My Life.
\"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt anyone or hurt him,\" said Prensa Association.
After a liver transplant he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital where he helped combat patients.
“I give them courage, I meet with them when they go to surgery and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of “be careful, it will be a little uncomfortable, but you will be healthy“
He was also active in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
It begins with a course that examines the end of the world -
Every week students examine apocalypse topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would make a course about the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible appeal: the end of the long-term number--the May Calendar to come on December 21st, many people were caught as proof that the end of the world is coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what he was waiting for in several months: the Catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call the “long Armageddon“ and the growing conflict to which Israel is enslaved, a place where, according to the theoretical Christians of the end of the world, Apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t realize that this was going to be the most apocalypse semester that he had ever been,” Charmé told the students of Rutgers University this week in Camden, New Jersey.
When you take care of what's going on in the world today, as if we've had 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means good to apocalypse.
And that is not the only professor who offers courses about the end of the world - in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple is organized by a specialist assistant Barry Vacker course - Media, culture and end of the world -
Every week students examine apocalypse topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
“We can see why these thoughts are expanding over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material goes into the hands of terrorists, war can go off.
This month students analyze films with apocalypse topics and explore how they differ from real life examples.
“I tried to inform students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, expert assistant of art history and anthropology to organize a course with simple name End of the world.
“We don’t join -2012 - because we always count on the possibility of organising the course again if the world does not end,” said Restall.
Despite the “hazardous destruction, students must study, develop projects and conduct final tests.
On Penn State, the final exam will be held in June of Apocalypse, which does not give students a choice other than working until the end of the world, said Restal.
The courses have become quite popular.
“It spread within two hours,” said Restal about his course for students with high averages, which came in 35.
Week and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail to see if there was any more room.
Students themselves make sure the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Rutgers University of Camden 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
So the apocalypse, worldly or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology student and nursery, said he saw all the apocalypse films.
“I have never heard of an hour in which it might be taught,” he said.
- I'm enjoying it.
But no questionable student, let alone professor, said he believed at the end of December 21st.
“Our first project was discussed by the Mayan predictions and, in a certain way, we will bring it back,” said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student at Temple University of West Chester.
“Mayans have never foretold the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar,” he said.
But he added that there was apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which set back a few centuries, which people reacted to changes in their surroundings with forecasts of the end of the world.
The expansion of these speculations caused the internet.
-Jinde didn't think about it, - he said.
It happens in an absolute majority in English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who this year lectured on the Philippines, asks if he knew there was a course about the “end of the world” that he responded quickly.
“Filipina does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote and suggested an exception to the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
During the years, he noted that the last days of the judgment were spoken of, and he said that if nothing was done on 21 December, people would start to think immediately about the next date - or philosophy that 21st December was the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world would disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several said that they intended to go to the end of the world.
I'll call some friends to laugh at each other, explain the 20 - year - old Samir Ford communication student.
