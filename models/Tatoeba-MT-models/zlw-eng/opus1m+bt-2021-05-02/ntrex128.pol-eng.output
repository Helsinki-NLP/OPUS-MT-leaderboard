Members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to be called muppets
Some of the members of the National Assembly have been consulted. This is the result of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, in short MWP).
The idea was made in connection with plans to change the assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of the cinema.
One of the parliamentarians of the Labour Party expressed his concerns about his group, saying that the new name was timid with the Welsh words “twp” and “pwp”
For readers outside Wales, the word “twp” means a fool, and the word “pwp” is leaving.
One of Plaid Cymru's politicians stated that his group was “not satisfied,” he proposed and presented other solutions.
However, a member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was “open” to a change of name. He pointed out that the words “MWP” are very close to the word “muppet”,
In this case, the letter ‘in’ is referred to in the same way as the letter ‘in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
As part of the assembly, the committee currently working on the draft amending act took the following position: “The natural final decision on the future title of the assembly members will be their own.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal. The debate at the Welsh Parliament gained broad support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the assembly members to the ‘Wylogue of the Welsh Parliament - the WMP in English, although the \"MWP - has enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
The members of the assembly propose alternative solutions. The difficulty of reaching consensus is the loss for Elin Jones, the chair of the assembly, which should present the draft law within the next few weeks.
The Reform Act will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the principle of decommitment of members and the structure of the comitology system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the law.
The Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the country name
In the coming Sunday, the voter will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The universal vote is intended to help to encourage a dispute with a neighbouring Greek, which is called Macedonia for decades.
The Government in Athens has long been claiming that their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed the attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
\"orge Ivanow, President of Macedonia and the opponent of the referendum on the modification of the name, said he disregarded the results of the vote.
However, the supporters of the plebicity, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to allow you to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in the New York church of St. Marcin will be silent in connection with the problems of the St. Harlem’s tragic churches.
“The older people I talk to say that once upon each corner there was a bar and church,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There is no sign of them, ” he said.
As he says, the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“Acccommodating people in a different way, ” he noted.
“Bares have ceased to be a place of regular meetings between members of the community,
However, in the case of churches he is concerned that the assets are not sufficient for as long as they consider decision-making persons, and that “at the beginning or later they will be at the starting point,” he says.
He added that the churches could be replaced with apartment owners inhabited by people who would not support other surrounding temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of those who buy an apartment in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will be members of these parishes.
Both churches were built by the assembly of white faithful ones before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the churches of St. Marcin joined the community ten later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
The local assembly of African-Americans then took over property rights to the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by the assembly under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against salesmen from the 125th Street (the main trade street in Harlem) against the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The 1939 fire greatly damaged the building, but the parishion of John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and order the construction of the bell band.
The Reverend David Johnson, John Howard Johnson's son and his successor in St. Marcin's church, proudly called the new Cardinal “the sounds of the poor.
The expert in the bells in July described them differently as: “the cultural treasure, and the “unreplaced historical instrument”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carylion in the world supported by black music. This artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to Riverside Church, where he waited for him a bigger band.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin's church didn't replace him.
In recent months, in the Church of St. Marcin there have been a number of complicated events involving architects and performers. Some of them have brought the secular leaders of the church, and some have been the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish management board (a parish management body composed of candle leaders) led to the diocese of its concerns, claiming that “it wanted to shift the costs of advice, although the council did not take part in hiring architects and contractors sent to the place.
Some parishian complains also about lack of transparency on the diocese side.
Rekin hurt a 13-year-old in search of lobsters in California.
The authorities said that last Saturday the shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old in search of lobsters in California, and the event happened on the first day of the season on lobster.
The attack took place just before 7am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that in Saturday morning for about half an hour he dived with his friends when he heard a cry for help.
As Hammel said, at first he felt that the boy was excited to catch the lobster. But soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten.
After reaching the scene of Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely broken skin in the area of the collar.
“I began yelling at everyone to escape from the water: “In the water there is shark!”“ Hammel added.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to the hospital of the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego.
The species shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been spotted several weeks earlier. However, it was recognised that it was not a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper tug.
In order to investigate and for safety reasons, the authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad until Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noticed that there are over 135 species of sharks living in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's store network plans to expand its business on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws gloves to shops such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, bringing cosmetic departments into their supermarkets, which apply to freight houses, as well as specially trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to develop despite the declines in the fashion and household products, 11 online stores will appear higher racks with cosmetic products. If the initiatives are successful next year, they will be extended to the next points.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's network will double the number of cosmetic products and offer even 3 thousand articles. In the range for the first time, goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold articles of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known, though from Boots shops.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to freshen its offer of products to Boutique makeup. From now on, most articles will be friendly to vegans, which increasingly require younger customers.
In addition, the seller perfum Fragrance Shop will create test points at two supermarkets of Sainsbury's. The first opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and the second one will be built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The wide variety of online sales and daily shopping of small amounts of food in local shops makes supermarkets more encouraging customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points will increasingly resemble goods houses, because the network is trying to fight discounts, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's placed the Argos Network Points in hundreds of shops and introduced a number of Habitat Network Points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing the sale of food products and increasing the profitability of the investment.
The previous attempt to organize sections of cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was completed following a conflict of income sharing from supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduced a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacy to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for a sum of £ 125 million three years ago.
According to the reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by introducing an extended offer of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four web shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have developed the appearance and nature of the cosmetics department to improve customer awareness.
We have invested in special training for coworkers to help consumers when they buy.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to pay attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question previous ways of shopping.
Peter Jones “worried, once Holly Willoughby retired from a contract of EUR 11 million
Peter Jones, a star of Dragons' Day TV program, was “worse,” when he found out that Holly Willoughby was planning to withdraw from the $111 million Lifestyle brand to focus on a newly-connected collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand belonging to the Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
The urgent decision to leave a well-perpetrated Lifestyle brand and to focus on the newly-connected collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV taken by Holly Willoughby upset Peter Jones, Dragons' Day Star.

The company was compared earlier to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop. It was also expected to double the property of Holly Willoughby estimated at £11 million.
After the decision to leave Truly for 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram Peter Jones left the Great Britain, going to one of his summer homes.
The source says: “Marka Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She had a future with her, and she wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the activities completely surprised all involved persons.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow warehouse, the goods are ready for sale.
Experts believe that the resignation of this Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK can cost millions of pounds due to significant investment in products, including articles from candles to clothing and household articles, and will further delay the entry into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years held close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded Truly in 2016, and Peter Jones joined them in March as President.
The couple spent their holidays together, and Jones included 40% of the share in the production of a TV company owned by Dana Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is supposed to be a M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity in ITV Station.
The source close to Peter Jones last night said: “We will not comment on his business affairs.
A difficult conversation, “and then we fell in love with each other.
The president was joking about the media criticism made by the comments that some considered to be “an unfounding state husband, as well as a positive relationship with North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a funny voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
‘I have not given up anything;
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trumpa a big step towards the denucleration of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear weapons are delayed.
After more than three months from the Singapore June summit, the head of the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that he did not see “a logical response from the United States to the early operation of North Korea to armedize.
He noticed that instead, the United States is maintaining sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are fine with North Korea, ” he said.
\"We've been putting war on North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we maintain great relations -
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Unem brought positive results: leading to the end of rocket trials, helped release the hostages and return to the remaining American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim Dzong Un.
“It’s easy to behave after the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium we would have 200 people here,” said Trump, showing the crowd gathered right in front of us.
The tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have saved up one of the islands by killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok foreign NGOs, it was said that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head of more than 10% of Lombok's inhabitants, the authorities have not announced a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up the activities of international aid.
“In many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support. So the situation is difficult,” said Selina Summung.
Although the Save the Children are preparing to travel to the Indonesian town of Palu, it is not so far sure that international staff can operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in the Palu to see if aid from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared for dealing with the forces of nature.
Although in Aceh Province, the tsunami shelters were built, they are rare for the rest of the shoreline.
The lack of siren warning against the tsunami in the Palu, despite the release of warnings, probably had an impact on the number of deaths.
Even in the most favourable conditions of travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
The resin cages are even more difficult to provide logistics.
A hospital ship stationed on Lombok island is heading for help from the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the target.
President Joko Widodo made improvements in Indonesia's infrastructure the main point of his campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railway lines.
However, in view of the future elections, the President’s administration is faced with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure due to the continuing tensions in the country on the religious basis. The members representing the majority of Muslim communities accepted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of inhabitants lost their roof over their heads as a result of a fight between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, arches, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.

Cromwell's monument to the British parliament’s last victim in the dispute of “recasting history“
The removal of the monument would bring justice for resembling the actions of the Taliban to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Ukrainian followers.
However, the Cromwell Society presented Jeremy Crick’s proposal as “a psycho - and “the attempt to write history again -
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute of Oliver Cromwell’s character was a matter of time before the Westminster Palace.
The images of action during the English civil war were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps his forefather Thomas had previously decided to punish not Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell to the monument shows the opinion of this policy in the 19th century and that for many people it is worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview for The Sunday Telegraph: “For many Cromwell’s people he was perceived, perhaps more often in the 19th century than today, behind the defense of Parliament against external pressures.
The assessment, as appropriate, is subject to a continuous historical debate.
It is important, however, that the conflict of the mid-19th century has developed a further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognised form of identify one of the parties to division.
His achievements as Lord of the Protector also deserve a feast and commemoration.

More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh auditions
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations moving on Thursday's hearing of a candidate for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment who took place in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to stop the programmes regularly asked to inform them of the sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation of the prosecution.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate's court committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been pushing her up in a state of impurity and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said, however, that it was foretold that this was not the case.
It is possible that the fifth number of TVs was even greater than those given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company calculated the average number of CBS televisers, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures have been available yet.
In addition, Nielsen tends to be difficult to measure visibility among people in workplaces.
The number given is similar to the performance of the American football cup games or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to the reports, Nielsen Station Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest visibility.
In the second place there was an ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.44 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interested in the topic remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure of Friday's events.
In the morning, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of that moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. He yells at the demonstrators who hindered him from entering the elevators on the way to the hearing of the committee of justice.
Flake with his head off for a few minutes listened to the undisputed opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by CNN.
“I'm standing here in front of you and I'm asking.
Do you think he tells the nation the truth?
You have the strength in the face of so many women’s indignation, and you have heard from the demonstrative woman.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the committee.
Later, TV stations continued to transdate events pending the vote on the transfer of Kavanaugh's nominations before the whole Senate.
Flake said that it would only be over the nomination if he knew the FBI was going to investigate charges in the coming week, which led to the minority of Democrats.
Flake got a part of the conversation with her friend, Senator Chris Coons, from the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after he met Chris Coons and some other senators.
Flake's choice was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigating.
President Trump initiated the FBI's investigation on charges sent to Brett Kavanaugh.

On Friday night, a group of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent the demonstration of police support.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change in the route was made.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician, together with his wife involved in separatist prosthetists, said that there is no hope of the independence of Catalania.
“ Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were delighted that they could vote, but now we're stuck with no exit,\" he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the Catalan Association have difficulties continuing action. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or await the process in connection with the role played in the referendum and later to announce independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone supporting the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute are going to boost the conflict.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced the desire to launch in the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
In its elections to the European Parliament, it is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.

Mengi Gate provides the Livingstone winner over Rangers 1:0
The first gol of Dolly Mengi for Livingston brought the victory team
Since this season, the Livingston Club has been working on the Rangers' backdrops, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 matches as a team coach from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's bracelet turned out to be a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in a table taken together with Hibernian.
The team under the direction of Gerrard remains this season without victory at the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will meet with the leader of Hearts, who loses eight points.
Previously, on Thursday, the Rangers will host a Rapid Vienna team in the EUFA League game.
Livingston extended the series of victory in his division to six matches. Coach Holt did not experience failures since he replaced Kenny Miler in his position last month.
Livingston missed a few occasions against undisposed opponents.
The team run by Holt should have taken place much earlier, as the team's game has caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First Scott Robinson went through the defense and fired a goallight, but he couldn't shoot a goal, and then Alan Lithgow didn't go after Craig Halket's head took over.
The hosts allowed Rangers to play closer goals, knowing that they could threaten rivals during constant parts of the game.
And that's how the decisive gate fell.
After giving up the Rangers, a free team of Livingston found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation Menga, which won the goal from the center of the criminal field.
At this stage, Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't overexplore the defense of the economy and did not cause more problems to the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's test was chosen by the Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to reach the gate light from another permanent portion of the defendant for Livingston.
Rangers continued attacks in Livingston's criminal field, but they couldn't take advantage of the situation.
‘Fenenomenal - Livingstone performance - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from returning to extravagant. However, Holta should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
He's got a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a highly organized defense, but Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrail a very careful match.
Rangers had no intention of fighting.
Even though there are great moments under Gerrard's lead, they didn't keep their standards in the game.
In their game there seemed to be something missing: only once it was possible to break through the defense of the economy. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to the visit of Erdogan in Cologne
During Saturday’s breakfast in Berlin (29 September), Turkey’s leaders and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to President Erdogan in Germany, with a view to improving the relationship between allies from NATO.
The disputes have led to differences in matters such as human rights, freedom of press and accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After a meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
In this city there are the largest number of Turks outside of their country.
As the police filed, for security reasons 25-thousand crowds gathered outside the temple, but the President's followers gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, including many Kurds, have also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey's policy and decision of the German government to adopt its policy in the country.
On the contrary, protests reflect the division of the policy visited by the hero by some of the Turks living in Germany and considered to be autocracy by others.

Trump stated that Kavanaugh had “a experience of anger and anger - Democratic Party in the course of the nomination process.

Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia.
As the authorities submitted on Saturday, at least 384 people died, many of which were taken by high waves spreading to beaches, following a strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in the Palu hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival city. About the dusk on the shore hit the waves reaching even 6 meters high, running many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When there was a threat yesterday, those who were staying on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purwo, a spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster agency BNPD.
“Tsunami attacked everything on its way, running cars, clones and houses,” said Nugroho. Then he added that before reaching the shore line, the element moved to sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them saved themselves with a tree climber and managed to survive.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in the Palu.
On the air photos published by the natural disaster agency you can see many damaged houses and shops, damaged and hit bridges and balls surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city visited secondary shocks.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in the area of 2.4 million people.
According to the statements of the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPT), energy released by an extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times higher than the energy of the nuclear bomb cast on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement states that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long narrow bay, could have been associated with the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
Then he added that the body of the victim was found under the hit buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 were considered to be missing.

According to Nugro’s communication, “has been completely paralysed, therefore, there are no reports from the province of Donggala.
“You can read over 300 thousand people there in the Red Cross statement. It has also been added that employees and volunteers of organizations will go to the site affected by the disaster.
“Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may result in a significant deterioration,” says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism due to the lack of information on the tsunami hit in the Palu. However, the authorities stated that the waves came right after the warning.
On an amateur recording made available in social media, you see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn about the coming tsunami of the person on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall crashed on the shore, running buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami have caused significant lack of electricity supply, preventing communication within the Palu. This in turn has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the military authorities, the sending of transport planes with the help of the Jakarts and other cities has begun, but evacuated people still need food and other essential articles of the first need.
Airport located in the city was opened only for transport with humanitarian aid. Airport will remain open until October.

While a part of the group slowly begins with assistance, criticisms have appeared that workers from foreign humanitarian organisations with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to the Palu.
According to the Indonesian law, the adoption of funding, resources and staff from abroad can only begin after the notification of the place of disaster by the national disaster.
It hasn't been done yet.
\" Officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster,\" said the spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start taking international assistance. However, this has not yet happened,” he said.

“I am therefore you, I am us, it is about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person, and now I am Ye, reflecting all our good, bad and confused qualities.

The President of Mexico's electricity Andrés Manuel López Orador commits not to use troops against civilians
In the early 50th anniversary of the bloody crowd of students, the president of Mexico's electricity Andrés Manuel López Orador (AMLO) committed never to use the troops against civilians.
On Saturday at the Tzech Kultur López Orador Square, he promised “not to use the army to repress the Mexican nation.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire at a place of fire towards peaceful demonstrations, killing even 300 people. The event occurred at a time when left student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Orador promised to support young people of Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for educational pride for young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee says, the investor and expert of artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies, along with the increase in China's activity in this area, the United States should double spending on SI research.
The comments made are related to announcements on artificial intelligence published by different US government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
However, last year China has presented their plan to be the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
\"At first, we need to double the SI research budget: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,\" said Kai-Fu Lee.
In this week's interview, the CNB also said that sub-warning of funds could twice increase the chances of making another breakthrough in the U.S. artificial intelligence area.
Lee, whose book entitled “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, is the president of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most significant companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980 ’ s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University for the creation of an SI system that defeated the best American player in Othello. He then held management position in Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognised the success of previous technology initiatives by the US Government, e.g. organised by the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the deadline for the next edition of the struggle, because he believes it will help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to try hard to get government grants.
“This is not China that receives the best academic representatives, but corporations,” said Lee.
For several years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to develop the SI.
“I believe that those who have received a doctor’s scientific degree who are artificial intelligence should be automatically granted a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
As Lee observes, the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the American National Foundation for Science and other government organisations which grant funds to US scientists. However, the quality of academic activities in China is lower.
In the previous period of this year, the Department of Defence of the United States set up a combined centre for artificial intelligence (Joint Arts Intelligence Center), which will engage in the work of partners in the world of industry and science.
This month, DARPA also informed about the 2 billion USD to an initiative called AI Next.
The National Foundation of Science currently invests over USD 100 billion per year in research into the SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to set up a national committee on the security of artificial intelligence for months has not taken a step forward.
The Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing their country name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in the referendum on changing their country name to the North Republic of Macedonia. This move would allow a few decades of dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposal, but the nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority residing in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said that he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts about whether the attendance would reach a minimum level of 50% required to recognise the referendum as binding.
The following question was put in the referendum: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following an agreement with Greece?
The advocates of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia - one of the countries resulting from the fall of Yugoslavia - to organisations such as the European Union and NATO.
\"I voted for the future of my country so that young people of Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with all greater security,\" said Otýra Georgia of Skopje.
While the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians declared that it would respect the results of the vote.
The amendment of the name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament's members.
The State electoral committee has informed that no unusual events have been recorded within 13 hours.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections. At that time, 66% of the entitled persons gave the vote.
“I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Tanewski, the voters of Skopje, 62 years old.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaew, his wife, Zorica and Duszko, gave their voice to the referendum on changing the country's name to open the path to NATO and European Union membership.
Prior to the Parliament building in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set the chairs before the tents spread by the boycotting referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU membership, but we want to join these organisations with our head, not the back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can address other countries such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Sales integration.
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, with more than 20% unemployment rates.
\"I believe that the vast majority will speak for a change in the name in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO\", said Zaew after giving their vote.
He stated that voting “yes” was “the confirmation of our future.
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared a willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required attendance.
According to another survey carried out by the Macedonian TV TV on Sunday's referendum, it plans to vote 57% of respondents.
70% of the surveyed claimed that after the change of name.
In order to succeed, the attendance must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow in the policy of the West Government since the taking of power in May last year.
See Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats all of Brighton's defense and gets a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent to their home defense of Brighton in Saturday's final 2:0 match for Manchester City. The goal was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester (English).
The gate taken by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with the application in the middle of the field to the Argentinian attacker.
The Piller ran through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among four contestants of Brighton.
First, he played one of them, and then crossped the others, and found himself on the edge of Brighton's penalty field.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English attacker immediately gave the ball back to Aguire in a criminal field who defeated the Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the gate.
“Aguero is struggling with the trauma of his feet,” said Coach Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
“We talked about the possibility of losing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have won the gate at that time.
However, Sterling assured the blue first running in the Premier League due to this.
The bracelet we're talking about fell in the 29th coin.
In the action of this Aguero, he got a ball deep into the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful pass along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move on to a long pole.
Manchester City's attacker sent the ball to the grid just before it went to the cars.
Manchester City will meet Hoffenheim in the EUFA Champions League on Tuesday 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil his chances of winning the Rockies
After losing his chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer he did not have to appear in the first composition.
However, the loving Scherzer competition hopes to be in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies if only the Rockies maintain their chances of performing in the playoff phase. Currently, the team has one victory more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against the Nationals score 5:2.
“Without playing «o nothing», at least we will go to the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting?
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter to a Sunday meeting, but the team is leaning towards displaying Scherzer in the first composition.
This would be the thirty-fourth show of Scherzer in the first composition.
The right handkerchief of the Washington team reports the results of 18-7 and the ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the practors and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trumpa in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination for Brett Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the Republican attendance in half of the election presidency.
“In November, we put all achievements to the table.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided by five weeks.
Although I don’t start, I’m staying very active. I’m holding our fine candidates’ weapons”, he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We can see their own actions.
They're determined to take all possible means of power.
They do not care who they hurt and who they need to hurt to gain authority and control.
As he said, Democrats carry out the mission of “resisting resistance and hampering activities, ”
“It was very good to see it in the last four days,” he said, calling it the Democrats “bad, wicked, unpleasant, unrighteous, and unrighteous. ”
The president referred to the Senate Court committee, calling on the name and name of the American senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, which met with a loud awakening from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
«Uh, am I listening?
No... it means... no». Her body language was fatal. It was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen.
The Working Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to people expressing their own opinions
When the Momentum activists voted in my party for giving me nakedness, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of members of the Labour Party, which has been recently said that they are not welcome, and all because of expressing their own opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with a similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for a nagany was based on the difference between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As for the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
On Friday’s announcement of the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting from Nottingham East, it was possible to read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.
For eight years I have served as a member of the Labour Party most of the afternoon's meetings of the General Committee, that's what it looked like.
Unfortunately, many meetings now go differently. A long time ago they have forgotten the promise of “the more sound and milder - politics, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no different view in the Labour Party. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the management of the party.
It began soon after Jeremy Corbyn's chair was taken over. The colleagues, in which I thought we had similar views, began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not agree with before, and they concerned issues such as national security or the EU Single Market.
After each public speech, regardless of the content, I meet in social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemnation of centralism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have at my address are rather political.
I admire professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the order of the day with insulting others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With each request “the existence of distrust,” and every change in the rules of choice, the view of the party is narrowed.
In the last two years, I have been once again suggested that I should not go away and be silent about certain things.
But that's not why I took care of politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of Margaret Thatcher, which led to the breakup of my school class, I try to take care of better quality of public services for those in need, both as local councillor and Minister.
I've never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew the differences between the parties' authorities.
The people who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the president of the labiracy in view of the approaching Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threats to the withdrawal of nominations or the alleged political goals will discourage me to act according to my convictions and the best interests of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 - Unending Ayr
However, there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved victory in this extremely interesting Scottish extralig game.
The team was first in the table and remains the only unrealized team.
At the end, this outstanding defense and better use of opportunity led the host to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his caregivers.
“Today games have been a challenge for us, but we are still inconceivable, so I am pleased,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose’s team said: “It is best to pay respect to Ayr’s players.
Ayr went on to lead in the 14th minute following Grant Anderson's position and increased Frazier Clima. However, a yellow card for Rory Hughes's school, who came to the team from the Glassgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to match the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after the unused opportunity to increase.
Climo increased the course of the Ayr following the execution of the penalty shot just before the first half ended. He first gained a position and then used a chance to increase, obtaining a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started off the second half, and Patrick Anderson's location increased by Baggota reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer stopover of the game due to the serious injury of Ruarith Knotta. An expert was removed from the foot field. After the resumption of Ayr, he increased running after Stafford McDowall and increasing Clima.
In the subsequent order of the duties of Captain Ayr Blair Macherson, he received a yellow card. Melrose again used its number: the assumption with the unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin has reduced its conduct.
The hosts took over the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for defeating Clima without a ball. MacPherson gained a position on the back of the coming defense.
Climo used a chance to increase, and then again he managed to increase the score just after the resumption of the game, when Kyle Rowe caught the shot from the penalty line and allowed Greg Henry's wing to win the fifth position for the economy.
The Still Game Star begins its career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, a star of Still Game series, seems to be starting a business in the gastronomy industry. It has recently been discovered that he has been the director of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor was involved in the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular number of BBC stations. He is performing and co-creates a series together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
Duet announced that the coming nineth season would be the last in the history of the series.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The Actor refused to comment on this subject, although the Informant Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in “the growing gastronomy industry in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us: free of access to the Bolivia Sea hope that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean.
Marines patrol the area of the La Paz Navy base.
There are blue flags from public buildings.
The following motto is seen in Lake Titicaca's Navy ports: “The sea is ours under the law.
His recovery is our duty.
In the lack of access to the Bolivia Sea, the memory of the shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century remains alive.
These hopes are perhaps the largest for several decades. Bolivia expects the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is to be released on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“The Bolivia’s children are getting dissipated. The inhabitants are unanimous, optimisticly set and rely on a favourable verdict,” said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolvian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will share the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that an organization based in the Hague will recognise the claim of Bolivia and, after decades of unrealistic talks, Chile will have to negotiate for the granting of independent access to the sea.
Eva Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who, in the coming year, will continue to confront the fight for reelection, and will also have hope in Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that the chances of a favourable ruling for Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations Authority, based in Hague, has no power to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. He also noted that it would not affect the determination of possible talks.
As Mr Zarate said, a Chinese expert on international law, a decision by the International Court of Justice will be made six months after the final arguments were put forward.
Unfortunately, the last four years of Bolivia have been able to turn the country apart from the target.
“The question of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolianianian administration,” Paz Zárate said.
The uninterrupted Morales rhetoric has deprived the Chilyans of any goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point resume the conversation, but it will be very difficult to face the situation.
For both countries since 1962, there has been no exchange of ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in Hague, did not agree that the decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday, Bolivia will “a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile, and the possibility of“ ending the 139-year-old dispute period with reference to mutual benefits” he said.
Calzadilla also denied the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, used the topic of access to the sea as a part of political play.
“Boliwi will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean, ” he added.
“The judgment is an excellent opportunity to believe that we need to deal with the past.
North Korea's leaders claim that nuclear weapons will not take place until they can trust the United States.
Minister for Foreign Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at the time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be on the edge of resumption of suspended nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Unem.
Ri claims that “the merson” is as though the absence of sanctions and the opposition of the US to a declaration ending the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without prior adoption by Pjongjang of concrete armed steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and the U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a widespread scepticism as to the fact that Pjongjang is serious about the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means to guarantee security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows will be showing up the latest line of great head cover in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely turn yourself in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, over-dimensional head covers in their 2019 summer collection, which were staggering in style during the Paris Fashion Week.
These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino's distinctive work was a giant beige hat decorated with a large, penal jacket with a flooding head of models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included clovens decorated with jewels, a hat wizard, and even ananasa, but they were not designed to warm their head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of peculiar masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had a dry mouth and resembled more Hannibal Lecter's style than hasute nature.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and another looked like sunk ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers assume that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
Non-dimensional hats follow just behind “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a wide-ranging 61 cm verde, which everyone had already worn, from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely unpracticable hat, which was passed through the social media, presented another great creation on the run - a straw beach bag almost as large as the model dressed in a bathing suit.
The tanned orange bag from the rafia, finished with raphies and finished with white leather hand, was distinguished by the collection of Jacques La Riviera for the summer season 2019 during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a styleist of stars, said FEMAIL: “I hope that large hats and beach bags will appear in shops for the following years, because the designer has managed to make such a big impact, it would be difficult not to use demand for over-dimensional accessories.
John Edward: language skills necessary for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have continued to enjoy their scientific achievements - in 2018 they have been able to praise other excellent results of exams, individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other social projects.
Presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of schools to which more than 30,000 students attend throughout Scotland are willing to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
The schools have an independent objective of preparing students for further and higher education, selected by their career path, and indicating their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the possibility of developing and implementing a school-specific teaching programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language that he understands, then it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes into his heart.
This is a clear reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages take the first place in league rankings, with the highest degree rates occurring for independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students learning foreign languages received a higher rating of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher grade A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an A evaluation.
This shows that schools independent in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills whose children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At the moment, language science, as subject matter for choice, is carried out in the same way as the science of STEM subjects (serious sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the context of learning programmes in independent schools and other places.
The 2014 study carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that for reasons of difficulty in planting job free by employers in 17 percent, the lack of language skills of candidates was responsible.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly needed to prepare young people for their career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language knowledge,
Skills that remain lifelong, as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, regardless of the defence of the path of professional development.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to your 2013 survey, in which over 4,000 adults took part, 75% of them were unable to speak in a foreign language as well as the French language was the only language the percentage of two-digit individuals, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign language teaching is so important to today’s children.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are most important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter the interests of the child, there will always be many languages in independent schools to choose which will be taught by specialised staff in this area.
Scottish schools are independent of the creation of a teaching environment that will prepare children and have them in the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what makes the future for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the international business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as ‘International Communication Skills’
Schools independent will continue to offer a large choice, diversity and level for Scottish youth.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, President of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Debiut LeBron on Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers finally arrived.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakers, announced that LeBron James will play a Sunday pre-son against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one, but less than 48” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers team.
Reporter of the Lakers team, Mike Trudell, reported on Twitter that James would probably play part of the minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six presonal Lakers matches.
\"At this stage of my career, I don't need to participate in preson games to prepare,\" he said.
So Trumpa electoral in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts in Wheeling tonight in West Virginia with a series of voters.
It's the first of five electoral towers planned by Trumpa to be held next week, along with attitudes in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his choice to hold free positions in the Supreme Trump Court, he aims to build up support in the forthcoming elections on a half-term government, because the Republican may be at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are given in November.
What time will it take to see Trumpa in West Virginia tonight and where will it be online?
The Trumpa electoral age in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place today at 7 p.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
So Trumpa voters in West Virginia will be able to follow live via the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings of a nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tight atmosphere in connection with the charges of inappropriate sexual behaviour, as well as the envisaged vote in the Senate on suspension of choice for a maximum period of one week, for the time being conducted by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of voters is to provide support to the Republican in the face of difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign with five towers next week aims to \"mobility of volunteers and supporters to assist the Republican in protecting and extending the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives\" - Reuters.
\"The control of Congress is such an important point in the president's schedule that as the hottest season of campaign is coming, it will visit as many states as possible\", said the spokesperson for Trump's campaign, who did not agree to give his name - Reuters.
Today's election year at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania\", as well as media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia - a state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 - for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the polls.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey when the President comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist from West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows the spirit of the fight, maintaining hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the format of the foursome held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating shuttle of despair is a completely fabricated sports concept, but one in which players really believe, and already the most in competitions like these.
So what's their distraction like at this point?
“They led six points, and now they are only four now, so I think we have a little despair,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe is, of course, leading four points, while still twelve are available.
However, Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each of them could praise three points of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams on his throat, which were marked by excitation, became more and more loud during his round, squeezing a key putt and winning the game when he and Thomas gained two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them victory with the result 15, met with a similar cry, which gives him to understand that the American team is still in the game.
“It will be enough to focus and worry about its own game” said Spieth.
It's all that's left to each of these players.
18 bucks to win.
The only players who won more points over the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the inconceivable story of Ryder Cup.
A strange but lovely couple of European teams won four of four, and she was not mistaken.
“Moliwood is the only couple that did not count bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped the bogeys in Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the hungry crowd shows that they should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential victory of the European team at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they were playing at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to discuss the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was separated from Alex Noren.
Bogey and double double double double double door on the front, they kicked Spain and Swedes into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way they can change the strategy at one time.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has a cut-off to fight in which some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe with a result of 10-6 covers the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning the 10-6 Saturday football and football matches with the United States.
Inspired duet - Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari - has brought the gray with two victory over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing its current Le Golf National score to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorna, trying to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the German team in the morning football format, winning a series of 3-1.
The United States has become more resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches, but they couldn't make any losses.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyka's team has to get eight points from 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who won four points in a row, while along with Molinarim (the group was named “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend) is only the second pair in Ryder Cup history, which gained four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed's football format, they beat the bloated Woods and the American debuter Bryson Dechambeau, getting even more empathic 5&4.
Woods, who was tired of two Saturday games, occasionally showed a flash of genius, but lost 19 of 29 games in football and football formats, and seven of a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning version of football, returned to Henrika Stensona in the foursome format to beat the score of 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in global ranking 1 and 3 respectively.
However, the European team did not go all the way after thinking about this pleasant, cold day in a field that went south west of Paris.
Three-time leader Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up a reference point for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory against Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the football format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has happened to make the team a four-point loss, starting singles, although Furika's team would only be remissable to preserve the trophy.
However, in the second place two days ago, a Sunday counterplay seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says, “a permanent non-monstrative weaponry without trust.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN speech that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in North Korea to the United States and there is no way that this country will unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the General Assembly of the year that North Korea took “the means of good will, such as halting nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling nuclear trials and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see any specific response from the US, however,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no one-sided weapons of North Korea.”
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints regarding Washington’s failure to ‘stage’ approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, its statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denucerisation as in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump on the first in the history of the summit between the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea, held on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to work for the “denuclarisation of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (born 1950 to 953), but the United States representative announced that Pjongjang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also supported calls to mitigate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on “denucerarisation in the first place, and increases pressure through sanctions, in order to achieve their goal in a forced manner, even against signing “the declaration of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“The statement that sanctions can put us on our knees is the clouds of people who act against us in a ignorant way.
However, the problem is that the lack of sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Une and Donald Trump, which he spoke about at the beginning of the week, the United States leader in the United Nations Forum.
Instead, the Minister noted three meetings between Kim Jong Unem and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: “If the party had been South Korea and not the United States, then there was no such an impasse regarding the denuclarisation of the Korean peninsula.
Mim that, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to the previous year, when he said this at the UN General Assembly, that the purpose of the North Korea rocket in the United States was inevitable after \"Mr Evil President\" Trump called Kim Jong Una \"rocket man\" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations Trump Forum, which threatened to “all damage” in North Korea, praised Kim Jong Una for his courage to take steps to armament, but also said that he needed to put a lot of work into place last year, and he also said that until North Korea is deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions will not be abolished.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not assign a time interval to it, saying: “It does not matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the United Nations Security Council: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue and be permanent until we find a full, final and verified denuclarisation.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea, trying to choke the financing of the Pjongyang Nuclear Programme and Ballistic Missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and said later that he would visit Pjongjang next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but its last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which, during several hours, North Korea condemned him for “the creation of gangster demands“
North Korea has committed itself this month at the meeting with Moon Jae-in that it will deassemble the site of the rocket testing and the nuclear complex if the United States take ‘the appropriate measures’.
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that “the appropriate measures he cares about are security guarantees that Trump committed to Singapore and to take steps to normalise his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course for adequate long rest
A new course at Harvard University this year provided students with more sleep, which was intended to fight the growing culture of macho, consisting of “all-night students driven by caffeine”
Students from the world's best university often have no idea of the basis for self - care.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that according to him is the first such type in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired by a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
“ After the speech, one girl came to me and said: “Why is it said to me only now that I am in the last year of my studies?
She felt that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep that surprised me, said The Telegraph.
During the course that took place for the first time this year, it explains to students how good sleep-related habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the general well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Director of the University of Health, said that this course was decided to introduce after the fact that students had suffered a serious lack of sleep during the week.
An hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a view of the room in the dormitory where students click coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light and how sleep shortage affects sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not lead to an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just like everyone else, they have the right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking,\" said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride from “the entire science,” he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of lack of sleep.
The provision of sufficient sleep with good quality should be “other weapons - students combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even allowing them to avoid taking weight because lack of sleep causes the brain to pass through the hunger mode, so that the student is constantly hungry,” he said.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler in developing a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press on the campus course.
The next step, according to him, is to invite all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of studies before going to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set up a reminder alarm when to go to sleep and when you need to get up, and that they also be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can spray the daily rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes care of Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered once again during the fight at the Livingston exit, when Dolly Menga took his shot to defeat Steven Gerrard's disassembled team, winning the 1-0 score.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record its first victory since the 4-1 triumph recorded in February on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 matches, causing a difference in eight points for his team compared to the leader of the Laddbrokes Premiership - Hearts.
Menga shot a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' composition, showing no commitment, did not look to improve.
While Rangers noticed a decline in the sixth place, Livingston grew up third, just behind Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have another problem with the need to get the head of the Caluma Spence line judge's head off after he was hit with the subject from the call for guests.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which allowed Ayr to break down and go to Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same eleven Livingston, who took the head of the Hearts team last week, being a thrilling way in which his well-trained team was tired at every step of its opponents.
Rangers may have dominated having a ball, but that's what Livingston did more with the ball when they got it.
They were supposed to get a goal in just two minutes, when Menga's first set of balls allowed Scott Pittman to face the goal of Allan McGregor, but the assistant didn't use his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep free turn to Captain Craig Halket, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, playing as defender, could only remain in the rear position.
Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had been punished for fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson divorced Colombian's claim.
Rangers were able to give only two customs shots in the first half, but there was a goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely concerned with the head of Lassany Coulibala and a weak shot by Ovie's Eyaria.
While winning by Livingston in 34 million goal opening the match could be the opposite of the game course, no one can deny that they earned it for their efforts to win it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with a deep constant piece of Jacobs game.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in Scott Robinson, who kept his peace, putting the Menga in order to make a simple move.
Gerrard did not hide in the break and exchange Coulibaly on Ryan Kent, and this swap almost immediately made an impact on the wingman who put the ball in Morelos, but impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to attract guests to the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett had long applications one after another.
Holt's team could've increased driving in the last few minutes, but McGregor's got a good start before Jacobs, and Lithgow played the corner game.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, had hope for a penalty shot once again, when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes off again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now the website from our issue “Sunday Morning” Almanac: September 30, 1882 - 136 years ago... the day that was born in Germany was the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans - Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger’s counter has become a part of science and pop culture, such as the film “Bells of Coronado, from 1950, where you appeared to be clearly unlikely cowboys-training Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you will hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals -
Evans: “Now you hear something.
“Hans - Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name has survived until today.

The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the enemy cells during treatment.
This method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in the lab.
At that time, they can “certain the protein common to many cancers, and then they are injected again into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a student immune system, hostile cells have been observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory, so that they can “check the protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject it to the patient of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Raka in Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our results show that this vaccine is doing very well,
HER2 “over several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovary, lung and colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of immune cells from patients and “hearting” - their localization of cancer cells has worked in the treatment of certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West is going to the pro-trum diamond in the Saturday Night Live program, with the MAGA hat on her head.

Star Game of the throne Kit Harington moves on the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snov in the Middle Ages of the HBO “Tron game”
31-year-old actor hit the hero stereotype macho, saying that showing such roles on screen causes young boys often think they have to play tough to be respected.
By interviewing Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “it did not go that far, and he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.

“I personally feel pretty sure about that moment, where we made a mistake about masculinity,” he said.
\"What we taught men during their growing up, looking from the perspective of the problem that we are dealing with now -
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity can be partly responsible for television because of the presentation of very male characters.
He said: “What attitudes are born, and what manners?
What learns on TV and on the streets, what makes young boys start to think they have to stand on a specific side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time - what can we do to change that?

HIV/Aids: China record a 14 % increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820 000 people affected by this problem, as health professionals in this country have been reported.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by gender, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected in this way was almost completely reduced, as the Chinese health officials said at the conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to one year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination between LGBT people is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, research estimates that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease transfer are due to insufficient safeguards when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines in its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters opposes one of its members to disclose the data of Senators of the Republican Party, namely “insecure lies, and“ conspiracy theory.
Member of the Chamber of Representatives of the United States, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday, as if a member of its team had posted a personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party has provided that these accusations have been removed by experts and websites associated with “ultravare wings”
“The lies, lies, and even more impeccable lies,” said Waters in the Twitter statement.
Public information included similar home addresses and numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was placed by an unknown person in the Chapter during the Senate hearing of the panel on the charges of sexual offences against the nominated Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took some time to question Kavanaugh's candidate for three senators.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was linked to the Waters' Office and published information on the Waters member, as said by Hill.
“This unfounded charge is completely false, and it is a hundred percent lie,” Waters continued.
‘My team's identity, personal data and security were infringed as a result of these cheating and false charges, in no way was responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded charge is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie--
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer’s former White House pressist.
“This way of denial is bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that it does not have an adequate temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's being accused of something he didn't do, it can't be bad.
He can't provoke.
He can't question the motives of the person making the charge.
He must remain calm for that.
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overexact during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate starting in mid-term elections to replace him as Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Gruba, if that’s true, ” he wrote on Tweeter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these cheating accusations--
\"The lawyers will be de masked and put to legal responsibility for all their actions which pose a threat to any member of my team,\" she said.
Cinema review Johnny English: Nokaut - spy parody with weakened Rénádná Atkinson
Looking for a reference to Brexit in any new film with British thread has already become a standard. This seems to apply to a new part of the series of action films and comedy “Johnny English”, which started in 2003 since the film “Johnny English”, and which returned to cinema screen in 2011 with “Johnny English: Reactivation”
Will a self-receptive satare about how hopeless we are to become a new export product of the country?
In any case, it is always surprised, with a rubber face, uncompetable Johnny English, that he has received a batch license again - his name and name more than anything else signals that it is a built-in commie designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange resemblance to the smootie glamour, has a little bit of the Inspector Clouseau, Jasia Beani's Wing and a drop from this guy adding one note to the music theme of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a global tourist, Atkinson played once in the forgotten commercials of Barclaycard, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series, there is one or two moments of attention.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, being dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by a centrifuge.
On the screen you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson for physical playing comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially since now also “a serious film brand such as 007 and Mission Impossible, they offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humoristic elements seem to be directed to children rather than adults, according to me, the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as creative and consistent as the gagas in the silent films of Atkinson about Jasius Beani.
From always the current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
Cyberhaker passes to the British super-titious spy network, revealing the identity of all British intelligence agents operating in the field, to the abuse of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
It's the last drop in the show's gorilla premiere, which is a pumped figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, getting in the form of Theresa May, but the script doesn't give her the opportunity to develop a wing.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that, due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to restore to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving informal lessons about how to become a secret agent, a couple of good gags while giving spy lessons by English.
English is called to Whitehall to re-connect with his former Bough helper, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with the commander of a submarine, a noble but a slightly tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of the party in Her Majesty's secret service are returning to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletov, the character played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the Prime Minister is dangerously controlled by the charismatic billionaire technology, which claims to solve the British computer problems, is Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their cruelness with absurd situations: they burn down a French restaurant for the waiters; they enter chaos, smuggle themselves on the deck of the luxury yacht Volty; and English gets a desolation when using a set to virtual reality to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
In this last sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite a nice and music performance, the whole film very resembles television for children.
Typical diameter.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't resist my thoughts: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be his talent?
The work party contradicts it as if it developed a plan for the British four-day working week for which they will receive a salary for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Working Party will consider introducing a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary for five days.
The party has said that the managers of the company will provide savings to employees through the revolution associated with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
This would enable employees to enjoy the three-day weekend by getting the same salary.
Sources say that this idea will “sign into the political agenda of the party and plans to leave the country against workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way of using employees to change the economy.
The older member of the Labour Party in the talk of The Sunday Times said: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year.
“It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is something that is included in the approach of the party to restore economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the lot.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea, the Green Party committed itself to a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Ombudsman of the Labour Party said: “The International Working Week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it.
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used the last week's Labour Party Conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from “distors without the face,” and “compulsors” in public interest companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share, because the Government of the Labour Party could do “receivables, based on detected abuse.
He also confirmed the plans for the establishment of employees in company boards and the creation of integrated ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the equity of private workers who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are responsible for the “60 minutes” program, asking if the FBI’s investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their attitude.
The FBI's case of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised questions about whether the findings of the inquiry's office could lead the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview conducted by the program “60 minutes”, Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover something that might change their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh when I went to the hearing.
I called him after it happened when the charge came up, and I asked him, \"You did it.\"
He was firm, determined and clear -
However, Graham's opinion seems to be carved in stone.
“I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and that a strong charge is needed to change it,” he said.
“ Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” added Graham, returning to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the persons he gives could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change.
What is the event of Global Citizen Festival and has in any way contributed to reducing the level of poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held next Saturday in New York, a year's musical event that can be honored with an extremely impressive composition of the stars and an equally impressive mission - the destruction of poverty in the world.
The seventh time Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of this event, which is the liquidation of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is the extension of Global Overty Project, an international group of activists to fight poverty by increasing the number of actively fighting people.
To get a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or “actions, such as volunteering, sending emails to the global leader, making a phone or other significant action to help raise awareness about the goal of poverty eradication.
But what success can Global Citizen take in the 12 years of the rest to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case called “clithism”, when people feel that they do something important, by signing online petitions or putting an entry on Tweeter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported more than 19 million “actions, people supporting action, seeking to achieve many different objectives.
It also claims that these activities helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and regulations worth over 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2,25 billion people up to 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group has allocated 390 commitments and claims arising from its activities, which have already paid or financed at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that the secured measures have so far made a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key obligations include The Power of Nutrition, the British Partnership of Investors and Realizers involved in “supporting children to achieve their full potential, which promised to transfer Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in this country, after the Global Citizen members sent over 4700 tweets.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members, such as you, we can make social injustice, which is malnutrition, go into history - Tracey Ulman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions calling on Great Britain to improve mother and child nutrition quality, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with nutrition problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which sounded “In the sense of certainty that extreme poverty will be eliminated,” he said.
Global quote answered as follows: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will be walking around and dealing with failure.
But like in the case of some major movements for civil rights and combating apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars present during this year's event in New York, whose hosts will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a war jacket to “blocks - Russian energy exports - Secretary of Home Affairs
Washington is able to “where necessary” to flee to his Navy in order to prevent the invasion of Russian energy in the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially where it works at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for the exploration of new energy markets.
\"I believe that the reason for which they are in the Middle East is the desire to broker energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe,\" he said.
According to the official, there are ways and measures to solve this problem.
“The United States has the opportunity to make sure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a lock to ensure that their energy does not go to the market” he said.
Zineke spoke to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which himself refers to as “the consumer of energy” in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, seeing that they really are the same.
“The economic policy of Iran and Russia consists of less use and replacement of fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to “the one-stop-fueler with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared when Trumpa's administration continues a mission aimed at increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe - which is much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including the same president of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the “Inappropriate” project of Nord Stream 2, which according to Trumpa made Berlin “slave - Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 pipeline with a value of 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion hundred meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that the ardent opposition to Washington to the implementation of this project is due solely to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
\"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressures and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers\", said the Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States has led to a violent response from Germany, which has confirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called upon the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I believe it is a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Federation (BDI), after the recent German Chancellor Angeli Mercel and President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she'd consider running for the President in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday, that after the mid-term elections, they would consider the candidate for the president.
During the meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidate.
“It was time for women to go to Washington and fix a corrupt government. It is also the woman who is the highest ranked position,” she said, The Hill.
\"After 6 November, I will consider my candidate for President's position:
During Warren’s meeting, she mentioned the President Donald Trumpie, saying that “he will lead the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very worried about what Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren expressed her criticism against Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.
However, published on Thursday, the survey showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should run in 2020.
Fivety-eight percent of the voters of Massachusetts choosing the option “unlessly” said that the senator should not run as a result of the survey carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Davala Patrick, 38 percent supported his potential candidate, and 48 percent were opposed to it.
Other known names from the democratic camp were taken from the attention of the potential candidate in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make a formal decision by January as she gave the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress team (PTSD) of Track Palin during Donald Trump's electoral tower
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq following the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
\"As my own son goes through, which must go back, I understand other families who feel the effects of the PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return,\" said the audience at Donald Trump's constituency at Tuls in Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son “the taboo climate,” after which she said about her son and other war vets:“ they return a little different, they return, they return, wondering if there will be respect for what their soldiers, pilots, and all the other members of the army have given themselves their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilli, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence on a woman, inciting false testimony in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of distress, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the D.A. Wasilli Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims who flee from the gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and districts have deposited on Friday in Washington a list of amicus curias to support asylum seekers who are struggling with this policy, as the NBC News states.
The full name of the flood in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against federal politics, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his brutal sons of the gang were harassing her, but the American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as countries facing common gang problems and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy has repealed the decision of Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Colombia, said in Friday's statement that the new policy “ ignores existing state, federal and international law for decades.
‘Federial law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle, as described in the amicus curit list.
The prosecutors further argued in the letter that a policy refusing immigrants to enter harm the economy of the United States, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and “think the necessary labour force,”
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Session ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and that gang-related violence.
‘Azyl is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national, or because of belonging to a specific social group or having other political beliefs,’ said Sessions in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asyl was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious ones with whom people around the world are struggling every day.
Desperacic rescue attempts in the Palu in a situation where the number of deaths doubled into a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Ris Kusum’s 35 - year - old mother, comforting her angry son in the evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
‘An ambulance will import the body every minute.
There is no clean water.
The residents were seen returning to destroyed houses, searching over the water of things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, moved fast.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and arm, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of strong secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes, as he was talking about a violent earthquake that shocked the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that shared with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed into a Romanian wall,” Haris said Ascensor Press, adding that his family came to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, and she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe -
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of ‘priving’ advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper put a four-page commercial in an American newspaper that would approve the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American propaganda press.
The president of the United States Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, undermining China's attempt to interfere with the elections to the United States Congress, which will take place on November 6, China contradicts this plea.
Putting up Trumpa on the fact that Beijing tried to interfere with the elections in the United States confirmed what the American officials said to the Reuters that this is a new stage in the escalation of Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal that foreign governments place advertising promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently driving an escalation of trade wars that led to an increase in customs duty on mutual imports.
Chinese recovery tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to touch exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Trumpa party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing caused harm to American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the article on Sunday, Des Moines Register, that China “with double force starts harassing, putting propaganda advertising in our own free press”
“With its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the perceived American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, putting a paid advertising at Des Moines Register”, wrote Branstad.
For this, there will be no votes against in Beijing in the kiosk street and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinions which the Chinese might have on the unsettling economic direction of China, given that the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish - his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans face each other's choices against women's mid-term elections with the right to vote through the Kavanaugh affair, warn analysts
While many leading Republicarys support and defend themselves nominated for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault charges, the analyst warns that you will meet during the forthcoming mid-term elections with a violent response, especially from women.
The violence accompanying this event is extremely large, and most Republicans are officially voting.
“This can not be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether the efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Arison) regarding the conduct of the FBI's last investigation are enough to calm down the angry voters.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it until November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and the national progressive group MoveOn, as the newspaper was published in Washington.
On Friday morning, protesters scandaled the word “The West of November”, demonstrating in the Senate because of the determination by the Republican governing the Commission, that Kavanaugh did not withdraw its nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as he gave Mic.
“The democratic level of enthusiasm and motivation is being detected outside the scale,” said one of Stu Rothenberg’s information pages, the impartial political analyst.
“ People say that he was already tall, and it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided women with predominance and younger voters aged between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she described her sexual assault charges at the address of the candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the candidate, it would meet with a violent response.
“The Republican Party must deal with a small mess,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, as NBC News says.
“It is not only for the vote of committee or final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be chosen, it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, the director of the United States priority, a group that helps with the election of Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be slightly divided into those who believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little greater support for the latter.
The new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or rather believed in Ford's testimonies, while 35 percent said that Kavanaugh's testimony was definitely or rather believed.
In addition, 38% of respondents claimed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during the submission of the testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI began an investigation of the allegations of Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, whom Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
The Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Board of Judges that Kavanaugh attacked it at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that he was nominated for the Supreme Court to present his genitality at the time of his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of World Wide Web, launches startup, which is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of technology legends, Inrupt, is a company based on open source platform, Solid, owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of creating Inrupt was “dominance over the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to launch.
“The last historic moment,
The application uses Solid Platform technology to enable people to create their own \"on-line blindness with personal data\" or otherwise specify.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the online store with personal data is that completely depends on the user who has access to which information.
The company calls it “personally fullness through data”
According to the company president, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help provide the Solid Platform to all people.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project and the development community.
From this week onwards, the technology creators around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that will bring up all their business models from day to day.
“They are not asked for permission, ” he said.
In a Saturday on the Berners-Lee Metro platform, he wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on the basis of a Solid platform,
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded World Wide Web Consortium in the Technology Institute in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been providing a lot of support in the debate on network neutrality.
By calling on Inrupt Berners-Lee's life, he will remain the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very excited to think about the next era in the development of the network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the honour of the spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which, during World War I, was awarded by the Cross of Victoria, was taught 100 years later in his home town.
The album by Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed four days later by a sniper, never knowing he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren put a stone commemorating during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that putting the stone down exactly in the hundredth anniversary of the designation of the grandfather was “a particularly symbolic character.
As London Newspaper says, on September 29, 1918, Vann had led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong force of the field and machine weapons department.
He then speeded up to the line of fire and with “the greatest courage,” he led it forward, and in the only case he launched an attack on the position of the field department, leaving three of them behind.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “anything why I would never be able to meet, but also humble.
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he gave his son a parade after the end of the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to take part in the parade,” said Michael Vann, “the courage of the true hero is shown in support of many who receive it. ”
Fans of MMA didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got the Pig Peppa.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to watch the calculated emotions of the Bellator 206 gal, and eventually you can't see the main fight.
The gali program in San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 am, when Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald prepared to fight, the viewers in Britain were shocked by the change of their program to the Świnka Peppa.
Some were disappointed after they didn't burn until early morning hours specifically to see this fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the exchange for children's cartoons as “some sick joke,
\"In accordance with the Government Regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate to leave it at 6:00 a.m., making it necessary to change to the programme for children\", said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, when asked for transmission.
‘Peppa's bitch, yes.’
President of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they'd work out a schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about the situation again, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday morning, for which we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we had a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical break.
But it wasn't just a matter of law.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six, which is to the standard quantity.
It's a unfortunate situation -
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “grower because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jump in the water, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program, Lauren Laverne said that he spoke about gay rights to give others “the hope, ”
He also said that he was going to be a parent, making him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual leading this program for many years, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of the disease.
As Daley first appeared in the program, he said that when he grew up, he felt “at least valuable, from others, because “one time he liked boys and girls was socially acceptable, ” he said.
He said: “To date, this feeling of lower value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed. ”
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “worthy, not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-breasted Olympic medalist became the public activist of the LGBT community and used his performance at this year's Games of the United Nations in Australia to appeal to a greater number of countries for the decriminisation of homosexuality.
He said that he had decided to express himself because he felt happy to live openly, without any implicacies, and wanted to give others “the hope. ”
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American filmer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, “he became surprised,” he said.
Daley and Oscar (who is 20 years older from him) took part last year, indicating that such a difference in age was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so many young times,” he meant his first Olympiad at the age of 14 and father’s death because of cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult for him to find someone in the same age who experienced similar heights and falls.
The couple stayed in June with parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Next. Daley said that his perception had completely changed.
“ Last year, it was the most important thing for me to get the gold medal, ” he said.
\"And you know what? There are more important things than golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie -
His son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets for the Olympics in London in 2012 - he wanted to take place in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him: “You will not be with us to be in the first row, Dad”” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died, I understood that he was not accomplished” he said.
Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the brown.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to jump into the water before the crowd of people in the Olympic Games - it was the best feeling of possible ones - he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song - the Proud in the performance of Heather Small - which accompanied him during preparation for the Olympic Games and which continues to make him a goose skin.
The Desert Island Discs program is issued at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no form of Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday part of Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his form so she won't shut off her 15.
Mickelson, playing for once twelve every two years at the event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik for Saturday's football and football games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-time major winner had to spend the day on the team and working on improving his game in the hope of correcting the cause of his reference to the bench.
The 48-year-old who has never given the simplest strokes, even at the peak moment of his career, does not necessarily check well on a tight Le Golf National field, at which the wrong strikes are badly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself isn't dismaying enough for Mickelson, it must face the British Open winner's ninth game on Sunday, Francesc Molinari, who joined forces with the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start playing with a string, Mickelson's match can prove extremely crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, rather than could not do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, he knocked me on his back, and took my hand and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the gallery famous and has made a lot of contribution to the game of his bands both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it turned out we had to do it anyway.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else--
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which has never compared to his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins on his account, 20 failures, and seven remissses. Furik said his presence had brought much to the band.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, witty, ridiculous, and it’s good to have it in the team’s room,” he explained.
“I think young players had a good time with him this week, what was nice to see.
Its person claims much more than just a game.
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a large point advantage can be reduced soon.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the single starts on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily transform into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in a match in Valderam's field, where, along with the accompanying Vice-President Sev Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over Americans, but the finish line was the shortest of the possible hair, winning 141-2-131-31-2.
“We can’t forget that we had a great advantage in Valderamera’s field; we also had a great advantage on Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderam’s field we won only the hair,” said Bjorn, on the photo after the 5-3 Class of 2018 won both on Friday and yesterday, which led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You're giving yourself everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do whatever's right.
It'll only be over when points appear on the board.
We have a purpose to win the trophy, and we need to concentrate on that.
From the beginning, I said that I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who people are on the opposite side - the best players in the world -
Bjorn, delighted by his players in a difficult field, added: “I would not do better.
But tomorrow is different.
The single starts tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with a partner when everything goes out of mind, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limits of opportunities.
That's the message you have to give to the players, it'll give you everything tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything to himself:
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorna, will expect his players to achieve better results in a single game than with a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three points with four.
Sam Furik experienced large returns of the last day’s action as a member of the winning team in Brookline, followed by failure after the European team made “the honor in Medinah”
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, warmed up for fighting his players on the last day.
“We are playing 12 important games,” you would like to start playing fast, as it took place on Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this drive goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our composition properly and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to spell tomorrow's day.
Thomas was entrusted with the task of tackling Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other players of the European team in the leading half of the program.
\"I decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he'd be able to play during the whole game,\" Bjorn said about his single election.
New German Warship reinstated
The latest German Navy fregata should be put to use in 2014 in order to replace the ageing warships from the Cold War, but this will not take place until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing costs, as local media have given.
The assignment to the use of ‘Rheinland-Pfalaz’ is the main ship of the new band Baden-Wuerttemberg, which was transferred to the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit gave her newspaper, referring to the words of a military spokesperson.
The ship should be included in the warship in 2014, but as a result of the problems that occurred after delivery, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
Four units of Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fregates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful section, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-shipping missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, including reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance - the operation of new fregate should be possible for even two years away from home ports.
However, continuing delays mean that these modern warships, which are intended to allow the Germans to respond to foreign situations, will be obsolete at the start of the service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fregata appeared on the front pages of the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blodom & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the yard after delivery.
Not much was known about the causes behind the return, but the German media informed about a number of key “fishing and equipment” that made the ship useless in the fight mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because Baden-Wuertemberg ships were to be operated by an crew of around 120 sailors, which is half less than the Bremen class fregat.
It has also proved that the ship is far too heavy, thus reducing its performance and limiting the possibility of the Navy to carry out future modernisation.
It is believed that the 7000 tonnes of ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” is twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the whole project, including crew training.
It is said that it reached a stunning level of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new ferrets are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings on the fact that the forces of the German sea fleet are shrinking.
At the beginning of this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the sailors “will end ships capable of using.”
He also said that the problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from the exploitation of old units without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfiedness that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's fregage could have been included in the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on the property in the Scottish Highlands area is intended to show how bats use the landscape when obtaining food.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and to help target future measures to protect them.
The research conducted by scientists from National Trust for Scotland will cover cartilages of common and minors, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of red nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property special loggers will be deployed to follow the activity of bats.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the manner in which each species behave.
Then a habitat map and a report will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor in the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout Britain have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the municipalities and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as are flys on flies and certain chemicals used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to night’s hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching the prey.
They use a complex technology of eco-labelling to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, control of the master, and sometimes even rescue shares.
The organization even founded the first and only in Scotland dedicated to the reserve of bats on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is a home for eight of the ten Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the owner of the estate, says it's for bats the perfect territory.
“Threave has a wonderful area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowingly things about the bats. The work that we do here and in other estates will help us to understand better what they need to grow.
It underlines the importance of checks for bats before accession to maintenance work in the estates, as the inadvertent destruction of one guard can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected - their killing, harassing or disturbing them, and their goal is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We have so much to learn about our bats, and for many species, we do not even know how they manage their populations.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while his lawyers intend to sue the German warehouse
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the charges against him regarding rape as “fake news” saying that people “will want to promote themselves, using its name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German information magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
Portugal's attacker Juventus was accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's reports, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay a woman $750,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the announcement of charges, in an instagram live transmission to his 142 million followers identified these reports as “face news”
\"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news,” said the five-fold winner of the gold ball.
\"They want to promote using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine,\" added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing for the appeal of Der Spiegel’s magazine in connection with the charges that they have called “inadvertible notice of suspicion in the area of privacy,” reports Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer will demand compensation for “the moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years,”
There was a direct entry in June 2009 in Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at Ronaldo and Mayor's night club, they said they went to the football room, where he allegedly raped a woman anally, as evidenced by the documents lodged in Clark County District Court Court Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after a alleged attempt and told her that at “99 percent he was a good guy, who was visited by this “one percent” -
According to Ronaldo's records, she confirmed that she had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital took photos of her injuries, but later agreed to an extra-court settlement because “she was afraid of retaliation - and “public humiliation. ”
34-year-old says he wants to invalidate the settlement now, because he still can't forget about the alleged approach.
During his alleged assault, Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: United Kingdom “after all times, it would be regrettable to leave car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will reap it after all times, if, after leaving the European Union, the world leader had lost its status in car production, Greg Clark said the Minister of Business.
He added that “he was concerned, when the representative of Toyota UK said in an interview for the BBC, that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, production in a factory in Burnston near Derby will be temporarily suspended.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which manufactures Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
\"I believe that if Great Britain comes out of the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then it will stop production in our factory,\" said Marvin Cooke, the manager of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexicie.
The main concerns are, as car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of leaving the European Union by Great Britain without agreement.
The Toyot production line operates on the principle of ‘just-in-time’ within which parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU in the case of custom-made vehicles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without supplying its factory in Derbyshire, so production would have been suspended.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresy May plan on future relations with the EU is “precially designed to avoid border controls -
“We need an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy this success, but will also allow us to make the right use of this situation,” said BBC Radio 4.
‘A certificate not only of Toyota but of other producers shows that we must be able to continue what was composed of a very efficient set of supply chains;
Toyoty's representative was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the company's competitiveness, resulting in a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at a plant in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the U.S. Works council, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are destroyed, they will never be restored again.
The Ombudsman said: “We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union,
The Trumpa meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, as the White House says.
A major meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein may be “for another week, due to the lack of fighting for a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, as he gave the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's work to investigate the possibility of interference between the Russians in the election, the link between the close colleagues of Trumpa and Russia, and the potential to hinder justice by the President.
Whether Trump releases the Deputy Attorney General, threatening Mueller's independence for months is a hot topic in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times newspaper said that Rosenstein spoke about hearing with him for the purpose of recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from his post on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he were to give up his resignation.
The deadline for meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not release Rosenstein. There's been a trial to avoid collide with the audition of the Senate's court committee, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in Senata.
Trumpa press spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News Station.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll definitely inform the press about this.
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders had not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Chris Wallace, running the program, asked for the reason.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences is not caused by the willingness to “maintentious, television journalists,” she added:“ I will not hide that they are “ostentacious, ”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“ The president, today, is performing more “the questions and answers” sessions than any other president before him, said, adding without giving evidence: “We have been familiar with numbers.
Press conferences will continue to take place, said Sanders, but “If journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done this very often. Press conferences will resolve places like this, during which you will be able to speak directly with the President of the United States -
Trump regularly responds to questions during leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with hosted dignitarians.
Sonic press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may have demonstrated why he is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the collected journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has applied a letter to workers from European Union countries employed in the Scottish Health Service to convey their gratitude to them from the country and to ask that they do not leave for Brexia.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the European Union for less than six months until the United Kingdom leaves.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of examining applications for ‘settled status’ for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations on the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union were continued in the summer.
The British Government also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing period for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of his nationality.
The EU and non-EU colleagues have a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery as a result of head trauma
The racing team of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, performed an operation due to a head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with a failure from Tennessee with a result of 31-27, informed Mike organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told the journalists that the player suffered trauma shortly before the end of the first half.
“He came to the side line, after which he moved to the ground,” said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line, and they put it on their feet and carried it out to carry out further research.
The Tennis State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville (Tinnessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no further details regarding the type of trauma or the size of the trauma - and Tennessee State is trying to determine when this injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student released from university representation per year to undercut his skills) plays his first season at Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game ended, he had five grays, which gives him 18 grays all season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher tax fees when buying real estate in Great Britain
According to the new plan of tory buyers from abroad, higher tax fees will be charged for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. In this way, funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move is intended to bring down Jeremy Corbyn's success towards attracting a young electorate.
The increase in tax charges will include persons who do not tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury foresees that it will receive even £ 120 million per year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will inform today that foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be charged with higher tax fees and thus obtained additional resources will be intended to help homeless people.
This move is taken as an attempt to destroy Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young electorate by promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden of more earners.
Higher tax fees will apply to individuals and non-tax companies in Britain. Additional measures are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
An additional fee, charged in addition to the current tax fee, including two years ago higher rates for second houses and apartments bought for rent, can be up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects this move to get even £ 120 million per year.
13 percent of newly built properties in London are estimated to be bought by residents of other countries, leading to an increase in prices and hinders the purchase of the first home or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy real estates and spend most of their time outside the country, many wealthy regions - and especially the capital - have turned into “a city of spirits, ”
The new rules are only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the tax fees to help young people buy the first house.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by taking up land, but not using it. He also called Prime Minister May to remove low-cost housing limits in order to eliminate the “habitant of housing” in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the eviction “for no reason,”
He also wants to give local authorities greater powers in building new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that as Prime Minister, I am engaged in rebuilding the British dream of making every generation's life better than the previous one.
This also means correcting our dedicated housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here which is hard working British residents.
For too many people the dream of their own home became very distant, for this humiliation related to the need to sleep on the street remains above that of real -
Jack Ross: “My greatest ambition is to become Scotland’s selectionary.
The Sunderland team trainer, Jack Ross, says that his “most ambition” is to become a Scottish selecter at some point.
This 40-year-old Scotland works with the commitment to heal North-East, which currently takes third place in League One with a three-point loss in relation to the best team.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after he introduced St Mirren's club back to Scottish Premiership in the last season.
\"I wanted to represent my country as a professional,
But I only managed to get to B,\" said Ross in an interview for BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched with the father of Scotland’s game in Hampden, and I was always attracted to it.
However, this possibility will only come if I succeed as a club coach -
Among Ross’s predecessors, Dick Advocaat, David Moyas, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were found as coach of Sunderland.
Former Coach Alloa Athlatic claims that he does not feel embarrassed, taking part in such outstanding figures in such a large club, rejecting previous proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Today, success will be measured to me whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and facilities it has, it certainly adds.
“I will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have been successful here, only if I succeed.
Ross' coach lasts only three years. Before that, he was the assistant coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months was a team of Hearts trainers.
Then Alloa helped re-enact after degrading to the third league, and in the following season he led the team St Mirren from the edge of the fall to the championship title.
Jack Ross claims that now he feels much more comfortable than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was a real turning point,” says Coach Allo.
“I really believed that running the team was much better than playing.
It's weird, because as a professional, I've done well, I've made a lot of money, and I've achieved a few fatal successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week, you have to take over situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure about the work of the coach, but I feel good about it.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it.
All the interview in Sportsound can be listened on Sunday, September 30 on Scotland's radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Research shows that the best beer port is 17.30 on Saturday.
The heat wave flying caused a rapid inflow of customers to British pubs, but it crashed a hive in the restaurant nets.
Research showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants it fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting company, who developed the data, says: “A huge heat and longer than expected England’s share in World Championships, has made the results similar to the June, when the turnover in pubs increased by 2,8 percent, with the difference that restaurants’ earnings have fallen even more.
As noted in June 1,8 % drop in sales in restaurants in July, it has increased even further.
The offering drinks pubs and bars have managed to the best, their sales growth has increased the decline in restaurants.
Food pubs also suffered during heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars has increased by 6,6 percent in this month, and the food has fallen by three percent -
Paul Newman from the RSM analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry says: “This results are recorded in the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
The main factors affecting consumption of 'outside home' remain weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that the restaurants’ networks are experiencing difficult times, not surprising, although the decline in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly serious consequences when taking into account constant pressure on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favourable time for owners of food-serving sites and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the necessary respiration.
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is involved in monitoring sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one for five children, some at the age of only 11, has secret accounts in social networks that they hide from parents and teachers
The survey conducted among 20 000 graduates of secondary schools showed an increase in the number of ‘fake Insta’ pages.
These Witnesses have become concerned that their sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of students said that they had “most” accounts that show parents
One for five children, some at the age of only 11, is setting up accounts in social networks that do not reveal adults.
An action carried out among 20 000 graduates of secondary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of accounts “Fake Insta” - the name refers to the Instagram service in which you can share photos.
This knowledge has inspired the fear that these accounts serve to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students admitted that they had a “primarily” account that shows parents, and besides, they also have private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally touched the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, encountered a teenager who spoke to others to “be raped. ”
The study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters- and Headmasters- Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of pupils aged 11 to 18 are leading two profiles. Half of them are admitted to maintaining private accounts.
The President of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is worrying that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be “the head of athletes” on the board of Scottish Athlatics
During the annual meeting of the management board of the Scottish Athlatics Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as the director of non-executors.
Eilidh Doyle is the most titled Scottish lightietlet. President Ian Beattie has identified this move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience that she gained in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect for the Scottish, British and world-wide lightattaves, and we are confident that its introduction to the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish Lightlets,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased that I will be able to convey the voice of athletes to the council, and I hope that I will be able to really help in managing sports in Scotland,
The American, who has a victory among its four golden Olympic medals in the race for 200 and 400 metres on the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and now regularly occurs in the BBC as an expert, cannot be a result of a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “In fact, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said time would show if I could get back to efficiency and to what extent.
It was a cassette job, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again and I went back to training!

Promotion of lactatings that compare mothers to cows, raises extreme emotions on the Internet
The company producing lactatings has caused a storm on the Internet by publishing an advertisement that compares to breastfed mothers.
In order to announce the entry into the market of “the world’s first silent lactator to wear under his clothes, its producer, Elvie, published a gloomy advertising in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it provides to mothers.
It presents four true mothers dancing in a court of a giant to a song that hears the words: ‘Yes, I am touched, but I do not see the tail, and “As you do not notice, it is not only my boobs replaced,”
Refren goes this way: “Leave them out, forget them, feed them to the children, forget them, forget them, forget them, I will finish your Lords.”
An advertising that was published on the company's Facebook website has created large online controversy.
The film currently has 77 000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many claim that it is inappropriate to joke about “the horror of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give a bullock, except that their children are received after several days of birth,\" he wrote one of the users.
Elvie Lactator can be considered under feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both mother and child.
Of course, let's use the cows to advertise lactating mothers that can stop their children -
Someone else added: “This advertising is completely disfellowshipped from reality.
Another weapon of a clip, one woman said that her song was “playable, ” she said.
“I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one of these.
I felt like a cow when I was draining food.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I'm not looking for another bottom of it.
It's a brilliant invention-- someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny ad directed to mothers who take food (partly at work or toilet) and feel like a ‘knit’.
It is not intended to praise or criticise the dairy industry.
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lentilators with discreetly attached breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many feeding women feel like cows.
The Elvie Lactator is absolutely quiet, there are no cables or pipes and you can carry it unnoticed under a feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their children on their hands, and even get out of the house while taking food.
Ana Balarin, a creative partner and director at Mother, said: “Elavie Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and provocative premiere.
When we set up women and dairy cows with each other, we wanted to show all the challenges that are linked to the withdrawal of food, presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that he provides.
It's not the first time Elvie's lactator was on the front of the newspaper.
During the London Fashion Week, during the Marty James show, the mother of two children with the same product appeared on the run.
Hundreds of children of immigrants were secretly transferred to the tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of prisoners held is increasing rapidly, although the number of persons crossing the border does not change properly every month. This is due partly to the fact that the strict rhetoric and the principles introduced by President Trumpa's administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they report for the child.
Such risks have increased in June when the federal authorities have announced that fingerprints will be collected from potential sponsors and other adults living in the common holding, which will then be transmitted to immigration offices.
Last week, the senior official at the Immimmigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who were sponsored for children who were left without custody.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests were not previously recorded.
“A small 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal history.
That is why we pursue them constantly,” Albence said.
The shelter workers say that in their efforts to accelerate the regulation of the situation of the officials, some of them require that they appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as is the case according to previous standards.
Many will be put through videoconference and not personally to ask the judge of immigration to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to aggression or escape attempts.
The defenses found that these problems were even more serious in the case of larger centres such as Tornillo, where due to its size, it is easier to overlook the signals that something bad is happening with the child.
They also added that the transfer of children to the tent camp without providing them with adequate time to prepare emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can increase the trauma with which many of them are already struggling.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish ‘occupants' forces to withdraw immediately
During his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moual, also called for refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in the country lasts eight years.
He also said that foreign forces are illegally present in the Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “let us deal with them properly,” said Moual.
‘They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,’ said the Assembly.
I was able to say that “the war with terrorism was almost over, in Syria, where more than 35,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “have led his holy battle until the territory of Syria has been cleaned, both from terrorist groups and from “all foreign nationals staying illegally on it,” he says.
Today, around 2000 American soldiers are stationed in Syria, who are primarily involved in the training of the Kurdic forces and Syrians against President Bashar al-Assad and counseling them.
Besides, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the country destroyed by war.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moual said that the conditions are good enough to return, and accused “some Western countries,“ to raise irregular fear - that discourages them to return.
\"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to help these returns\", he said.
“They have political issues that should have a purely human dimension.
The United States and the European Union have warned that until the President of Assad has concluded a political agreement with a view to the end of the war, Syria will not receive any help to rebuild.
The United Nations Diplomacy says that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large bastion of rebels in Idlib created the possibility of continuing political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent the great attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province of three million people.
However, Moual stressed that the agreement had “a clear time frame,” and expressed his hope that the military action would be measured in the jihadists, including fighters associated with the Al-Kaid Front of the Lionant People’s Defense Council, who would be “deliberated”,
The UN messenger, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon launch the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the governing and opposition to develop a sketch of the postwar constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
Moual stressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the Panel's work should be limited to “to verify the provisions of the current Constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for second term in 2020 unless, assumably, many liberal observers hope, his presidency will end with an office and scandal earlier.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far,”
So far, there are no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings in the first place doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and the MSNBC channel almost tripled, up to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average, it attracts 2.4 million viewers in the most visible hours, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC program “The Rachel Maddow Show” reached the highest score among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening information programs.
“ People fly like moths to fire,” said Neal Bear, the main producer of the ABC “Designed Rawivor” series, about the secretary of the cabinet, who became president after the attack on the Chapter.
Nell Skovell, an experienced comedy artist and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And and Few Hard Truths About Sneacking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She mentioned she was driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trumpa.
“Why,” she asked.
“He makes me laugh, ” he replied.
‘Chaos has a entertainment value;
Of course, reports from Washington could be like nothing else shown on TV to go over the future of the Roe v. Wade case, about the acceptability of combining immigrants or the state of the world economy.
Excluding is a luxury that only most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it is not only about being well informed to the citizen when you are watching the sixth hour of the panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward with secret informants when writing the book “Fear” about Paul Manafort's jacket from the skin of the suffocation for $15,000 (the clothing loaded with pride, as stated by The Washington Post) or about the application of the details of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Storm Daniels.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again.
“What he does, partly resembles the reality show in this respect, that every evening he provides new content,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars”, about the changing use and daily return of the show Trumpa (as an attack on the NFL league players or the glory of Kim Dong Una).
You can't afford to miss a episode because you're going to have a backlog.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where it had its home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle, watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just before the Senate Tribunal Commission and considered the future of the Supreme Court.
\"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said, 'this is the beginning of Western civilization',\" Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out that they were right.

The flow of money from outside for the election campaign to Congress
It's not surprising that after reorganising the constituency, the one position in the race is now two current congressmen to the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania, a river of cash flows.
This recently created suburban district Pittsburgh represents a representative of Democrats in Congress, Conor Lamb, who received his seat in another district during the special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new district 17.
The district maps were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were determined unfairly, which gave the advantage to the Republican and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district of 17. began the fight against the fight against the financing of the campaign between the main authorities for the financing of the party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamba's name was popular in Pennsylvania after a long-term Italian winner in a wide-ranging election to the 18th electoral district held in March.
The Republican has been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Policy experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but they have withdrawn this idea.
Diplomacy noted that Dominican and Panama have already identified Beijing, despite a slight opposition to Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the partner of Trump Organization's management team had a hotel in Panama.
The authorities of the State Department have decided to withdraw the Heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to cease the recognition of Taiwan”, as said in her statement this month, the spokesperson of the department, Heather Nauert.
However, the sanctions considered were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received $140 million assistance from the United States, among other things, to combat drugs and to support development and economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to limit financial assistance and grant visas to certain persons, would be very vulnerable to this Central American country, which is faced with large unemployment and a high murder rate.
In the course of the progress of the meetings of the North and Central American officials, a high-level conference was held to address the conclusions of the similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from leaving the United States.
In the middle of September, top-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus reducing any consideration of the sanctions against El Salvador.
Displomacation says that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, the Vice President Mike Pence is expected to have a signal showing the invitation to the assembly of representatives of the administration.
Three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominicans, and there were no new strict messages or penalties from Washington.
The Ombudsman, John Bolton of the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal pertactations on anonymity.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst in the administration area, which was also anonymously spoken.
Learn History
Another element can be the report by the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstacles to justice by President Trump's action, which is now specific evidence available publicly.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump's campaign had something to do with Russia's attack on American elections.
If he changes the membership of Congress, President Trump will be held responsible during the preparations for the re-election of the voters, and he may even be judged before the jury.
There are many unconscious people here, and I do not want to suggest that Trumpa’s fall - nor people in equivalent positions in Europe - is inevitable.
We all need to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic which will decide how long it may take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out the coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History circles turn around such feedback points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable risk of democracy.
There are now several such feedback points in front of the Americans.
What do we do if Donald Trump releases Attorney General Rosenstein, the man who depends on Robert Mueller's future investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed that last year he proposed a mysterious recording of the president and was speculating that he was not suitable for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by the Times is incomplete.
“How do we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation concerning Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed as Judge of the Supreme Court in spite of reliable accusations on sexual assault and false testimony?
First of all, do we, in the middle of the presidential term, choose people who will be responsible for Donald Trump in Congress?
If we don't get through these trials, we'll have a tough time for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a literary Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my residence as Ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the sabasic candles on that table marked with a snack.
Having such heritage as I could not look in the future optimisticly -

Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for the game with the Rapid Vienna team
Rangers are taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday with awareness that winning with Austrians after an impressive draw with Villareal this month in Spain will significantly increase their chances of qualifying with the G League of Europe.
Until remission 2:2 of Villareal knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on Rangers as a trampoline to greater success.
“It was good for us because Villarreal is in good shape, ” said 31-year-old.
\"We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something - and set a point.
Perhaps at the end we could still press them, but overall the draw is probably a righteous result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second place we were better.
As for Thursday, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has won a good score in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will go through and this and we will fight a positive result.
The last year was definitely hard because of everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good at our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed -
Fear of pension savings spends a dream on women with eyelids
Even though the people involved in the survey knew exactly how they wanted them to be handled, few were talking about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants stated that she had spoken to her spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“ People want to take care of them as a family member, but do not talk about them,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationvideo selling life insurance.
Where to begin?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not express your will.
With an advisor and family, talk about where and how you want them to look after you, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from the financial advisor: he may help to find a way to pay the expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that enables you to pay cash to cover such expenditure or from your own assets, if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent judicial bats from doing so.
He will appoint a trusted healthcare officer who will oversee it and ensure that appropriate persons proceed in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of a Agent who will take care of finances.
Choose a trusted person because she will take your financial decisions and make sure all the bills are paid if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the details: Imagine your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and he's going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergy?
Write yourself all the information to have them prepared.
“This is not just about finances, but about who doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What kind of drugs are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It is worth having such a plan under hand -

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the cancelled communication, there was no information from the Doggala cabuppatene, which was located north of the Palu, closer to the earthquake epicentration of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the crash with Palu.
Here are some of the most important information about Palu and the Doggala cabupata on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the Mediterranean Celebes province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates, 379 800 people lived in 2017.
When the earthquake and the tsunami occurred, the 40th anniversary of its establishment was held in the city.
Donggala is a cabupathene (a administrative unit with a level below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island at a length of more than 300 km.
It is estimated that 299 200 people lived in 2017.
The main branches of the Middle Sea economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed particularly in the coast of Donggala.
Another source of province income is nickel mines, but they are mainly in Morali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Disposal of the Catastrophic Scouts in the last 100 years of earthquakes and tsunami, they visited the Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in the western Donggali.
Indonesia is on an active seismically pacific ring of fire, which makes earthquakes happen there regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: The large earthquake, which visited the western coast of Aceh in the north of Suumatra on December 26, caused the tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Suumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Suumatra.
2006: In the south of Japan, the most populated island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6,8 degrees, causing the tsunami that fell into the south coast by killing almost 700 people.
2009: Not far from Padang, the capital of Western Suumatra, there was an earthquake of 7,6 degrees.
More than 1100 people died as a result of it.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai islands near the Suumatra coast. It caused a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: Earthquakes hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who continued to remember the destruction that was fatal in the effects of the 2004 earthquake and the tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami wave, but the rolling buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing over 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of houses and brought temporary problems to thousands of tourists.

Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for a suspect in New York terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors from New York demand death penalty for Sayfull Saipova suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in eight people killed. It is a rare punishment - has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack that took place in October on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental truck Home Depot, which was driving pedestrians and bikers on his way.
According to the notification submitted in the Southern District of New York, in order to justify its need, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “total” killed eight victims and “totally caused serious injury to the body.
According to the court document for both of these charges, the death penalty is at risk.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal court presented Saipov an action on 22 positions, including eight murder charges in the context of illegal activities, which is usually the procedure applied by federal prosecutors in criminal matters concerning organised crime, and allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required “solid planning and reflection,” the way Saipov carried it out, referred it to as“potential, cruel and immoral”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendosis and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca - states the notification of intent.
Five of the victims were the citizens of Argentina who stayed in New York tourism.
Last time there was a death penalty in New York South District ten years ago.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was carried out in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were considered guilty of conspiracy and espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court papers, which came from Ubzekistan, within months of the attack, there was no loss of conscience.
The police say he told the investigator that he felt good about what he did.
According to the Saipov file, he told the authorities that he inspired him to attack the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, the flag of ISIS in his hospital room was also demanded.
The 22 allegation file corresponds to the fact that he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipova, said that they were “for obvious reasons disappointed with the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of an earlier exemption after the release of guilt will only extend to the suffering that these events have brought to all the persons concerned,” he said.
Saipova's team of defenders asked prosecutors not to demand death penalty.
The Parliamentary of the Tory arm says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today’s protest, during the tour conference, Nigel Farage was vowing to “mobilize the army of the people, ”
Former leader of the United Kingdom’s Independent Party (UKIP) said that politicians had to “have to feel hot, beating eurosceptics when one of the parliamentarians Theresa May suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Desputed from the conservative arm, Peter Bone, said to the demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage were Secretary for Brexit, “The united Kingdom would be outside the Union already“
However, the addition of tories opting for staying in a separate protest against Brexit, held in the city, even more stressed the weight of the task of reconciling its deep divided ranks before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is difficult to achieve its plan of compromise with Chequers among the supporters of Brexit, his opponents, as well as the European Union itself.
In spite of opposition, its allies claim that it will seek to conclude agreements with Brussels and the forced Eurosceptics and laturrastists to make a choice between its proposal and “chaos”
Peter Bone said to the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to “get the plan out of Chequers”
He suggested that the attorney should be Nigel Farage, who should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he did this, we would now be outside the Union,\" he said.
Deputed from Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we need to throw the plan out of Chequers.
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought for this in world wars to be subject to one now.
We want to constitute our rights in our own country -
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens changed their opinion from the 2016 vote: “I think the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the Union is completely incorrect;
The demonstration was also supported by Brexit Andrea Jenkyns from a lot of torys who told reporters: “I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not pleased with the general support, the opposition will not vote on it, our party, or our activists, who have made the streets and who have chosen us, neither do they support it.
Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening.
She added: “Perometers keep their positions when they receive promises, ” she said.
Nigel Farage stated that politicians involved in demonstrations had to “have a hot sense if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
\"Now this is a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class -\" he said.
“They try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them”, we will not let you do it.”
He added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the edge of Brexit’s betrayal feel warm.
“We have the army of the people of this country that has given us victory in a referendum on Brexia, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.
At that time, the opponents of Brexit were marching through the city to the center, where two hours of demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved the banners “Torys against Brexit” after the group was formed this weekend.
The Activist Lantourists, Baron Andrew Adonis, mocked conservatives for security issues at the beginning of the conference.
“These are people who claim to organize information systems and all technology to operate the Canada Plus Plan, the liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
\"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit,” he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after commanding the team enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified himself to Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' command will have a great impact on the result of the race.
The Bottas that started from the first field began very well and almost defeated Hamilton by defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettela to attack his team mate.
Vettel went to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to go in the tail of the peleton, which should decide about the fates of the race.
Mercedes's expert went to box in the next round and came to Vettel, but after a round of action, in which the Ferrari driver suddenly left the inner part of the track, risking to push to the defense after the double movement of the rival to defend the position on the third turn, Hamilton went out to drive.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the stake and at the end of his 21st birthday, he was in the seventh place.
Then the big part of the race led to the fact that he did not change tires to perform a quick finish and take up Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
After all, he went to service point 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps, he couldn't hurry.
“It was a tough day, because Valteri was doing a great job all weekend and turned out to be a gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team has given itself everything to take two first places,” said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body talk.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump made a joke with Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed that she did not disclose the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused her of being nominated at Judge's Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Justice Senate Commission. Instead, he concluded that what had happened in the Senate showed that people were “associated, wicked and lying”
“What may have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for several days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, flooded, wicked and lying,” he said.
\"We see what was published and revealed, and then they say to us, \"Oh, I didn't do it.\"
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the contents of this document?
Oh, no.
I did not disclose it.
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we did not reveal-- he added, presumptuous senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford with a statement of charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his contents were leaking at the beginning of September.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s innuenction, I did not reveal her history,” Feinstein testified before the committee, as the newspaper The Hill reports.
“She asked me for discretion, and I did not disclose these content in line with her request.
However, her statement did not convince the president who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, that was a really bad speech of the body.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst speech I've ever seen in my life.
By continuing to defend the candidate at the Supreme Court Judge whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats use innuenctions for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over all means.
You can see the indignation, impregnity, they do not care who they harm, who they must destroy, to take over power and control,” said the president according to the mediaite reports.

Analityist rebuilt events from the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor ended the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for many hours as a judicial officer in the field of information analysis.

As the Clarion Ledger newspaper reports, Rowlett said he received the location data from various cell phones, which showed that Tellis had been with Chambers infernal evening.
When the data confirmed that at the time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friends Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.

Nanny from New York is suing a couple for the release of “rasist” - SMS
Nanny from New York is suing a couple to release her from work on a racist background after receiving a misdemeanored SMS, in which the mother of the child complains that she is “a different black person.
A couple contradicts them as though they were racists, comparing the claim to “manufacturing, ”
Two children's mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly confronted when it turned out that the new guardian, Giselle Maurice, who was engulfed for the first day of her work in 2016, is a witch.
“NIEEE, KOLJENNA CZARNA OSOBODA”, wrote in text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to the news of the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that she had a committed gaff, “worried,” she released Gisella Maurice, claiming that a heartful nanny, who was African-American, was misheard of her duties, and besides expected a nanny from the Philippines.
Madam Maurice was paid for her day's work, and then she was sent home to Uber.
Now, he demands a couple of compensations for an exemption of 350 dollars a day multiplied by six months for which she was originally hired to live, although she did not sign a contract.
“I want to show them that they do not do such things,” said the newspaper Post on Friday and added, “I know that this is discrimination.
The couple backs up allegations about racism, claiming that the conclusion of cooperation with Mrs Maurice was justified, because after they insulted her, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
“ My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to talk to.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” said Postman Joel Plasco.
“ Would you tell your children to the person you felt sorry for even if it happened by mistake?
Your newly born child?
Come on.
Compared to the “genuine ” case, Plasco said that his wife had been born only two months earlier and was in “very difficult situation.
\"Do you want to blow something like this?
This is not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the case has not yet ended in court, the public opinion has quickly issued a few judgments in social media, criticizing it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the book about the Stemton were afraid that readers would not have a connection with the talking bear.
The daughter of the author, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after a warm adoption of the book, says: “It is hard to stand on the place of the person who read it for the first time, before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about the great success of Pivetton--
He claims that her father, who, before a small plus bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a camera player at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year’s 60th anniversary of the release of the book seems to be “the sweet-gogorka”
As described as the “very important member of our family, ” he says that her father was proud of his success in secret.
“He was a silent man, he did not boast,” he adds.
“However, since Pvedton seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something, you feel proud of him, although it was not your merit.
I think the success of Pidton has seen in a little more than that.
Although he invented it himself and created it, he always deserved it to Pvesteron himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“He called regularly and said that it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t work out,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“He called to say that Natasha will die within two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tash, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart action slowly stopped acting and were excreted in the body.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit there and wait for them to know it's all growing up.
I couldn't even scream or cry because I was with other people.
I had to really stick to it.
In the end, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already crying out for her daughter's loss, came aboard with other passengers who were unconscious about the torture she had passed through.
“No one knew,” she said.
My head was off, and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all sorts of compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.

Bretta Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italian because the FBI is going to investigate.
“I thought that if we could actually get what he asked us to do, an investigation of limited time and limited scope, perhaps we could achieve some unanimity,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that “the commission would fall apart on opposite camps, leading to an impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want an FBI investigation?
They're all out of time.
The elections to Congress are already in a few weeks - 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a certain person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush had already raised his listener to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House, and because of him he met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary of president.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
In the Senate currently holding 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, the vote will be held.
It is not certain whether Brett Kavanaugh will obtain at least 50 votes of senators, which would allow the Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's governments, the number of escapeers from North Korea is decreasing.
According to the South Korean legislator since seven years ago, Kim Dong Un took over the power, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South.
By citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 escapes were recorded last year and in 2011 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more accurate border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human smugglers.
Pjongjang did not make a public statement on this issue.
The vast majority of North Korea escapeers is ultimately proposed for South Korea citizenship.
According to the authorities in Seoul since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans from the North crossed the border illegally.
Most of them run through China, which have the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross it than a strictly protected demiliary zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China considers escapeers to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to their country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still in the state of war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongyang, where they held talks about the negotiations on denucerisation which had previously been in a dead place.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dong Un, which took place in Singapore in June. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on seeking to clear the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of America of no progress on this issue.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security and there is no possibility that we should unilaterally defend ourselves as the first one,” said Ri in the speech which he made before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hissteryk” and claims that he is not fit for work at the Supreme Court
A minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh “hissteryk” and said that he was naturally not fit for work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these words during her interview, which she gave on Saturday during Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think that if a woman acted this way, she would be considered as a hysterical”,” said Pelosi of his response to the testimony that Kavanaugh had made on Thursday before the Justice Senate Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the alleged sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his preliminary speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions, almost screaming and losing his speech when he discussed family and high school issues.
He also made it clear to the Democrats from the committee, stating that the “grotesque and coordinated coup on the reputation” organised by the liberals, the angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that it was not suitable for work at the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
“I think he was disqualifying himself by issuing these statements, as well as by the way that he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Asked whether she would try to cancel Kavanaugh from the office if he had received a nomination and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“I say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also official in that court where he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrats she was afraid of the possible judgments of Kavanaugh on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade process, because he was considered conservative judge.
During the hearing of Kavanaugh, he left questions about whether he would fail certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
\"This is not the time for the introduction into the hysterical court of the preceding person who will expect us to say 'and how wonderful it is',\" Pelosi added.
And women have to put her in.
It's the right dial, the months and the years of the spilling fur, and she can't throw it out of her face without crying.
“We pay when we are angry,” Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
\"It seems quite common, isn't it?
She added: “a woman who was the manager of a company has greatly helped me. She said that she also crys when she's angry, but she figured out a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she says to the person she talks to, “You think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.
The tears are allowed as an act of anger in part because they are actually misplaced.
One of my obvious memories from one of the first positions in an office dominated by men is how I once started crying out of inexhaustible rage. A certain older woman is a cool manager, whom I always felt a little afraid of.
“ Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“ They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy that they've taken care of you.
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, now deputated to Congress with Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrawn from a race, frustrated to the boundaries of Patricia realized that he might properly consider the idea of self-preservation for the president.
“It was not a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“For the elections seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone has identified this situation as 'The Short Snow and the Seven Creatures'--
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder has had a long time to come up with a fund collection and promised herself she wouldn't race if she hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a prisoner's battle for a loser.
She discovered that some of her followers who gave the men $1000 had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts, ” she wondered.
During the speech in which she declared that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration because of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to turn to voters, not delegates, and anger to sexism - that the voice had taken it in her throat.
“It may think that I have experienced a nervous breakdown,” recalls the reaction of the press.
\"It may be possible to think that Kleenex sponsors me.
I remember wondering what they were gonna write on my tombstone.
'She cried? '
What benefits Beijing’s economic war can bring between the United States and China
The halls starting the US-China economic war were deafening, and although the battle is still ongoing, in the long term the conflict between these countries could be beneficial for Beijing, they say experts.
The first warning shot the President of the United States this year, Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariff rates on goods worth USD 200 billion ($150 billion), resulting in taxation of half of all goods arriving in the USA from China.
Every time Beijing turned into nature, bringing recent customs duties on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US strike, and it does not look like the second economy in the world is about to cease.
Washington's forced to withdraw is to accept demands, but the public inclination of the head before the United States would be too embarrassing for China President Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays well with its cards, the pressure of the US trade war could in long term strengthen China by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
\"The fact that the rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the expansion of economic chaos in one country is actually far more dangerous than they have already granted observers,\" said Abigail Grace, a researcher in the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is “prepared to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and asks for help in rebuilding the country destroyed by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, stated that the conditions in the country improve.
“The situation in our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
In order to restore normality, the government will rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All conditions have already been fulfilled so that refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral shifts of their daily lives and means of maintenance can freely return to it.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would be delighted to receive help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the aid granted by the countries who sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seales the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.

Dustin Johnson, who has the highest position in global ranking, has lost two holes before the last time with Anglik Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The Europeans with the greatest number of winnings in Ryder Cup was Spain Sergio Garcia, who had already participated in eight such tournaments and gained 25,5 points of career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I'm so glad to get my gun back.
This is the success of the entire team, and I am pleased that I could help,\" said Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He is handing over the band to his native, John Rahm, who was defeated on Sunday in a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, with a result of 2&1.
\"I feel an amazing pride with Tiger Woods winning. I grew up watching his game,\" said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost all the games in France, and now he has the 13-21-3 score at Ryder Cup.
This is an unusual statistics, like one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and resolved only to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had problems finding the treadmill all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointmenting performance of the American composition of his captain Jim Furik, he said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning we pressed some Europeans.
We're back.
Headcaps in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will change the composition of the group. Together with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us.
