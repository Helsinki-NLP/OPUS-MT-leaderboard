Black box in your car?
While American road designers are working hard to find money for repairing the remote network, many are beginning to see solutions in a small black box that easily enters the instrument board of your car.
The devices that follow every mile, which the motorist is going to run, and which transmit this information to the authorities are the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and State Planning Offices to renew the outdated system of financing US major roads.
Usually, the rational design of highways suddenly stimulated intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of ecologists and lobbyed for the government to use these little lockers that would record a few kilometers, and maybe even where you drive, and then would use this information to build a tax measure.
The team's agitated.
The US Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of issues with privacy protection.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states do not expect anything.
They shall find out how they can move to the system in which the driver pays for miles of the road after which he goes.
Thousands of motorists already have black boxes, some of which have GPS surveillance, took to test.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It is not a matter where we can choose too much,” said Hasan Ikhrata, the Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration, who plans to start tracking the kilometres of all Californian motorists in 2025.
It will change the way we pay these taxes.
This is what this technology is doing.
The fact is that the road trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations is on the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars drive a lot more kilometres into one gallon.
Federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are shortening their tax by just one cent.
“The gas station is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munchi, an expert in transport policy from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
\"In the long term, it appears to be the most logical alternative,\" he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of lost kilometres.
It is no surprise that this idea likes urban liberals because taxes can be used to change the patterns of driver behaviour, such as helping to reduce traffic jams and create greenhouse gases.
Californian designers are looking at this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representation of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Committee on Transport, said that he also sees this as the most functional long-term alternative.
Representatives of the free market from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for a mile away.
“It is not a tax that disappears in the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president for the Reason strategy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative also supports two former American transport ministers who invited Congress in 2011 to go towards paying per km.
The American Senate approved the 90 million USD pilot project last year, which was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of the rural legislators representing the populations whose daily life often means to take many kilometres away from the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, who included 5,000 drivers in the biggest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the tax for a mile away instead of a gas tax.
The unsub has already completed the pilot project.
New York's researching the project right now.
Illinois is trying to make this a limited deal with freight wagons.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministers, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) study how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have a supporter.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were equipped recently, drivers were concerned about the fact that the government was able to watch every move of them.
“The concerns regarding the follow-up of Big Brother and similar matters were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who led the management of the strategy and operation at the New York Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-time tracking equipment.
There is no need to build a massive heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to daily exit records and arrivals of individuals.
There are several states that are trying to find technology that would enable the state to monitor how many kilometres the car will find, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hon brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance).
This company was initially not involved in the action to help the government when taxing drivers.
She wanted to go to a emerging legal insurance market where the drivers would pay on the basis of how much the issue.
But this device that tests attracts attention to road designers because it does not use GPS and adds only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“ People will be more willing to do so if you do not follow their speed and position,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been many major mistakes in some of these pilot programs.
They're a lot cheaper and less interesting ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can select GPS or GPS devices.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of miles away from all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that a prudent public will come to this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to make it possible to pay charges for parking hours to provide insurance according to the lost kilometres and to collect data on the speed of other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to engage in it because of the benefits they offer,” says the city’s project document.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about payment per mile are not just a circumstantial problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Committee on Transport in the San Francisco Bay say that Congress could easily solve the problem with the Banked Road Trust Fund by increasing gas tax.
Single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid drivers or other vehicles which do not need much fuel, so they will pay fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery, when richly enough to marry aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Head of the Committee on Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Sobotka's negotiating for ČSSD.
Social democracy is accommodating, people and grandmothers speak together, and they're planning a common approach.
If social Democrats fail within a few weeks, they will sit on the table with perfectly coordinated partners who will put on the table a complete list of requirements including the Ministerial Posts.
Members of the USSD then either swallow the acidic coalition threat, or they go to the drilling minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka after four days, when he carried himself on a wave of sympathy, he first encountered.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political empire and mainly force the convicted liars to resign.
The successful tenderer is only on the side, and the other members of the team will be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (VVC).
I apologized to the members of the game and now to the citizens.
He's not lying, he's not in his personal life or in public.
“It was a mistake,” said Michal Hašek, after the discussion of the most important social democracy.
He added that he didn't lie at the post of the first Vice-President.
“I will make my decision on 10 November at the UV,” Hašek said.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdeněk Šcromach and Chief of the Jerusalem Tejc Group spoke as well.
But he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
The two Members then stated that they would do everything to make the 50-member ČSSD club sound like one voice.
Michael Hašek put the Absurdic Theatre in the line: “I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her mark and have respected the decision of the parties to the authorities.
They were making another lie in direct transmission.
Or did the invitation to Saturday's resignation and its removal from the negotiating team forget that the August ÚVV dropped 57 percent on Bohuslav Sobotka as the candidate for the Prime Minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, made a powerful army of enemies on the next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the 192 members of this organ and the media of various vibrations and fem, eventually reminiscing the real mistakes of Sobotkov's political career.
It will be powerful to wash dirty linens, the signs of dark alliances between the discolored Zdenek Bakal and Sobotka wings appear.
It will discuss a friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the powerful attorney Radka Pokorny.
They're building disputes in South Moravia or the Moravian organisation of the ČSSD.
The words of the Australian Mayor and Saturday’s ally Peter Kajnar: ‘Chart 77 I signed so that the country doesn’t find idiots.
If the UV had already met this weekend, liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
Traitors will put their head down with ashes and stay.
And right now the winner boss of the ČSSD will end up with a nickname called Bohuslav Pyrha.
Martin Doctor about OH problems in Sochi: Communication with Russia is difficult
The birds of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he will just take a deep breath: ‘It’s challenging. ’
Cooperation with the organizational team of the Olympics in Sochi 2014 is a little more complicated according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what was in the previous Olympics.
The head of the Czech Olympic Mission says nothing works the same.
What, specifically, is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of providing information on essential matters.
Maybe we've been searching for three months to add, as we're officially marked by individual villages, so that we can do a whole lot of things, according to that.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying that things are communicating.
They keep communicating in a number of things.
Is there at least an Olympic village already built?
But it's not a disaster anymore.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Is there need to be finished floors?
Just the basic concrete, so that was the state of the month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that until January 26 as a foreman, there will still be a feeling of glue.
And if they don't, what's going to happen?
President Putin would have put an army there?
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
Just so it wasn't that the Olympic village = the obsession of the village.
They are more likely to fail, for example, the adjustments to the journeys, do not give details.
Maybe they'll have ways in such a state that we're going to have to take the hollies out of London's games.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now it's about 78, even though the number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
I mean, if you're gonna be a loser, they'll probably be on their way in the threesome that they went out.
Also, no one has to doubt about the fast brawls of Martin Sablí, but otherwise it's in development.
Still waiting for you to go to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should go there until January 26.
How the houses in the Olympic Village will look, we know.
We even measured some things by metro, so we don't just believe in sketches.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transport.
And what's the mission boss doing 100 days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus making a common agenda in communication with the Sochi Organising Committee.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, the plan of the giant secret dumps.
Winter sports fans are already shooting meters to start Olympic games in Sochi, others are looking for their preparation with increasing fear.
Russian Olympiad, if it starts in February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians seem not to be able to fulfill the promise that the preparation and the performance of the games will not in the least disrupt nature in the Krasnodar Region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be headed in four months.
Finally, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high, Canadian game built into the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organise games with “zero waste” - has taken a long time behind his own.
Reporters of the AP have discovered a giant wall of building material in the village of Ahštyr near Sochi last week.
So the dump full of building material, tyres, canisters and insulation foams found in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have gone away and the dump is gone.
Only for a while.
Last week, the reporters had a look at the dump about the size of three football courses.
He is not the only one, in such places there were several, described the British letter The Times.
There are Russian railways, state monopolies, which builds about 60-inch route between Sochi Airport and Sport resort.
A business that has already caught 280 billion rubles has led one of the close Putin colleagues of Vladimir Jakuunin.
In August, the railroads defended that the dump was founded by someone from the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Ahštyr, three months of the village and nights have been driving trucks full of waste material.
Experts say that waste is contaminated by the local River of Mymita, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
“The water from here contaminates the Soviet water springs over the next ten to fifteen years,” said Vladimir Kimaev from the environmental non-profit organization EWNC.
Illegal dumps are not the only problem with the Russian Organising Committee and the Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
Compared to comparison, the games in Sochi will cost $1 51 billion while summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 went out to 43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project detentions and concerns, if at last there will be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights do not comply with human rights while working on an exhibition of sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers took his mouth to protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers during the games deal with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are planning to support Russian gays on the Olympics.
Young couple matured with parents, a new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates received as an assignment to suggest a house on a parcel, which lies on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is somewhat considered.
In addition, it was necessary that there would be two generations in the house that would want to live together, but everyone should have their own clearly separated space.
Younger couple needed an extra office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly stretching property.
The architects decided to put each household in one of the floors of the house.
“In the design we respected family associations, history and memories associated with the place.
The three different functions of the house are several paths connected through the exterior of the building, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their privacy,” explains the designers.
Parenthood is at the level of garden with an old pine tree with family traditions and memories.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognized from the outside, namely, different final fasad adjustment.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been drawn with panels from the boards, the part where the office is, is cast white and remaining elements remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glassed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected with the exterior.
Parenthood, more specifically the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that has great significance for the family.
The interconnection of the interior with the exterior undermines the side wall, which starts at the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance into the hall and then rises up the stairs to their spaces.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their construction allows them to experience a lot of natural light.
That's why architects tried to distinguish the house from others and print it something unique.
The home of a young couple is discussed as one open space with kitchen parts, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace, it only divides a glass wall with a sliding door.
Living zone with dining and kitchen parts in the house of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where it is a nice view of the Tokyo bay.
The office itself at the highest floor is captured in a clean combination of white and black colors.
The stairs are a dominant element in the interior of the house.

Defend academic freedom, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly called for open letters of students, teachers and leaders of secondary and university schools in several countries in recent months to defend academic freedoms against the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at schools.
I met with greater or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to lecture the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovce in the pre-election period, even received a withdrawal in the form of a non-committee for the celebration of the Czech Republic's national holiday.
Here is a list of school leaders who have not been so brave and visited by Miloš Zeman: High technical education in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov, Ostrava, University of Commerce in Ostrava, University of J.E. Purky in Ústě nad Labem.
We now meet in Pardubica with the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
The newly elected Member for ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Perdubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to withdraw from his academic function and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's not really the same as if you're staying in the mayor of a smaller town.
Do you want to go to the ČSSD captains, who are also degrading the function of the Members and the captains, as well as degrading both professions?
Because you tell people that they can handle both these demanding rear left functions.
I know, we have an example of Michal Haska, who manages even several dozen functions at once.
But I don't think that's exactly an example of someone you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who prefers to leave the mission post so that the management of the town of Pardubice can be fully engaged.
However, the main reason for my recommendation is to leave the dean's function is that you will break the apolity of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
Paradubic command ODS sees your current effect on both posts as an advantage to the University.
“But you will be able to help your school without being a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion like me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
Consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that your voters will count on the next election.
And that doesn't have to have a long duration.
In the Kunovice, the blue greens don't add chemistry to it.
More than a thousand tons of sour greens in the coming months want to produce in the Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
Season started here in October, and it will last about six months.
Since 1925, he has been producing a traditional way of walking right in big dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our employee found nearly a 10-mile route behind the shift.
In each of the ten tanks there are 15 to thirty tons of greens, the filling takes one three shifts,” said the director of the plant Slováková Fruta David Kladroba.
Of its own fields of farmers mostly from Ostrožska and Břeclavska are imported into the premises of the company.
Employees of Fruty then vegetables clean up, remove the baskets and throw them in a circle.
From there, the already cut green falls into pools of six-meter depths, where we work tirelessly with hookers dressed in white clothes and shavings.
That's how they wipe off the unwanted air.
The last fallen layer of the green is covered with a sail and strains the water.
‘The green crougna then matures six to eight weeks after spontaneous milking without any addition of substances supporting acidation,” said Director Kladab.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers of workers spill salt and cumin.
The green after the acidation pushes to the filling line.
Packed in a sweet, sugary soup into bags or glass and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sour greens mainly on the domestic and Slovak market.
The interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “work with Germany in relation to the US monitoring
Edward Snowden, a rat from American intelligence services, announced that he was willing to leave Berlin to give evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander were not able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
The German Member of Hans-Christian Sträbel met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and acted with him on the opportunity to testify in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who submitted to the media on Friday in Berlin: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to act as a result of the opposition and is seeking to criminalise political expressions with heavy complaints that do not give the area for defence -
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter Mr Snowden said that he believed that the promotion of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to withdraw the charges against him.
The charges raised by the U.S. Justice Department include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of Interior, said for Zeit Online magazine: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to enable this to happen.
The tension between the US and Germany began to rise when the claims that the NSA was listening to Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the parliament, who is in charge of the intelligence, said that if any opportunity had been to question Mr Snowden as a witness, “without being in danger, and that the relationship with the US would have completely destroyed, it should be done.
Mr Sträbel, MEP behind the German side of the Greens, published a photo on his twitter contribution to which Mr Snowden is with him.
Two German journalists accompanied him on their way to Russia.
Mr. Sträbel said that according to former contract attorney, Mr. Snowden would not be able to go back to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would “be safe there,” said a member of Parliament.
Mr. Snowden in his letter said he faced a rough and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his “act of political expression,” he gave him courage.
Citizens on the whole and outright officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the detection of an unfounded system of universal monitoring for public service.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities, ‘as the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved’
Killing us sorry, but we're innocent, we're fighting with representatives of the Red Khmers.
Nuon Chea was the number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former government chief.
Over the years 1975 to 1979, under the Red Khmer government, which faced a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, they lost their lives due to exhaustion, hunger, sickness, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodia, i.e. at least a quarter of those populations.
This commander of the infamous S-21 prison awarded the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010 a life sentence.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genotoxicity and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan argued that they believed that they acted in the best interest of the nation and did not know what the real range of killing was.
“It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understand everything, and therefore intervene and correct the situation,” said Khieu Samphan before the trial on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he had never ordered Red Khmer's friends to “be mistreated people or kill them to deny them food or to smell genotypes”
But he admitted “moral responsibility - for the dead.
“I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the sacrifice, to their families, to all the Cuban people,” he said.
Five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, AFP said that she could not accept an apology from Nuon Chea.
- He lied to us -
“Only he wants to be released from guilt.
\"She doesn't care about the other one,\" she said.
“If he had not given orders, his foundation would not have killed,” she added that the leaders of the Red Khmers were worse than monsters.
He was also supposed to stand before the trial, as well as the Foreign Minister, the Red Khmer regime of Ieng Sara, who died this March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, the former Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012 the court found an incompetent process for dementia.
Leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 per delivery luggage and USD 2 per coffee or soda, although in their notification at the center they said that passengers would be able to leave a whole canopy.
The new hand luggage fee concerns luggage in the upper storage space, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says that it will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and USD 100 if the passengers with pay will wait until they reach the gate.
The spokesperson Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the stock exchange fee was to encourage passengers to make sure that they paid forward.
“We would hate to choose this fee,” she said.
Air companies started paying first and second luggage in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these charges and torched into the manual luggage stored in storage space as much as they could, so there was often no place in this space.
The fees are one of the ways to train passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the sense of this new fee really isn't getting more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming more difficult.
Travelers who buy tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier's gate can bring luggage that will not pay anything, while the other passenger in the front will pay 100 USD for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the website and the removal procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers are informed of the fee before their arrival to the gate.
The new fee of Frontier for hand luggage will not yet be valid until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travelers often complain about luggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and the passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider additional luggage charges as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of loss.
Most of them didn't hit the hand luggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and another low cost company Allegiant Air followed later.
The only company with such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his report of December 2011, he estimated that Spirit's handbag fee would bring USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when the passengers met with the unusual fee of Spirit for the handbag.
“The trip to the plane was the fastest I've ever seen in my flight career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth and fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the entrance took place in the cloud.
Frontier also applies coffee, tea, soda and juice charges after Spirit's model.
Frontier said that passengers who receive the soda or juice can keep the whole canopy and the coffee will be provided free of charge.
The water will continue to be administered free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to introduce a drink fee, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, no other significant airline had received it.
The last move of Frontier to charge hand luggage if the passenger does not buy flights directly from this airline is its last effort to direct the customers directly to its website.
Air companies pay internet travel dealers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for every ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of making it through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the farthest in this area.
In September, she began to give customers who bought over the Internet travel agency, only half a mile within the loyalty program.
In the middle, the reward for the miles loaded to 25 percent of the mile from the route.
So the trip with Frontier long 1000 miles purchased via the Internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The customer also enables the company to choose its seat in advance only if the purchase takes place directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in his hometown of Denver, but her business is beginning to stink and lose money.
According to the financial results of the mid-term partner of the Republic of Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and the traffic capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
The Republic's sales of this airline are also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
For the fall of the NSA website, it does not blame hackers, but “inward error”
The mystery National Security Agency reported last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week due to internal error, not because of the attack of hackers, as some said on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov sites were not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates,” said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by an attack by the DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
This evening, online server sensors recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the pages are still unavailable for some users.
Former NSA spokesperson of the ABC News station said that the internal sensitive networks of the Agency were not “inquisitionally threatened.
The spokesperson said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hackers on the Internet claimed that it was responsible for removing NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the page falls.
This cyber tactics is relatively simple and the sense of attacks is not to penetrate the internal target system.
In recent months, the former super-titious NSA agency, which once acquired a nickname No such agency, became after the string of the detection of foreign and domestic surveillance programmes at the centre of public attention and the target bite criticisms together the product decommissioning of classified NSA files from the Agency and their dissuadeding to the former staff of Edward Snowden.
This growing counterroad surrounded the agency's earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of targeted cyber-security operations.
The profit of Bombardier fell due to the drop in supply and orders
The Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier reported on Thursday, fifteen percent decline in net profit due to a smaller number of orders and aircraft supplies in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also published no air test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor offered up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft would receive an ambitious plan to start commercial traffic from the next September.
After the launch of the test flight about a month ago and a half the aircraft flew only three times and thus raised the question whether the test phase was well-ordered.
The results did not complete estimates and the shares at the stock exchange in Toronto decreased by 8 percent.
Cameron Doerksen’s analysis reduced its rating on Thursday from “higher profitability” to “the sector’s performance, with expectations that the storm will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
“As smaller aircraft supplies were expected to be increased, the profit margin in the field of transport has greatly disappointed us,” said Doerksen in the client report.
As the trial program continues, we believe that Bombardier will obtain new orders from the CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are notified in the coming months, we assume that the market will rise towards this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft are going to the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first testing aircraft was discovered in March and after several months of delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of mandatory CSeries aircraft orders reaches a modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and savings on the costs of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected 300 compulsory orders to reach Bombardier when putting the first aircraft into commercial use.
The managers also provided analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was followed according to the plan.
“The testing aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” said Beaudoin in the conference call and noted that testing on the ground and software updates were planned during the aircraft withdrawal.
Each producer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate first years and then focus on updates and that's what we did.
That's going to happen throughout the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of five testing aircraft would be to fly in the coming weeks and the others would not be later.
However, the analysts are sceptical about the first customer being able to start operating the CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it assessed its plan to put the aircraft into service and provided updated information in the following months.
‘This slow pace of flight tests, although in line with the internal plan of Bombardier, will probably strengthen our view that the entry into operation will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,’ said Doerksen.
From USD 172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million in the third quarter of September, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted revenue per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Obra marginally fell from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claimed that he had delivered only 45 aircraft before 57 flights during the quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the air division were 32.9 billion on 30 September, which does not change to 31 December.
“The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low income of orders and the overall state of the market has disappointed us,” said Beaudoin.
Exports in the aviation industry have fallen by 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, said that the revenue in this division increased by nearly 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Inadvertent transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion on 30 September, compared to 31 December marginal growth.
The profit margin in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The managers have noted that new views will be provided in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of the financial director Google Patrick Pichette, have decreased by 8.5 percent during trading on Thursday afternoon to USD 4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft producer and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced on Thursday, a 10-per cent drop in quarterly profits.
The lawyer is addicted to cocaine that warned the mob before the police investigation is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to give information to the king under the Bible to Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A spy lawyer who informed the drug mob about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would come out of his life, he was sentenced to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had become a suspect in cocaine use, head of the New York Bible of Neil Scarbrough to give sensitive information about his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was “Bash”, who was celebrated as the best legal representative of the criminal, was arrested at his home in 2011 following the police surveillance of Scarborough.
The police saw Sarborough (32) as he left three cocaine bags in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire.
Based on the tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were observed at that time in a major investigation of heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Following a series of raids, the police held heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million together with GBP 200 000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals in fear of coming to his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solartors law firm based in Blackburn, has experienced a shameful time in preventing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During the previous hearing, he confessed to holding cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after the Scarborough police investigation found that he was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives were watching, record his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him put the drugs on the purity of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
After that, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium at Ewood Park, in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer returned home, where the drugs were found, and there were nine interviews between the two people.
In the court, it was said that there were traces of class A drug in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards, and that Ditta was “a regular user - cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but the use of cocaine denied, and he said that he spoke to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and he argued that their conversation would fall into “trustful communication”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to pull out some credit cards, but they were all arrested and his hair samples were taken.
In police questioning, he said that he was operating an office both at his home and in the workplace, and that he was visited by clients for business.
The court, however, heard that after key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of which had previously been represented to share what the detectives knew about them.
She said: “Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than a legal representative in the criminal area,
Mr. Ditta is accused of using his legal representative's position and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own drug lawyer.
Some of his interviews were doubtless legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went way beyond the normal relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation did as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring a good reputation to his profession, and he detested it.
With certain clients, he was too close, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta refused and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer whom I am not, and I would like to give Mr Scarborough information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, the police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta himself from a legal representative in the criminal field himself became a criminal at the moment he began to get drugs from organized criminals,” he said.
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of the organised crime group, which gave him the task of gathering valuable information on police investigations.
Legal representatives must stick to the highest principles of integrity and have a confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession's poster.
The unit for serious and organised crimes in Lancashire has led to an investigation against Mr Ditt on the basis of which he was also sentenced to three cases of cocaine possession and now for the enforcement of justice, which demonstrated our commitment to bring the criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We'll find you and put you in front of our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he was declared guilty of co-operation for the purpose of adding heroin, cocaine and hemp.
Another thirty-five people involved in trading have been arrested in a total of 153 years for drug trafficking.
On Ditta's website, he organised an online conversation about himself in which he said that his dream job would be legally represented by clients from the death cell block in America, as a guest at dinner, he would like Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for his work, he said that he would be infertility.
He discussed the rule with Klaus and Spidlou.
Now the people of John Kasala have sent against Babylon.
In elections, 14 Members received only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of the ANO.
But there is at least one advantage in the negotiations on the government.
In a team that has already begun to argue the tracings of possible coalitions, Jan Kasala - a man who has placed the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrei Babiš don't have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when ODS was also a completely new party.
“The experience was at that time minimal,” explains Kasal how this year’s talks will develop.
Kenya’s press was demolished by a controversial media law
“This is a horrific report, and it is on the spot to ask what would prevent Parliament from simply removing the independence of justice tomorrow,” said the newspaper considering the draft law as anti-destructive.
“This law is strict and very repressive, and we refuse it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, to which CapitalFM belongs, one of the most respected independent radio stations and intelligence sites.
He said that the new Media Tribunal “will always be presumptuous because it is an extended hand of government, and that restrictions on content and advertising will harm Keni’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members,” he said.
According to the newspaper Star, the proposal of the law really translates “a complete control of the media” and the New York Standard states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “has been suffering from a hard wound - and criticizing the proposal of the law as “serious, ”
The approval of the draft law comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack of an Islamic shooter in Westgate shopping center.
The Chinese media turned on each other when she sent out security footage on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack reportedly robbed a luxury trade.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question, but the notice was later withdrawn after the media pressure.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be penalised to 20 million Chinese shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of “degrading from the list,” or official journalistic accreditation may be denied.
The General Court also has the right to rid the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “there is also one fine enough to destroy most radio stations,”
It is also noted that these measures may have a liquidity impact on what is called the Kenya “live blogosphere”
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do whatever they want.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote a journalist in the letter Nation Mutuma Mathia and described the Kenyan media as a key source of mutual control and balance in public life.
“When we leave it in the police, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and collection, ” he wrote.
The legislators in Kenya were in the past the target of public criticism.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of cuts directed by the national wage agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of around 532 000 unused shillings per month, which thus rank among the highest in the world.
They have to get together, they know young Czechs.
Most of them don't even know what kind of interest they're paying.
Still more Czechs put their money aside.
Yet they do not reach the champions in the rest of the region.
Most of the money is being deposited by the Rakus, who will spend a month on average of 181 euros.
More than Czechs will have to rely on people in Slovakia.
This is due to the study of Erste Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the organizers is getting better and two thirds of the questions are planning to put aside more money.
While Czechs are about in the middle of a ladder of collectors, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little products.
For example, almost every second of Serbia will have a home - under pillow - according to the survey -
In the country this year, the number of those who will spend a month with higher amounts has increased.
Last year, thousands of to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent of respondents for various types of savings were spent each month, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly component in the year-on-year comparison decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit between savings products is pension insurance.
This favors 54 percent of the Czech Republic, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings only for 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the promise of building savings falls, compared to last year, also significantly fell into interest in investment funds.
You are now using only 16 percent of respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of people.
In the survey, it was also shown that although people consider it important to count, most of them do not know what yields they achieved on individual products.
Especially young people up to 30 years don't know how their money is destroyed.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the profitability of its money is the oldest group of people over the past 50 years, that knows 73 percent of those who have been asked.
In the international comparison of Erste Češ, they lead to the use of online banking that regularly uses 44 percent of people.
They're followed by the Slovaks and the Rakus with a 12-per cent distance.
The UN celebrates new targets for fighting poverty
The United Nations is working without delay on a new set of objectives that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began at Rio de Janeiro overnight, Australian diplomats played a key role in the deployment of “continuing sustainable development goals” to replace MDGs whose validity expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ki-mun, said to the summit that it is now time to “get up above national interests.
\"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general objective of sustainable development - SDG,\" he said.
SDGs will build on the progress achieved in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and become an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to complete the mandate granted to me by the Member States and to complete our vision on the objectives of sustainable development that builds on the success of the MDG.
The concerns about the security of Mosambik are being raised because of the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samary Machely, the Mexican founder, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputa to call on the rare public demonstrations of peace passwords.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
In fear of the future, the country changed its business clothing for a shirt decorated with “We demand safety” in Portuguese and joined on Thursday to the crowd in the Square of independence in the capital.
After two weeks, reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo side were reported on one of the worst conditions from the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an invaluable rebel movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodesia and then the Government of Apartheid in South Africa under the efforts to destabilise the independent government of this country.
Following the peace agreement in 1992, the opposition party became the opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict should be reversed in the country, but recent events have led foreign investors and locals.
In the stake there is a rapidly growing economy, since the discovery of extensive coastal reserves of oil and coal bearings in the Northwest can bring more than 50 billion dollars from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko.
The Governmental Party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are accusing each other of the resulting tension.
Renamo claims that the government has created the last conflicts by starting an attack on their members in Sofal Province, the traditional Strany Renamo story.
The violent robbery of former rebels then went up when the government forces attacked the base of the Renamo party and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the group leader, said for the Financial Times spokesperson Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government's accused of launching the Renamo conflict because it says it attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuma tried to ease the instability.
Mr Guebuma for the French Press Office of AFP on Wednesday said that Mr Dhlakema saw himself as “a failure to use“ whatever he had left of his power to try to prove that he could order his own decision to the government“
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
But the concerns increased when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted, that Renamo's party is withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
FT said that by saying that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the meeting, but with seriousness,” said Mr Mazanga.
Previous conversations between these parties have made for the relief of tension between these parties, dissatisfied by a number of loops this year, little.
It is a sarvat between two great personalities (Guebuma and Dhlakema), said the tutor at the Open University and expert in Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is ready to make any necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which sought for election change, has already stated that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt to combine the movement to gain benefits from the government and financial outbursts.
Renamo's vote has been reduced since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mosambik (DM), which has been founded by former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebus, whose second term of office is next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“I want a democratic system of multiple parties, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,” said Mazanga.
It's unclear what the way Renamo's website has, but he's performed a violent terrorist attack on the police station and on the vehicle on the key road between the north and south.
Most of the attacks occurred in Sophalah Province, which, although several hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port to which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on their exports of coal.
In June, Rio stopped using railways for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to express himself to the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “variate the international community that the situation in Mosambik is not good,” said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent flooding of kidnappings.
“ People think that the country’s responsibility for the future is exclusively borne by government and president, and that he should be the one to find a solution to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuan says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want to have free access to the road,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life, ” says the author.
The stories of Thóra can show that “the thick force cannot be compared to the clever lstivity, ” while Arthur’s legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would “for teaching at school was too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases, too obscene” said Crossley-Holland, who would apply for a careful selection of works of the appropriate age.
“I think it’s great that myths and human creation are already part of education, ” he said.
I've been chasing this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly teaching“ authors and teachers are in accompanied story with“ hypocritical ones - a message for children as “the switch ”
Crossley-Holland, who, from English, translated by epos Beovulf and also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Mayors, says: “You can have good intentions, but you can do better if you keep them for yourself.
Probably the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and adults writing for children is a feeling of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended with a happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be blind; revealed by means of a story, not openly determined.
The old truth is, it's better to show than to describe.
The Brno starhouse will take visitors to space in a new digitarian
At first sight, it is obvious that the Hall of Great Planetary has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can crash into new comfortable seats and above their heads there was a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
In order to be perfect, other smaller designers are scattered after the hall.
Another important part of the device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
“There are 20 computers that generate the painting,” said director of the Brno Star Hall Jiří Dušek.
Computers shall ensure that the image of several projectors does not cover, but gives a comprehensive impression.
“The power of computers is thirty to forty times higher than in classic personal computers,” said Tomáš Hladík.
The conductor can suck out an extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body, or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers are so respectful right in the middle of the universe or the brain of man.
Another similar facility is the closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The starhouse management plans to discuss purchased shows as well as its own creation.
From Saturday, there's two shows on the show.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about space training, fly into space, turn into censorphs, and then see the challenging conditions of astronauts in space.
The second show is for children and has the name Magic cliff - Kaluoka'hin.
It tells the story of a cliff whose pestrobaric inhabitants lived with calm life until the explosion of a nearby volcano.
The entire digitory cost about 50 million crowns, which were mainly paid by the Ministry of Education.
A smaller amount also contributed to the town of Brno and the starhouse from its budget.
Projection area cost ten million crowns, projector 12 million.
“The rest of her association was audiovisual technology and computers,” explained Dušek.
The installation of the digiária followed after reconstruction of the entire building which the starhouse passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
We studied 11 INZERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis caught over 11 thousand ads offering a job place, of which 4300 were published in daily printing and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore becoming the most important media medium to publish job offers.
In 2005, when the survey first took place, the proportion of it was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it was around 60 percent.
In line with the analysis, any work options reflect the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertised ads in the economic prosperity period and during the economic crisis.
For example, almost 25 900 ads were published in 2007 during the same period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of a job position on the Internet is focused on a closer, particularly a more qualified professional group.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider spectrum of professions, including the workers, has been presented by the author of the analysis of Pavlína Happy.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, front advertising sites looking for managers and managers, sales agents, programmers and financial experts were captured.
The position of programmers or leading small enterprises was based only on the internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representations are particularly service and workers' professions.
Of course, the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through advertising offers include education.
Another monitored area included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the demand for knowledge of foreign language was given in three percent of ads, on the Internet at 37 percent.
Only in two percent of employers’ advertisements required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The comments on 'computer gravity' appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily print at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
Practice in the field was requested at 54 percent of ads.
Practice requirements are linked to qualified professions.
In particular, it is the Head of Production and other Head of Staff.
In particular, the working professions are mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or of electrical equipment repairers, completed by the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employees also provide requirements for the characteristics and skills of any tenderers in the middle of their ads.
As the most often required skills, communication skills appear in the first place in the first place.
In addition, employers demand flexibility, adaptation and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is a place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variable artist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the ceremony at Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling people jokes by means of an interview method.
Fay's innovation spread over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
Caroline Hirsch's festival, founder of Caroline's solo comedy institution, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they are too large to play in the club,” said Hirschová.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes Wanda Sykes’s performances, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes” (set up as heroes), an annual musical compositional benefit show at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform in addition to others.
As this festival spread, the world of comedy has spread.
Several comics participating in this year’s festival came from unconventional channels such as show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll went up with his sitter (League’s hot “League” to a fantastic-fotbal theme on FXX) and now has its own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the “Saturday Night Live” program and “Parks and Recreation” program, but most of all became famous for the rapidly spreading series of “Marcel the shell with shoes on” (muse Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognized voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, izable, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are a product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest weights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comic, but became a successful television director and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV Land show called \"Sit down the comedy with David Steinberg\"
The meeting is held in Town Hall downtown Manhattan.
“This town is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry’s work,” he said.
He told me that when he's here, he goes through a alley between two buildings and he says, \"Hey, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here.\"
The price of oil continued to fall into $96 per barrel
The price of oil on Friday continued to decline as the concerns of high stocks exported a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese production industry in the energy field.
The American oil indicator for December deliveries during the late morning has fallen in Europe's electronic trade on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel.
On Thursday there was a decrease of 39 cents and for the month of October it was 5.8 percent.
The rich oil supplies in the past few weeks burdened the price.
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Energy stated that US supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels for the last week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese production, there came an incentive for a larger demand that showed growth in activity.
This indicates that the economic recovery of China would continue to increase after the previous two weak decades.
Ropa Brent, indicator for international oil used also by American refineries, fell at the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents at $ 108.58 per barrel.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
We have the only way to say no to politicians like that.
There is a need for such pressure as Martin Hašek to be removed from all political functions and to leave the mission.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already such a waste.
Martin Hašek is agitated by the promise he has given, but everyone and politics must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babish also has the material, but it is the question whether they are politicians).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics, there is no excuse.
Mr. Hasek, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in that, unless you just lied here - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone as a man.
People will then accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a senseless weakness whose words or acts cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, to be a missing person or a lifelong show.
You may think it's unfair when I address only you, but you're a leader, and they're just a misguided sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to put your ears down for a while, regroup your forces, suck your shame, and then attack again, but that's how they behave partisans or suspects.
You're, I repeat, in your eyes, leader, alpha male, so act like this.
Accept responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulations relating to the detention procedure and search for police department persons in NY
The Federal Court of Appeal blocked the judicial orders requiring changes in the programme of detention and search for persons at the police department in New York and the Judge of the case appealed.
The second U.S. appeal to the federal court said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision to appeal to the city.
The judge decided in August that the city had infringed the Constitution by implementing its programme of stopping and questioning people.
The city’s conclusions and its amending regulations were found, including the decision to allocate surveillance to the police department to help change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Board of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the withdrawal requested.
The Board of Appeal said that the judge must be dismissed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of the complaint, partly due to a series of talks with the media and public statements that she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they were wrong to focus on black people and Hispanics within their detention and search programme.
It established independent supervision to monitor the main changes, including the reforms in the procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test the cameras carried out on the body in certain areas where the most frequent stopping of persons occurs.
In August, New York agreed to end the method of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after the police investigation.
The oral justification for the appeal of the city is planned sometimes after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and looking for persons criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form there is a stopping and searching for people for about a number of decades, but reported tours under the management of Michael Bloomberg's independent mayor have dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases it was black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of them among minorities, filed an action that had become a case of group actions.
The advocates of changes in the programme of detention and search for persons conducted by the police department in NY claim that changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police department and may affect how these procedures use other police departments.
The sponsors claim that changes will reduce police morality, but not criminality, and that money will be wasted, but they will not solve a wider problem when the police department is under pressure after the last decade has reduced its numbers by a few thousand people.
The judge noted that she did not complete the practice of stopping and searching for people who were constitutional but reformed the way police department tours in NY.
Five shopping centres are facing low attendance
This is derived from real estate advice from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague, Bohovice opens up to the public business center of Krakow, it will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
In the Czech Republic there are now a total of 90 major business centers.
The unsatisfaction concerns about about 20 percent of the medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large centre for the location and bad layout, i.e. too much patch or complicated and unforgivable arrangement of the passions, or dead places of the center,” said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also according to the head of the retail property department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi is facing about five commercial centers with low attendance.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income categories of local residents or market accuracy in the place in question.
Some projects have opened almost fully, but their results were particularly unsatisfied at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and hate to change their shopping habits.
The new business centre must try more to attract its customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events, - supplied by Samadi.
According to Soták, the shopping center is generally stable, even in some centres rises because the tenants were willing to lower the rent and rent some units in the crisis.
However, it is true that some projects have recently opened, which have not been fully occupied and have reduced average availability (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc), - added Soták.
The business centres opened in the past two years are very slow on the market according to Sylvie Samadi.
A marketplace for new projects, but there is.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
On the market there is certainly room for the construction of smaller local projects, so called 'convinence centres', focused on purchasing and services of daily needs for residents living in the immediate vicinity,' said Samadi.
Also according to Soták there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
This is both for small centres and large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansions in regional cities.
The bridges such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have space for further growth, - added Soták.
In Prague, they see space for a prepared business centre in the Vestězná square, and they also have a clear potential of Na Příkopě street and Václavské náměstí.
“Intensively expands the expansion of retail parks that enable traders to cover and expand to increasingly smaller cities for favourable rent and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or shopping centres, as well as reconstructions of business houses Prior, which are drawn from good locations,” added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
90 modern shopping centers are currently located in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters.
The quarter of all these shopping centres is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, results from Incoma GfK's data.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the figures from Britain and France is about 50 metres from the Czech Republic to thousands of inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check his tip.
The former News of the world (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used the method “to hack into the phone, spy and confrontation” in order to confirm the false tip for the love relationship to which the Minister of Interior Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved.
Deputy Andrew Edis in Old Bailey's court said that the News of the World was caught in May 2005 by false news that Clarke was seen with his “attractive Special Consultant” Hannah Pawlby.
The news was entrusted by a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, to hack into Paulby's voicemail and penetrated her privacy, but in court, Coulson called her and left her voice messages.
“The state representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now a NoteW editor, is not a person who stands before the house and hopes that people are caught outside, but a person who likes to make stories for people to see what they say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the NoteW newspaper used three ways of examining stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confrontation.
Editor is personally involved in the third method.
She clearly knows about the other one, the surveillance, she needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says, no, we say: “But surely he knows.
The families of the love relationship that Clarke was involved were first captured by the NotW News Department when the source of sexual interest in Mrs. Pawlby was said: “You are wasting your time with Charles.
The record with voice messages taken from her phone at least three occasions was obtained in the Mulcair house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the private investigator's computer, where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “projects”
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about Paulby, said Mr. Edis.
In the meantime, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurbleck and former rapporteur James Weatherup watched the movement of Mrs Pawlby.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, in which he told her: “I got a story that we are going to issue tomorrow, and I would love to talk to Charles about. ”
Mr. Edis says that Coullson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other important figures, including former Minister David Blunkett.
At the trial on Thursday, it was said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunket for a love relationship with a married woman, while he was seeing himself with the defendant Rebeka Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks denied a partnership with other persons to hack into phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
NSA detection enhances social paranoia by the state
One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter stared over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the advice of the Federal Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Home Intelligence Agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the American pre-departure patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbanks.
The German media claims that the BfV had hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action launched an exchange of views between the US and the German foreign minister in Berlin.
James Chopper, American National Intelligence Director, again insisted that the United States does not use their foreign intelligence options in September, “to steal foreign companies’ trade secrets for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits”
But since Edward Snowden, who has become an informant, began to reveal his valuable collection from the secret monitoring of the United States, the European government and the leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they have the words of the director to believe.
After reports that the US National Security Agency conducted espionage in Brazil’s oil company and gained access to data available to US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, a general paranoia about State monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came in with a discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone might have been listening for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly the potential target as well as the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has transparented intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“The German must wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to the survey issued in July, EY's advisory service is convinced by the German company that, as regards industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses the same great risk as China.
However, in all documentation revealed by Mr Snowden there is no evidence yet that the United States has passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to their own company.
The politicians expressed their concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and stated that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The previous entrepreneurs are sceptical about it.
From the German parliament, the voices are heard that we should make German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them...
It's not a road, says Hasso Platner, President of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is delivered from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scope and technical development of US espionage agencies revealed by Snowden is for some companies who have so far thought that China is the greatest threat, yet shocking.
There is a large turnover in cloud computing technology where European leaders have generally realized that the data stored in the US fall under those jurisdictions and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of the non-American members have cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the USA.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers who has not been here a year ago - where my data is stored and you can guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction -
Many German ecclesiastes argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to separate their most valuable secrets and this data must be protected at any cost.
That economic espionage is not a surprise.
It's always been done.
“It is a key topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are doing spying on us at business and industrial level as we do spying on them because it is our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have made so as not to give the attacker the advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free memory USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least inexhaustible.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car board, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect mobile phones before the board meeting, so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Office of BfV advises managers to consider whether simple prepaid mobile phones can be used on foreign routes because of the risk that smart phones can be discredited.
The prepaid mobile phones are then fired.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
“A small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to protect business secrets effectively against unauthorised access,” warns in their report BfV.
The US warns its own company against economic espionage from other countries.
According to Washington, U.S. documents by National Intelligence Estimate have reported in February France next to Russia and Israel in the second series of perpetrators who are involved in hacking economic intelligence, right behind China.
As regards economic espionage, a member of the German risk-free society concluded that “the French are the worst, ”
Bernard Squartini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: “The servants know that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, do espionage on their allies.
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a massive battle spirit in his high school gym believe that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valvata, Georgia, was found stuck in a turbulent spirituality in a high school gym where he went.
The Sheriff's investigators from Lowerdes County concluded that Johnson died of an unfortunate accident, but the family of 17-year-old refuses.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” he said for FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacques Johnson.
They never believed he died just as the sheriff declared.
“They believe that this contradicts logic, physical laws, and a sound sense,” said Crump.
They believe that this is to be done, what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
“ As usual, they sent their son to school, and he returned to their dead body bag, ” he said.
The State Secretary Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a normal investigation of Johnson's death, and he noted that several key questions had not been answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
He told Moore at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts, wherever I'm going.
My goal is to find out the truth.
\"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation,\" he said.
Moore told the journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of the “space suffocation”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, indicated another cause of death.
“ There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death to investigate a crime or violation of civil rights, he would ask the FBI and execute it.
The deputy sheriff's office from Lowerdes District was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
The judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators checked.
Young parents hope that videos will contain a trace leading to the discovery of how their son died.
The CDC Centre has issued a Directive on allergy in children for school
In the centre of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a set of directives to help with child allergy to food at school has been published.
This is the first set of directives issued by the US Government because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergy is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergy in children increased between 1997 and 2007 by 18 percent.
The directive includes information for schools on how to notify the teachers and staff of child food allergy and how to respond to allergic reactions if it occurs.
Schools are also recommended to have adrenaline available, most often an automatic EpiPen injector, in order to respond to potentially dangerous hypersensitivity.
The State legislators recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more simply.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say: “It’s like someone has pushed me into the tongue - “I feel like I have hair on my tongue - or “I have a knowledge of my tongue. ”
Intersexual children’s parents can choose “undeterminable sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with ununificational sexual regimes.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either male or female sex.
A new law from parents does not require that they include any sex for such children and allows them to put sex on their birth lists as “undefined” or “non-specific”
The purpose of the law is to stop pushing parents to make their child’s choice of operation for the purpose of determining sex and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One intersexual person according to BBC, after many years, said: “I am neither a man nor a woman--
I'll stay with the slatin created by doctors, assisted and scarred.
It is estimated that every year 2000 children are born one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomals, sexual glands (voice or varlata) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
The setting of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to identify it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out if at all.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-related problems, said that the new German law “is like a good thing, ”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in life-threatening condition, which requires surgery, but it is not true for most children,” he said.
The determination of sex can be done without surgery and then it can wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of the child’s sexual personality is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why it's happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgenic people, because their status is not related to sex, but on their biological structure which is not solely neither male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and character, in primary sex characteristics such as reproduction organs and sex regimes, or in the structure of chromosomals and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the working area, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who are not responsible for any gender now have special camps.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark in official documents of male, female or “third sex”
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the first person to be considered “in June ” when she won the court appeal, so that she could leave the status of “unnatural sex.
According to the Ministry of Interior, there will be German passports except M (men) and F (wild) and third markings, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the news report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed petitions for the removal of “the theory of sex” from school textbooks
The American web site Catholic online has also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is attracted to a new state when sex is a matter of choice, but it is a matter of sexual activity not, we are turning on two more pillars of civilization.
One mother of New York from Maryland also said for Baby Zone that she'd rather see the children join the sex at birth.
“Rodicity itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she expressed herself for the website about parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children with both male and female sex called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had double sex.
And for about ten years, the medical community thought that sex was like a table that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide incorrectly, because they do not know how to feel when they grow up with their sex.
“In the middle of the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The continuing theory of dealing with children with ununificational sex was presented by Dr. John Money at the Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was subject.
He created a new concept of “manufacturing,” he argued that social causes and environmental effects, as parents raised their children’s children’s genes and hormones and created a child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/Joan, ” his theory became a disputed one.
The boy's parents, whose penis was damaged due to the wrong circumcision, recommended that their child be completely cast out, removed and raised as a girl.
“Mydia presented this case as a successful transition, but the fact was different,” said Drescher.
When the boy was 15 years old, he got back on the boy and married a woman.
In 38 years, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “they use that model today.
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the Internet’s arrival, the survivors of these operations appeared to “be restless with the result.”
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, born with male chromososomes, but inconceivable sex regimes.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitor or a small penis, and they believed that as a man he could never live “a satisfying life. ”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from external organs and testes and was raised as a girl.
In 12 years, he got female hormones.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he said for ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
In 18 he was sent to a plastic vagina.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After my birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop its sex equipment correctly.
After he learned the truth, he turned back on men, took the dose of testosterone and had him removed his breasts,
Operations caused his infertility.
Today he represents another organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perceptions of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, a legal director of the Advocates legal group for the informed tree (announced elections) based in California, is concerned that the German law “quite to smell and stigmats“
“ Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that they will encourage parents to make rapid decisions and choose “neurious” for their children, ” she said.
We're afraid it'll be an intervention.
We think it's better to assign them to male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will eventually appeal, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because “lets adults choose to be included in the third sex”
“The adult should be able to make their own decision of legally valid sex,” she said.
The German law is about to assign it at birth.
It's a battle that a small child shouldn't be seduced at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radioologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a disorder in sexual development and helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law “will share powers - both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomals, but she has a MD-related syndrome called insensitive to androgens.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, they have evolved into Katie's female features.
He's got vagina, but he doesn't have cannon and ovary.
Now she's 29-year-old Katie's married and she's working as an intern for paediatric psychology in Pennsylvania.
Although it is infertile, it hopes that it will become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
“The law will give parents a certain space to avoid rushing with their decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think about it and give them time before they write “the man, or the wife, ”
In this regard, everything is fine - you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy it.
You don't have to rush to surgery that's unreturnable.
“It brings the opportunity to engage in decisions and children and separates the anxiety parents because they have no certainty that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide what sex is more identified - and that is a great thing.
It gives the children the power to make their own decisions.
Monkey swallowed the entire house with gasoline: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
The tension was increasing, the fear was rising.
The man started threatening to set the house on fire.
To that end, all available police guards in the area, as well as a firefighter unit from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of voluntary firefighters, went out.
There was also a police negotiator who tried to excuse his irrational behavior.
The man still threatened to set the house on fire.
So she had to enter into the house and enter an intervention unit that disabled men and bound them.
Aggressor then ended up studying at a youth hospital where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic hospital.
The firefighters, in the end, put the house on the petrol into a sorbbent that they cleaned up later.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
The man didn't go to the E.R.A., so the commander went to see him.
Message: Obama's campaign to replace Biden as Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, has secretly considered his replacement to the 2012 vice president Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most important sensations of a patiently expected 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012”
The Times magazine received a copy of the coming books and announced on Thursday evening that the President’s top co-workers held an intensive group meeting and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether the release of Biden would help revive Obama’s pale hope of re-election.
According to the national-political correspondent for Times, Jonathan Martin's magazine, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former Head of the White House of Bill Daley, to measure what effect it should be to move former Minister Clinton abroad to the vice president.
Potential change was a strictly protected secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few presidents of the nearest consultants, including Dale, former Chief of Obama's campaign, Jim Messina, and former leading advisers at David Axelrod's White House, and David Plouffe, knew that this change was considered.
The book “Doble down” claims that Daley was a representative of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would “Obama’s chances would not significantly increase,”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
“I have studied a number of things intensively, and this was one of them,” said Dalea.
You must not forget that at that time the President had terrible prospects, so we thought: “Kristepane, what to do--
While Daley characterised research as “the importance of care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the campaign for re-election had made a small investment to determine whether this move would pay.
“In the campaign, such money is not spent on election and qualitative research, unless something is seriously considered,” Martin said AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team considered this exchange.
Martin said for CNN that Daley asked if his boss knew about this potential mixing of cards.
While Daley said that he did not think that the president thought that the potential change “was conscious,” the former chief of the office admitted that it was “the possibility that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Double down” was definitely not responding to the question of whether the political probe was reached up to Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research he was doing about cutting Biden out from the candidate.
“Maybe Martin answered.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream that shines in darkness using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a radiant pamphlet.
He came up with an idea when he read an expert treat for jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that makes light-ups.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s language - increases pH levels in protein and then causes radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when she reacts with the heat of your mouth, and therefore the more you fly, the brighter the light.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious”, says: “It’s an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we’re at the beginning, so for GBP 200 you get about 2 g of this substance,
The white we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth of protein warms up, the pH level increases and the ice cream starts to shine.
We've been testing her over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the lightening of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And that cost me about GBP 140.
But delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unusual flavor of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
His other product is to be even more ambitious.
He says: “In fact, I would like to make an invisible ice cream.
In essence, it's impossible for the ice crystals that make ice crystals, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
The freezing uses the fluorescence properties of the jellyfish produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat candy, stay up long and show up to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a dove.
After two years of my apartment, candy didn't appear, and it's probably not going to be different this year.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween, black sheep.
According to the State retail Federation (NRF) this year, the majority of Americans will celebrate Halloween - in fact 158 million of them - and spend a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and ornaments.
But what I look forward to every Halloween year is trends.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion lost is expected to be 1.2 billion for costumes.
This year, they're the last shot of fashion hot non-smoking objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy food can be like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect you to see a lot of zombies thanks to the dead parade, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will reach our channels this year in Instagram.
According to Google, zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted ones.
I assume there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year, we put our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones to see me.
In fact, Americans according to the NRF will spend $330 million this year on animal lover costumes.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend 1.9 billion dollars.
This is about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, the sweetness of Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark's bars.
This is an amazing report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the U.S. Ministry of Trade, are going to fall over our fourth.
In fact, we will buy during Halloween, and believe not to believe and conjure, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet according to the National Sugar Association around Halloween, it will sell nearly 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion different corn candy.
That's a secret I've never worked out.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as the “Terror behind the walls” (Hrhyza behind the walls, which is, by the way, real prison) “Howl-O-Scream” (Jekot, algae) and “The house of shock” (house of shock).
In fact, in the United States there are officially dedicated 1200 haunted houses, which, according to American scary houses, have a profit of 500 million dollars, and this includes amazing pictures of you in which you're peeing with fear and which your friend will give on Facebook, and you can't remove them and the person you like will take a picture and write a comment as “hess become the face”
And in the end, something little about pumpkins.
Since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the great pumpkin (Greeat Pumpkin) and cutting pumpkin corn is something like a Christmas tree - we do it from a baby.
Fortunately, for us, the trend of “baby in the pumpkin” started with the Pinterest only last year, so most of us grew up in the fact that we cut the sticks instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. population's office, Americans spend about 106 million dollars in the pumpkin.
The pumpkin lucerna with a soft spot on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkin grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from the town of Napa in California and try to cut their pumpkins weighing almost one tonne.
Known series of racing Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercommunication devices.
The choice is improved brakes, a service package providing access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of vehicles between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed, ” said Drew Bowler Motorsport.
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an excellent journey to world-class races.
We are glad that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that they will prepare competitions for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
The development of the car Defender Challenge we have really enjoyed - it will be a really exciting competition.
In February, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day, as well as the possibility to compete in desert races in the north of Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have an early election.
The President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election in the front.
Week after the last interview for Currently.cz said there was no other east, and every government came from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible chicken.
“It cannot last long,” said Karel Schwarzenberg that the life-life period of the starting parliamentary period is estimated to be within two years.
The problem is that the voters will hardly choose differently next time, they disagree: ‘I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making’
At the same time, President TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in other elections as this year (by 2010 it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that the early elections will be, it will strengthen the movement ANO 2011 Andrei Babis.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will be lost.
The Turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret Irish meeting, declared that he or Michal Hašek would remain in the direction of social democracy, commenting on Schwarzenberg:
“The leading democratic actors of how little boys are going to the head of the state to allow them to turn on the side”
I thought Mr. Hašek was more elegant and intelligent.
“Because I have not seen anything so unpreparedly done in my life,” said President TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (with whom he encountered in the fight for the presidential function) he insisted: ‘The head of the state is clear: He wants to strengthen the party’
The first law has already presented TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise choice for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Farm Register of Contracts, which had been discussed before the elections by the House, but had fallen under the table with premature choices.
Chairman of TOP 09 in an interview for Currently.cz claims that such speed is given by the need for these laws.
At the same time, however, the TOP 09 clearly wants to precede similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election of the idea of establishing a register of contracts - robs the ANO movement program.
TOP 09 has now been used by uskok - she has simply lost the proposal that had already been completed into the second snow reading.
Firemen came to save the lost puppy, stuck 15 meters above the ground at a dangerous spell in stonelom
The coach of the Spanish Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was trapped in a stonehouse saw a man walking a dog.
Firemans have fallen down the rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The Štěně was liberated by fire troops who came to free him after somehow he was trapped on a dangerous spell in a stonehouse 15 meters above the ground.
Nine months of Spanish Ruby blanket ran away after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he lived three days alone until he was released from the stoneworks Wednesday.
His owners Scott Aldson (25) with his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit stonehouse in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, he was zealously looking for his lost dog and put challenges on social networks.
In the middle of about 14.15 he saw a bright-looking dog who was trapped in Ruby for a break in a stonehouse 15 metres above ground.
He moved a technical rescue team from the Clekkheaton fire station and broke down to free Ruby, using it to pick up the animal transport bag on a rock.
Officer Andy Clayton said, \"The dog was in a dangerous situation.\"
It was right in the middle of a rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the back.
He didn't move the gate during the rescue - he was completely frozen.
But now she's okay.
He got cookies then.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that someone's seen a dog is incredible.
The Technical Rescue Team Officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky during his escape.
There was a possibility that he would be very badly injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a visit, and besides exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Ms. Hall of Halifax in West York, said: “When I looked at the rescue event, I was afraid,
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to keep him in his arms again.
The vet said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firefighters have done a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they're all just great.
Mr. Aldson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he could fall, but he remained there.
Firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that after 18-year-old Katy Perry didn't make it.
During the interview for the Australian Radio Show, this pop star this week said that for Jagger’s song “Old habits die hard”, she sang accompanying vocals from 2004.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he went after her.
She added: “That was a long time ago, and now he is very kind to me.
In his statement of Thursday Jagger's (70) representative, he said that categoricals refused to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The representative said: “Maybe he is wrong with someone else.
Perry was one of those visiting singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert string this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Split Europe gives Scottish a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for an independent Scottish membership in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This led to stories about passive controls in Berwick and the barbed wire along Hadrián's Valu.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as could be expected, this did not refer to the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do so.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of a continuing non-compliance would be a cheap return to Brussels for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a rather weak story.
Moreover, so old that he became a digger. A novice duck that “independence means passive control, ” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is one interesting thought in this bearded story.
Why should it even be expected that independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why replace London's crotch for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a real European story: the big post-war plan to unite Europe has finally collapsed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called Europe Project officially dead.
Through Europe, the parties are committed to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of Alternativa for Germany, based in this year, came as if it had gone out of nowhere and already in the September federal elections, rooted almost five million votes, which essentially resulted in “free Democrats” (the equivalent of British liberal Democrats).
There has always been a resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The biasedness of Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the enthusiasts, has brought many people to the view that Europe's project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that the national government is managing a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members on exchange rates beneficial for German exporters, and German politicians want to remain.
Without the possibility of devaluating domestic currency, Southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only aid is to reduce revenue and public expenditure, which is encouraged by Germany.
The deeper cause of European small performance is behind current problems with the budget and currency.
As a result of ‘green’ energy policy supported by Brussels, the code for support by French and German companies to consumer costs, the European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol than it is in the United States.
This is a paralysing disadvantage in the area of costs as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freezing of wages in the world would not reverse the collapse of the European petrochemical industry with cheap abdominal oil from the US.
The result is a forced rebellion, especially in France, once an EU enthusiast.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument to keep Germany in line and allow Paris to stand up in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, does not need Paris as an ID of political legitimacy and has promoted its own economic policy in Europe and has left the French economy to its destiny.
Result: The true wing of Marine Le Pens, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and moved the ruling socialists to third place.
Fronta is now with 24% of the most popular party in France - a timely warning to the British Labourists that they cannot assume that the brushing of the right automatically becomes positive on the left.
How does Le Pen base his newly acquired popularity among the Belarusian working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European block against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely to be such a block may for the first time dominate the European Parliament's history.
I believe that, in the apparent time, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will be linked and the euro will be lost.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more freer in the sense of “Europe (suveren) nations” - already favoured General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, the increased interest in Washington in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland going?
We can choose to be areas (in principle) of little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - even the possibility to announce Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I assume Scotland would have done well in a relaxed European arrangement, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other countries of the same kind would be easier in the non-Federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The Government of SNP in Scotland is, by means of opposition attitude towards the cuts planned (and implemented) by the Labourist Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland would now vote for independence just to take the cost-effective measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white coats.
Physical changes don't mean that puberty is coming.
It is not demonstrated that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts claim that one of the ex-conceptors of earlier puberty could be an outbreak of obesity.
Trend of the earlier puberty isn't that obvious with the boys.
Former rapporteur CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in the health of children and family problems.
Should her mother be amazed when her daughter starts growing tits and deafening on shame in seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida explained the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these physical changes are quite common among the American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time ensuring that my parents are usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, shame chilling and body smell, appear earlier in the girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there was only a slight change at the age when the first menstruation took place.
In the United States it is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
“When the breasts begin to develop, they will reach for at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” Kaplowitz said, also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with this Common Problem - (Casy puberty in girls: An essential manual to handle this common problem)
The most reliable test on how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual beginning of the puberty, but if growth is accompanied by a growth spurt 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be “predominantly advanced”
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - which can be carefully monitored by children’s doctors.
Faster growth can be the reason for endocrinologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: early bone ageing, which can eventually lead to a halt in growth and insolence in adulthood.
The recommendations for drugs and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the speed of development, growth rate and emotional deterioration.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
With regard to drug deployment, Kaplowitz is careful, but acknowledges that “the suppression of puberty can ease the problems with the behavior of a girl and her feelings that differ from its peers, ”
Another big problem is: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their menstruation.
“They worry that he can get pregnant or how he manages hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers one woman, whose daughter began to have menstruation in 10 years.
Even though there were signs, and we talked about mentration, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry about being one of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no related set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
The caplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
In 2001 he helped to conduct a study in girls aged between six and nine, which combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their Belarusian counterparts.
Explanations are different.
From a global point of view, the patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything possible from economic conditions over climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although in boys of low age there is a feeling of deep in the face and shame, the trend towards a full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other doctors participating in the American Association of Child Doctors (AAP) conference have added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and deafness of shame is common even in infants and batolat.
“We must be careful with regard to how we identify the actual arrival of the puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endokrinologist from Goryeb children’s hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child doctor as to how to speak to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to a child before you could assume,” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
The girls who develop earlier need assurance that even though this is happening early, this process is a common part of life.
Nadya Konvalinková as a pub.
Does he have a new job?
The actress Nadya Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the hive in the role of the farm and she was very good at it.
That a popular Czech actress would have planned a change of profession and applied to business in the pub?
Nadya Konvalinková appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and shot beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
Even the boss offered me a job, and I could feed beer with a spin.
But I refused, I would rather stay at what I do today in acting,\" she betrayed the smile of Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the functioning of the Irish pub.
\"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there,\" she betrayed her taste of actress.
Nadi's long-time friend and colleague Pavel New appeared in the event.
I'm dead, and I can't cool in this new life.
I am allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that is what I am trying to follow,” added the actor.
Producers of aircraft are applied for the width of seats, large contracts are at stake
Among the leading aircraft producers, there was a dispute about the width of seats in the second class at long distance flights, which led this month to a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The object of the dispute is the width of seats provided for the long distance flights for the economic class, not just the one which would normally be preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency claims for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called for industrial standards this week, which would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they have to decide on this.
The dispute occurred at the time when aircraft producers competed in the sale of their two-engine long distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear part of the aircraft is unloaded, especially if 9 or 10 seats are next to each other, is the basis for economic performance claims for the proposals of new aircraft ‘mini-jumbo’
Boeing says that the improved model “777X” will correct 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm divided by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its model A350 will deliver 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats distributed after 9.
Giant aeroplanes often face each other's technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before the Dubai air show, where it is expected that 777X is over 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what might be the start of a new advertising war when the financiers showed a picture showing three people stuck in a restaurant with a title “Do not like it.”
“The Boeing promotes long-term flights in the seats more narrow than they are on regional turbines,” said Airbus John Leahy.
As food bait changes, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 Jumbo defined modern long distance air transport to the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Health Ministry, average American weight increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years of age.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seat from the 1950s, when the average width of the seat of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that she has carried out a research that suggests that the spread of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
The Boeing dimensions of Airbus seats rejects and says that it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide on how the airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than on the width of the seat.
‘The fact is, to provide the airline with flexibility and enable them to do things they believe to be done to be successful,’ said the expert at Kent Craver cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is a major space for elbows, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect revenues.
This is behind the dispute, an aircraft race with estimated trade in the next decades is worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to stand up to the scales of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they reach 20 percent better efficiency in their last two-engine remote aircraft proposals than market leaders in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance claims of Boeing depend partly on comparing the design of the 777X model with 10 seats in a series and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weak compared to the 10-seventh concept.
“The reason Boeing does this is to rush more seats, and make his aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the comfort of the passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in series for existing models 777 are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for denser distribution, which can go hand in hand with lower charges.
“The number of five inches would be great for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus is motivated by a 777 threat,” said the expert on the interior of Mary Kirby cabin, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't deliver seats, but they offer the airline a catalogue of suppliers to choose.
The investigation of aircraft dealers even carry a measuring band with them to check competitive arrangements.
While the comfort of all manufacturers is increasing, it also offers high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Until now, Airbus stressed the need for greater adjustment of the cabin so that it offered a wider seat in the alleys in some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of one other manufacturer of large modern aircraft the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard, but it can reflect from the waves of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected has exceeded 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected grows every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection of 50 people, five years later they were 121, and 180 of them were already in 2010.
Last year, there was 212 infected, and it was a record number.
“The total number of newly diagnosed cases has exceeded 200 times this year, I think there is no doubt,” said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavátý, who led the Prague Light House for patients for years.
According to him from January to September, 165 HIV patients arrived in the country, this year during the same period were 176.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of this September, HIV confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Mediterranean, 206 infected were resident.
The diagnosis also listened to 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravskoslezsky or 116 from Ústeck.
At least infected comes from Vysočina, 19 of them.
A total of 88% of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people were infected with blood transfusions in the past.
Such a case has not occurred since the beginning of the testing, which is why more than a quarter of the century.
Six children were born with HIV, and they were transferred from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but it's a beautiful look, says experts
The fantastic movie from the universe of Gravity sold some time after the premiere in the Czech cinema.
For October he was seen by the Union's film distributors almost 150 thousand viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
However, there are certain irregularities in it.
Server Lidovka.cz asked experts from many astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Starhouse director and planetary Brno): I like science-fantastic films that I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The movie Gravity does not specify even if it is called “physically real” performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he'd be bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow doesn't seem to be in a state of difficulty.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Stations are moving on a wide variety of orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of film determine the unrealistic effect and at all the conduct of fire in a state of difficulty.
They don't think the suit would last such a fight.
The Indians in the movie Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and suits without more trouble, they will last everything.
Critics weren't saved or a storyy.
This vast tragedy on the orbit of the earth is unrealistic according to some of the discussing.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People argue about the “nerable” behavior of lan.
He says it's acting like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Oldor and planetary of Prague): I have seen him only on a wide canvas yet, but I can clearly say I was charming.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (measure of duty) not to stick consistently with reality.
I was affected by the three times the space station with the degrading level of technology (the last of China) - before you mentioned irregularities.
“The Chinese will finally be after the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it is in the film”
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successfully trying not to break physical laws, and so naturally oriented viewer will appreciate that during various space collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum, said by the dictionary physics, is also very realistic on Earth from the universe, including thin tubs of atmosphere and polar grains that are surrounded by the polar areas.
I'm sure they'll be able to find a more detailed investigation.
I have, for example, found in reading comments that the preferred direction of circulation of the space pack on the orbital course appears to be reversed in some scenes before it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (Employer of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and in heaven calling for a probs against logic or natural laws I did not notice in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus is seen that creators had taken care of the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth calling it the fact that Hubble's space telescope lies in a different orbit than ISS.
The result is a very different mutual speed and rescue operation could therefore not in fact take place as shown in the film.
In addition, at the moment of the Kowalski Department (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire IFRS would be rotating, so there is no clear source of force in Kowalski, which forces both actors to start at the moment when they are no longer moving against each other.
A new vaccine against Nicotine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against Nicotine, which can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from the load on Nicotine for life.
Before testing people, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Health Faculty Weill Cornell in New York says the first signs are good.
“We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of chickens who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods currently available in the market, but have found that their dependence on Nicotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that was designed to provide genetic information for the formation of antinicotin antibodies.
Virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which will then begin to create a smooth flow of these antibodies.
Antibodys pursue all of Nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and don't spend them before they get into the brain, thus preventing the chicken getting a Nicotinal intervention.
During the examinations of the vaccinated mouse, which was added by additional nitrates, continued their normal activities.
But the mice that were not inocinated, “they calmed down,” said the researchers, which is a sign of the fact that Nicotin got into their brains.
Experiences are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be administered as often as possible to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies, so they appeared to be expensive and non-circular.
Costs for new vaccines should be much lower because they convert liver cells into a factory to produce antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people were completely safe, they could be treated for children before they wanted to try a cigarette, and they would avoid addiction to Nicotine.
Much more likely, however, the chickens would use it to stop.
“ They will know that when they start smoking again, they will have no benefits for the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists say the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denys that Obeid would influence him
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for the Surveillance of Corruption.
Former Minister of New Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal lease policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeida, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government of the controlled land.
On Friday, an independent corruption committee (ICAC) extended its search to whether Mr. Obeid lobbyed with several state ministers to hire him at Circle Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and cafes, restored without having to participate in the selection procedure after his conclusion in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid's secret interests on these properties, on the basis of the evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy director, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed the government to go to the public competition.
The renters were against it, and they also wanted more long-term contractual conditions.
In 2009, leases were renewed for the companies in Circle Quay, which Obeid added annually, without having to participate in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the minister of ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a public competition promoter.
But he claimed that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeida, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on moving into government rental policy.
The translation of the calls submitted in ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mrs Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunn, the lead official who came to the port branch after he worked under Mr. Obeid in the fishing department.
“It was the subject of talks during these phone calls for development of commercial rental policy,” said Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr Tripodi.
\"No,\" Mr Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but not about this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
The Israeli military planes attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible factor
The Israeli military aircraft hit the target on Thursday night at the Syrian port of Lazíkija, confirmed the responsible administrator of Fox News Station.
This responsible factor specifically did not say what was the objective, but said it was at least one.
The Press Association Press states that the targets were the SA-125 Russian rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel launched an air attack on the supply of rockets in Syria.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentator Pečinek spoke by agreeing to it, while the President of Štěch was divulging an accident.
Heytman Chovac was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
The President of Sobotka has always been, and he is still a symbol of the ČSSD poverty.
The other gentlemen have demonstrated their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is a basic and readable, Vice-President Zaorálek has made the most of the conversation on TV.
Based on this, I don't see a better option than having the ČSSD proposed by Vice-President of the Senate Gajdůšková, the only one wouldn't have the initial hendikep and I don't think she would have done the standard performance.
That's such a good solution that hardly anyone in charge will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could, without concern, put together a minority government with just a blessing from the President of Babylon and without the people, but with the human minister, Hovork, who is actually a religious social democracy.
This minimum government would have a lot of stability because it would promote a proper referendum law and have committed itself to supporting the President of Okamura.
President Babiš would eventually accept the progression of taxes, because he's smart and he'll see it's impossible without her.
People wouldn't bring problems, because Havorka is the best man they have, and they wouldn't otherwise be in the government.
The same applies to ANO, even here would be a valuable minister, but if they do not reasonably want to enter a risky government participation, but they will provide support also well.
Let's add the courage to Alice Gajdets!
Foreign visa-registered personnel may undergo a ‘rightful’ test.
As the government intends to expand police procedures, it considers the ‘legality test’ for foreign visa workers 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied by means of criteria to prevent the programme of 457 being used to complete unqualified jobs, or as a back door to move families and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion was published today, the former Labour Member Maxine McKew condemned the government rhetoric of foreign workers, saying that it could insult the Australian neighbours.
“The strong statement of “citizens at the end of the line” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant from the time union demanded a protected labour market,” said Australia-Indian Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white labor force was to be protected - and I would not wonder if anyone in this region recorded the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article takes account of 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he was dealing with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others were considered.
Where the criteria ‘legality’ are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in relation or a personal connection with the owner or relevant person sponsoring the undertaking’s undertaking;
After previous experience with businesses who intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employing hundreds of them, companies may also require a justification for the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who was seeking asylum died of a suspected heart attack after he arrived at the asylum ship on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine-year-old, scared son traveled to Australia along with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities and men were in a hurry to the hospital in the Christmas islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the railway project HS2 for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests high speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
Minister of Transport, Baron Kramer said that the project “contributes to Great Britain together”
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said that he was working with the British Government on this plan “exploited”
The first phase will consist of new high-speed train lines between London and West Midlands.
After Faz's completion, two of them will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government overestimated the estimated costs of building high-speed lines between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the National Transport Agency of Scotland, entrusted HS2 to determine further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of event travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
She said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that is better connected to the UK and its cities.
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without this, we face the crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, there is also a connection - across Great Britain, thanks to HS2, there will be a better link between 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.
Mr. Carmichael, behind the Scottish Government, called for “one thing” to support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland with disproportionate economic advantages, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain.
We are therefore excited to cooperate with the British Government to investigate the possibilities to bring high-speed railways to Scotland and thus bring all the benefits and add the line of Glasgow-Edinburgh, the Scottish government as planned.
I look forward to examining the report on this study, together with the British Ministers during the next year and on the joint decision on further steps.
Together with Bart, she arrested the inspection and analysts of anticorruption police.
Information on the arrest of the Vita Barta began to spread on Thursday night when the message brought the server First-prava.cz.
MF DNES found that the case was in charge of the General Security Corps (GIBS), its people should have arrested Bart in the centre of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where they are among accused policemen, but its competence also applies to civilian persons.
According to MF DNES, there is also one anti-corruption police officer who is leading analysts and computer sciences by Jan Petržílek.
He worked for Security Information Services in the past.
The spokesperson of the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, but refused to comment on the information that the media has to turn to the GIBS in this matter.
Her spokesperson's inspection Radka Sandor, but she didn't want to say anything about the case, she referred to the City State Representation in Prague.
“We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts,” said Štěpánka Zenklová spokesperson.
Also, from this undiscretionable reaction, it can be said that the event has happened, but there is a secret procedure that the spokesperson does not allow to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's attorney Oldři Chudoba is also involved.
The media said that Bart is representing, and in this matter, but given the fact that it is classified information, Bart's arrest cannot confirm or reverse.
Some media were first speculating that Bart's arrest might be related to a police president named Petr Lessy.
This was promoted to Bart, together with former chairman of VV Radek John, who was in charge of the Home Office.
The dispute that made it worse between the ex-premier Peter Nečas and the VV had to even solve the same President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship came from to my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
\"I really don't know anything about things,\" said IGNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the police chief.
Officially, Radek John, the real boss of the party, but then Bart was.
Bárta now ran for the election for the Holy Movement, the parliamentary mandate escaped only close - at 175 votes.
The dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
“The Kingdom of Bárta was one of many candidates for our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the direct democracy of Tomia Okamura,” he continued to take part in Bárty Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bart space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executors.
The arrival of Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former associate at the VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft will remain valid in Australia
Travelling Australian airlines will still have to switch off their tablets and smart phones during starting and landing regardless of the changes in the US to mitigate the rules on these devices.
The US Federal Air Administration (FAA) has given American companies space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the devices remain in “airline” mode.
Travelers can already do this during the vast part of the flight, but many people are annoying that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the start and landing.
Australian carriers examine this decision, which requires a lot of work from American carriers to meet the requirements, but they indicated that they do not have plans to change their procedures at a short time.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CEA) also said that the notification was examined but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft,’ he said.
This question is covered by the rules which require the aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers are acting in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about the extension of the use of its vi-fi on board entertainment system, has been amended, but has announced that it will be subject to the decision of the regulatory authority.
“We would welcome the CASA's analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (free board entertainment), improved customer experience,” said the spokesperson.
Qantas has announced that for the time being, it will stick to current regulations.
“Our current policy is such that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it in a short time,” he said.
FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful for our passengers, and we are sure to study the FAA decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the USA, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their air park.
The carriers will have to say that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
‘As soon as the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, passengers may allow the passenger to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude, the FAA said.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the crew shall order passengers to shut down the device during landing.
The group also recommended that heavy equipment be safely stored under the seat or storage space above the head.
With the growing whiteness of the middle class they experience stops in Singapore,
Janni Amirthalinga's golden bracelet, ring and earrings are stopped in the shopping centre of Bendemeer in Singapore so that she can pay her daughter the school bracelet.
“We just bought our husband a house and I put all my money on it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as a administrator gets $2400 and her husband also works, family monthly income is inadequate, she says.
The demand across the regions in South East Asia - where the household debt is increased - is indeed such that ValueMax, where the woman carries out her transaction this week, became the third stop on the ladder in Singapore.
The suspension of jewels is not only a quick way to lend cash - 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as undeserved bank loans.
The stops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above 15.4 % of the rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the stophouses have the advantage that they do not require the verification of the person(s) or the income document and may provide a loan faster than the banks.
Therefore, with the pressure of families on the increase in the cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt, millions across the region are turning to a halt.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by free money policy in advanced economies with families with low and medium income, they turn to a halt in order to deal with a worsening financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia for gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the head of the 80 percent of GDP ladder, which is an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
The Ekonomics were also afraid of a high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week only came from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The important thing is that with rising costs, people from medium to low [direct range] will try to complete their income wherever they can,” said Song Song Won, the economy in the Malaysian CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people leave their own personal possessions well behind the opportunity to exchange their family jewels for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 urban stops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we'll stop the grandmother's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest operators held in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded in recent months up to 20% increase in the number of customers using its stophouse.
The growth in the construction sector is so great that ValueMax, the branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans not only to expand to neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also outside Asia, says CEO ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD, which it won at the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discounted creditors were under the fire of criticism because of high interest, Mrs. Yeah says that the establishment offers not only lower rates than other creditors but also does not directly increase the debt.
“The customers stop objects that they already own, and the pursuit of personal property does not increase household debt,” he says.
The establishment of assets is increasingly accepted as a means to secure short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use the stops, they're not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold rods or Rolex watches, and they can get up to 60 percent of the shopping price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
“They include rich individuals who need to borrow short-term money because of their courageous business or investment, or small businesses who need help to solve problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million forite health
The Federal Government insists that the rescue package of 325 million dollars for the dying health in Tasmanie contains hard conditions to ensure that the government does not freeze funds.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Australian Union was “aggravated measures - to reverse the crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for four years was decided after government consultations with the independent members of Andrew Wilk.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that, as we believe, solves the specific problems facing the state,” Mrs Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars for surgery at the patient's request.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grey-circuit operations, will help to remove the debt.
Money is also available to publicly accessible clinics in Hobarta and Launceston, better post-operative care, training specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the thoughts that the leading clinical doctors have told me that the best way to help the Tunisian health system is to be helped,” Mrs Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tribal Government must require a strict reporting and statutory regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money of the Australian Union and inform each month about where additional funding was spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that 325 million dollars will not be useless, “until the real reform will follow for a more sustainable basis for the Turkish public health system,
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for rapid assistance, which he had first raised in the negotiations with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I believe that a federal aid package can remove state health from critical state,” said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly reverse recent cuts.
A federal opposition spokesperson in the field of health, Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just a “pity, ”
“The reason why I am here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our medical system,” he said for the ABC TV.
You can't have a government government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that spends $300 million, and it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar from the rescue package will be spent on a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoloux adapted to Denise Diderota's amendment, which brings an exceptional film expedition and the formation of time, but it's also more boring than it should be.
They develop in the 1960 ’ s in France and tell a gloomy story about Susanne, a young noble family sent to the monastery.
When he wakes up, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally perverted mother presented and becomes an object of sexual passion for others.
The film will never slip into coldness or somnolence, and that is his problem.
This story's circuit shot leads to the fact that the audiences will experience the same mucus of the thirsty shirt.
Skiareals want to get rid of families with children
Syria destroyed its resources for the manufacture of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, said, on Thursday, the Committee on Global Surveillance of Chemical Guns, while the sharp conflicts in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poison substances are stored according to assumptions.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also stated that more than 120 000 people had been killed since the start of civil war nearly three years ago.
The report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Guns came on the day before 1 November,
the date which that organisation established in Haag has fixed Damascus for destruction or decommissioning of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals in order to create toxic gas and to carry out ammunition.
The completion of this in principle is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Extensive equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But the lady must begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
It is expected that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including the yperitivity and nervous gas sarina.
The announcement came at the moment that on Thursday the fight in Safira, which experts speak of as the site of the chemical weapons and storage factory, said the Syrian observation officer for human rights based in Britain.
A group of activists monitored the total number of victims through the network of activists in Syria on Thursday announced that 120 296 people died.
There are 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, there are 29 954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18 678 executive warriors, and 187 armed forces from Lebanon's Hizbollah.
Among the dead, there are also 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of which are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100 000 people had died since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Asad's troops fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observer on Thursday stated that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The gods have undermined the danger that the scientists face for chemical weapons, who are in the middle of the ongoing civil war Syria to rid the chemical arsenal, must deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that his team is now “satisfied that he has verified - and followed destruction - the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling -
He added that “ currently no other control activities are planned -
Previously this week the inspectors said that they finished their first round of verification work when they visited 21 of 23 seats declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two places were ‘displaced and ... items of the chemical weapons programme which contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked’
It was not immediately clear whether the facilities in Safira were one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
\"I bow to the courage and courage you have shown in the fulfilment of this most demanding mission that this organisation has ever had,\" said the director of observer Ahmet Uzumc in his comment issued by the OPCW office.
Now, in his third year, he stands against himself in the civil war above all Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad’s government with its security forces, which are full of members of the Alavit sects, will multiply Shiite Islam.
As far as further development is concerned, the Head of Observations of Rami Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion inside the air defense device in the Syrian Coastal Province of Lazicija in the center.
He said the cause of the explosion wasn't known.
In its judgment of a bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and the 202 relatives who were killed in the bomb attack on Bali in 2002 responded strongly to the judgment raised above the last of the assistants who were built before justice, and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
The Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in South East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for putting together an explosive device that was used in a bomb attack.
In 15 years, he could be paroled.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in attacking two night clubs in the popular tourist area Kuta, where 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty at several other points of the prosecution associated with terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded life, although it could insist that a man with a nickname “Demolition Man” (bourch) due to his reputation as an expert for the production of explosives receive death penalty.
This decision reanimated the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who had lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny during the devastating attack launched by Patek and others.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP Mrs. Corteen, she said: “It should be built before the executioner’s reading.
Every day, I have to live with the fact that I don't see any other grandchildren and my daughter.
Sara's club was compared to the ground when she was on October 12, 2002 shortly after the 23rd hour of the fire a strong load located outside the parked van.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, the suicide bomber set off a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell to a coma for a month, and while being maintained in his life, three doctors “fired” three times.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jamá Islam responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imama Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death penalty like no one.
Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, he's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of more, it's not that bad.
Patek stood in front of the court as the last of the Atentians in Bali.
The arrest has been avoided for almost ten years, but in January 2011, he was caught in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the US forces killed the former leader Al-Qaeda Usama bin Laden for not more than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect between terrorist groups from South East Asia and Al-Qaeda.
“He did not volunteer,” said Mrs. Corteen.
Until now, he felt no regret for how much grief caused others.
Verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year, and to which they will belong the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
\"This year we will see a lot of tears,\" said Mrs. Corteen.
The patch can still appeal against the sentence.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological extracts on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of air companies will be able to use their electronic devices “from the gate to the gate - except for calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the patiently expected new rules, published by the Federal Air Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Travelers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
As soon as the change will be introduced, according to each airline, the FAA manager Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
The airlines will have to provide the FAA with the management of their aeroplanes with new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the deck crew and the installation directive to comply with the new rules.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over are Delta and JetBlue.
\"As a result of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic equipment very quickly,\" said FAA in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches 3 km high and the captain won't give up his permission.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane drops to land and does not turn them off until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and riding, FAA indicated.
The majority of new transport aircraft and other aircraft which have been modified so that passengers can use Wif at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stevard Association, welcomed the changes.
\"As soon as the new rules are safely implemented, and we will work closely with transport companies,\" said Glading.
To be honest, we are getting tired of looking like “the viewers. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and texts or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometres above sea level, said the Agency.
Passengers will be informed to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices into the air mode.
So still no Word with friends, the online game of scrabble, played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, fired from American Airlines aircraft, because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like laptops will still have to be stored because of fear that they might hurt anyone if they were flying around the cabin.
Cell phones will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for using mobile phones do not define FAA, but the US Federal Committee on Telecommunications.
FAA may cancel a ban on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosener from the State Security Committee on Transport, a national security expert in CBS News transport, said that mobile phones are still considered to be a risk.
“Mobil phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause interference in the broadcasting towers,” said the Roger.
The Board of Advisory established by the FAA administration to examine this problem last month suggested that the government allow wider use of electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure has been developed at FAA to mitigate their usage restrictions.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, a democratic from Missouri claim that there is no legal security reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to promote, as the use of such devices is in general.
Some studies suggest that when a third of passengers forgets or ignores the obligation to turn off their devices.
FAA began to limit the use of electronic passenger equipment in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radios, technical expenses of the time.
New airlines are much more exposed to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also constructed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have already offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at sea level.
Plans adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted under the new rules for the greater use of electronic equipment, said Huertová.
Current electronic devices generally reveal much less intense radio transmission than they were in previous generation facilities.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimum broadcasting when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
The Amazon.com is among those who are pressing to release the restrictions on the use of these passenger devices.
In 2011, representatives of this company submitted a transport aircraft with their electronic readers Kindle and carried out a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings as to whether they pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Passenger Association said that he believes the interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have declared that there are only constant reports from pilots that are intended to support the fact that such devices can cause interference of air systems and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to switch off devices during flying by means of low visibility devices.
The tourism industry has welcomed these changes and is in line with the rational procedure for the public, which uses technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that FAA has recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the American Travel Association.
The bird was aired from the drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was delivered to the coast after he was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into free nature.
One core was transported to Aberdeen last month after he had been treated by the Scottish SPCA company in a rescue resort until he recovered.
Colin Seddon’s operating centres said: “This man was probably migration from northern Europe when he caught a strong wind over the North Sea.
He seems to have lost his strength and his refuge on the oil platform.
Mr Seddon added: “It was not possible to fly again, so they contacted us with requests for help.
At the time of the baptism he was released, he was in good condition and well.
Is the European elite ready for the British trade?
The campaign Business for Britain (UK) was launched in April with the promise to combine enterprises and define what changes the EU wants to see in relation to British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we have carried out the biggest and most complex survey that we have asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing British companies with various sizes and from various sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be for many surprises.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export themselves outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are staging.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil to prevent the long and urgent process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas, from the monopoly regulations to the laws on products, most entrepreneurs expressed their view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market and businessmen said that the cost of Brussels regulation now outweighs the advantages of being part of the European trade area, even 40 percent of large enterprises, i.e. traditionally the most pro-European society.
Finally, our survey by the leaders revealed the most excruciating knowledge, although a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change its contract and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings identified by companies of different sizes and main business groups show that the business sector is pushing “ingenious change” to bring the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake - achieving changes in the Treaty and a better agreement for Britain can represent a profit of up to 16% in the EU vote in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to modernise the conditions of the British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain may be and, given how the euro area is set on its way for the economic and fiscal union, it is still more essential.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, this means re-focusing on trade and a major change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted: The spying went too far!
The United States has come to spying sometimes too far, according to AFP, the head of American diplomat John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
But, according to the Minister, he served as a rebuttal of terrorist attacks.
The first confession from Washington, according to the AFP, sounded in the middle of a sharp pole on both sides of the Atlantic due to the scandalous discovery of the mass monitoring of data by the American National Security Agency (NSA), whose target became American allies.
“In some cases, I admit, like the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure that this is not going to happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In his interview, however, he was primarily defending practice.
A collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent atents, such as attacks from 11 September 2001 in the USA, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.

Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era.
Launching the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
“Today we have witnessed the limit: the construction of the South Stream gas section started in Bulgaria, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream pipes should add diversity to Russian exports via Europe.
The agreement between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks linked to transit countries are ‘for all reasons’ is deleted.
As soon as the entire project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream gas at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that construction is to start at the end of this year in other countries.
Gas pipeline is designed for annual capacity of 2.2 trillion of crystal gas alloys.
Hizbollah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
They're going to be a decisive battle.
Lebanon's Hizbollah movement has placed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous area of Kalamun.
According to Israel’s constantly clarifying reports, during the Wednesday raids, two seats in Western Syria destroyed the rockets intended for Hizbollah.
This Lebanese Shia organization is fighting Syria on the side of the army.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which does not fit in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it will prevent the transfer of weapons to the hands of Hizbollah into Lebanon.
The reports on the Wednesday Israeli air raids on weapons warehouses in Western Syria are just specified.
Israel didn't comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American resources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com hit rockets fired from the Mediterranean Sea with Snúbar Djabel rocket base south of Latákíje.
The news station al-Arabíja claims that two warehouses were hit in which rockets were ready to move to Lebanon.
According to its resources, it was a rocket of the Russian production SA-8.
Israel's report refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizbollah with rockets and Syrian air force science teaches members of the armed section of Hizbollah with rockets.
SA-8 is an obsolete rocket that has been a Syrian army since the '80s.
They're on a moving chassis.
Although they are rather primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide.
They're equipped with radar, but after firing the missiles off, so it's hard to focus.
Latakíja lies in the western Syria, in the area covered by the rulings of the bottle.
It's a well-preserved area, and Hizboláh has been involved in fighting in Western Syria in the past.
They claim to help protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the alliances belong.
Now it's supposed to be 15,000 of his warriors ready to help conquer the army back in Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah there strengthens its troops, also the Syrian army.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest town of Homs.
The battle is supposed to be based on the sources of al-Arabíi's recovery for the recent attack of opposition to the commander of Syrian Shia Gryads abú Falla Abbas in the Shiathian part of Damascus.
Hisbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusajru have just gone to Kalamun.
In recent times, most citizens in the Czech Republic have had early elections.
Corruption, disbursements of money for the above-mentioned purchases and public contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the results of the elections, it can be said that most citizens have met this condition.
The fact that they did not mind and the state that was here (the stealing and debting of this state) were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters were not able to vote, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted for the ODS in total 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is a supernational majority.
When I added 1 016 829 ČSSD voters to the above mentioned parties, then with an old order (because all of these parties were involved in the ‘cut-off’ and the debt of this State), 64.23% of the right-hand voters agreed with this state.
In fact, the majority of voters have made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the guilty of stealing and overturning this state.
Or do you think the ČSSD members who were involved in this rule of law?
Is there ever a way to help us?

The Royal Commission found that two young men (YMCA)’s employees were charged before the action against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned that before the charges against child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011 were raised, two members of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children.
But before the commission, it was said that in their initial statement to the Commission, this association said that they had never solved the case of sexual abuse of the child in their organization.
The Executive Director of Phillip Hare was asked when he was one of the employees of the YMCA association accused of violations relating to child pornography, and on the other, when the gymist at Caringbah from the YMCA association was convicted in 1991 for the sexual harassment of the children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the board adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not the other one.
He admitted that the initial statement of YMCA was also inseparable when it claimed that the YMCA had carried out external audits which assessed this organisation as a pre-revenue of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that YMCA was pointed out that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and of the Society of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the lead from him had failed to go down when Mr. Lord had accepted without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to declare a breach of child safety rules.
In the past year, Lord was sentenced to sexual harassment of 12 boys, whom he committed in two years when he worked in the YMCA association.
He was arrested for at least six years.
However, Mr Hare refused to claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem which prevented the staff from reporting a child's safety breach by Mr Lord.
The staff members provided evidence that they were witnessing such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, self-guarded them, allowed them to sit on their laps, told them he liked them, and had them played with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the Lord’s subject and asked for training the safety of children because she was worried about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the Head of the YMCA Society of Caringbah, who was the Lord’s superior, was “very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him about something. ”
The Director-General said that he does not accept evidence of the staff that they felt unwittingly if they had to contact their superiors and report the works.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord has resulted in their judgment, and that is why they have not reported the problem.
Mr Hare said that the Board of YMCA in New South Wales gave its view that the lesson from “the case of Jonathan Lord” is in the organization’s view that “the staff had no report,” and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign an agreement on the preservation of silence shortly after the accusation occurred, he made the general manager for the services of children in YMCA Liam Whitley's organization.
He said that the aim was to avoid the distortion of evidence, but it was “aggravatedly hot, and misdirected.
The expert for sexual abuse of children Professor Stephen Smallblon of Griffin University said to the Commission that YMCA was not safe for children in New South Wales between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the recruitment, examination, processing, training and personnel management.
The hearing was postponed on December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would use a chance to return to the Prime Minister's post, but he admitted that the return was unlikely.
In the evening interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office of 59-year-old policy, he expressed his views on different areas of domestic policy.
From June 2007, when after ten years in the leading position, Mr Blair had mostly avoided talks about British policy and his comments on foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador of the Bízcod Peace Quarter.
When asked whether he would return to the Prime Minister’s post, his response to the Evening Standard newspaper was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it may be difficult to do so, so -
While in Cardiff the crowds of experts gathered to show horses to fight for the prize of the Horse of the Year, everyone was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Even though she doesn't go to school and only a few months ago, he made the first steps, this boy and his animal pet, the Shetland Ponie Toffee, were smoothly glided three rounds to finally get the main prize and leave 30 rollers with adult rivals behind.
This inseparable double - with the same height - was approved for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition of the Sunnybank riding centre in Rudry village near Cardiffu.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in the elegant hats, slipped his baret into a happy angle and let his two-year-old Toffee multiply around the circuit.
Fenton was honored by the judges for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got to his third birthday in March, and since then he's been practicing with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna (30) said: “Fenton and Toffee cooperate well together, ”
They didn't make much hope, but they finally left with their gold cup and flowers.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him phenomenal and completely foreign people wanted to take a picture of him.
A boy from Nantygl village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes in the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Hwells who runs horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere there, and everyone was encouraging and oxidizing.
He ran around the sand all the way through the arena, and although he was so small, he made a great performance.
Fenton is a obsessed animal - loves horses, tractors and farm and got two chickens in charge.
Because of how he started, he'll be back at the horse competition of the year, and I'm sure he'll do well.
Speakers of the annual horse showing competition said: “Fenton’s are only three, but he already knows how to control the pony.
He's making a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition course.
They always watch how good the team work between the ponie and who leads it, and Fenton and Toffeem were the best on the oval.
I'm sure the Fentons helped make some adorable clothes, and he really fell in there with him.
Too sighty newspapers are to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page requested the release of the reporter accused of speaking, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
The New Express News, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had received bribes to make up stories about the company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said that New Express News is now going to “full correction”
The “right” regulation came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and TV in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that, between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express News from the yangcheng Group of Evening News issued several false reports about Zoomlion.
“The New Express Editorial Head of the News was unsettled,” said the administrator in his statement.
He said that he had to decide “to deposit Chen Yongzhou’s administrative penalty in the form of a abolition of the journalistic licence,
In addition, “the yangcheng Evening News group ordered them to perform a general correction of the New Express list and recommended that they investigate the responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the lead of New Express,
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being held, his papers issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on state television and confessed to giving false stories for pay.
“In this case, I have caused the damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain confidence in the public,” he said at the CCTV State Intelligence Station.
I've done it mainly because I've spent money and glory.
I realize I did the wrong thing.
After an apology, Mr. Chen published a letter of New Express on the front page of the apology that said that he failed when he did not perform sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, a few careful suspects have made a confession on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly forced, regardless of the amendment of the law this year, which prohibits the authorities to force anyone to accuse themselves.
Found a tunnel for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico with its own ironing
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The American authorities described a tunnel about one times one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they've ever discovered.
Tunel, which clicks to the length of almost six football courses, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the USA.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses where you can easily hide trucks before being loaded with drugs.
The authorities said that the tunnel had been closed before it could have been undetected with drugs.
The authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of condemnation, they are faced with sentence of imprisonment from 10 years to after life.
In the town of Nogales in Arizona, smugglers penetrate into extensive drain channels.
Tunel is the eighth largest hallway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the Marihuans harvest in central Mexico, which builds a problem before the drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres long equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and Centres link management.
They offer, for example, common advertisers
The new integrated news industry Economics in Prague, Karlovy Vary.
Economia made a further step towards the transformation of the holding Centre into its media house.
Since Friday, Economy and the Centre have shared top management.
The uniting of the organisational structures and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing into the common media house, - comments the changes made by the Vice-President of the Economic Board and assigned to the Director-General Kamil Čermák.
The Čermák, who will be the head of the single management, will be completed by the Executive Director of the Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the trade was appointed Pavel Voplil, under the supervision of both Zuzana Tylèrová's Indian director.
Stephen Burd became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the department is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team is also the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was entrusted with the newly established function of marketing director.
A separate department of corporate communication is now in charge of the Lhotská Věra.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing has led Petra weak.
The new organizational structure will enable us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the production of the content of all the titles issued and, last but not least, to significantly improve the business management of the company, said Čermák.
Economia, owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakal, concluded a contract to buy the company Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
The portfolio of the Holdings Center consists of servers currently.cz, Women.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centre.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najist or portfolio of other nearly two dozens of smaller websites.

CME's gonna start on TV business.
He'll release nearly a quarter of people.
The CME media group will release.
By the end of the year, he wants to go down by a thousand people.
The Oskat intends all side activities and wants to focus on its main business, television broadcasts.
The group, which owns the Czech TV Nova and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs about 4 500 people.
That's how almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
The CME is part of the CET 21 which holds the license for broadcast television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the MTV music station.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the local TV one TV Nova is not yet clear.
“This is premature and we really cannot comment on it,” said the director of communication Nova Josef Koukokleček.
According to information from MF DNES, significant releases of the Czech Republic will certainly not go away, but this should have far the greatest impact on CME personnel states in Romania and other countries.
Both the new chiefs of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after the long-term director Adrian Sarbu, during the Wednesday conference call with analysts spoke about wanting to limit all activities that were directly unrelated to television business.
It is therefore likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, film and production activities.
In the industrial complex ČKD in Prague burned down in the night of the cooling tower
In the ČKD industrial complex in Prague, a large storage tank was burned, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
“On Thursday morning, the fire was set up by fire, ” said Pavlína Adamc, a spokesperson of Prague firefighters.
The amount of damage in the area by measurement did not exceed the limits allowed.
The damage and cause of the fire are unknown so far.
About five dozens of firefighters gradually arrived at the premises in Kolbenov Street.
“One about the fire of a large-scale storage tank, probably a cooling tower, ” said Adamc.
“In the complex there is no functional hydrant network, therefore, we have to hang out by means of a transport line from the tank,” she added.
According to tn.cz server, the firearms had to adjust the hydrant network, therefore, the firefighters had to fix the evaporated water.
The fire department reported a second level of fire alarm.
It's a total of four, with the most serious situations being declared fourth.
Chemicals went to the scene to verify the degree of dangerous substances that could have gotten into the air in the fire.
However, they did not measure the amount of damage in the air that would exceed the hygiene standards,” said the firefighters.
The British police delivered Assange's release notice
The British police today delivered a statement on the release of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that 40-year-old Australian had “announced the release,” with the request for him to be put at the police station and that if he did not do so, he could threaten his arrest.
Assange, under the British law, has exhausted his possibilities when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal against the issue this month, facing the release to Sweden because of sexual crimes charges.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would release him to the United States, he would seek refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where this South American country asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard “destructed a 40-year-old man to attend the police station on the day and the hour he was designated,” said the spokesperson.
Assange continues to break bail conditions.
The embassy refused to submit a commentary notice.
Assange is afraid that he will be released from Sweden to the United States where he can face spy charges because WikiLeaks published 250 000 US diplomatic documents on the website.

As a result of the taxes on owners of foreign real estate, the Indian bubble of Prague
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally issued a tax on the return of financial assets, but awaits the final decision by Mr Osborn, which in the 2012 budget presented a 7 % fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings worth over 2 million pounds and annual fees for buyers who own their properties within the company, not as individuals.
The payment for the transfer of real estate in the Westminster and Kensington districts and Chelsea, which in the 2012/13 tax year reached £708 million, already exceeds the total sum for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Severozpad and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “With regard to the increase in real estate transfer at home, high values and performances related to legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high value is very low, regardless of the effect of the obsolete system of taxation on the head,
He added that “this step could have been caused by some foreign investors to afford to buy in London, or that the existing owners were unable to sell themselves“
Real estate front - top 5 % to 10% of the housing market according to price - in a rich strip that runs from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11.8% in last year.
Prices in the middle of London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year, but they have been encircling “home market” on which, according to the survey of Savils' real estate office, the south-west, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) of the increase.
Scientists explained how the movement of the tail is related to the mood of the dog
Previous research showed that happy dogs drilling with more transport (from the look of the dog), while nervous dogs have tail mainly left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can record and respond to these fine differences in the movement of the tail.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent said: “In people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have a different bond of motives that stimulate positive or negative emotions.
We've been trying to spot the same with other species.
He added that, as in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-hand movements and vice versa and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an attempt to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate drilling of tails of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that followed films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analysed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tail is going on one side at a time, and another time to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have been discussing dog videos about dogs - whether in natural version or in the form of silutes - in order to rid ourselves of any confusing suggestions, and we have also managed to adjust the movement of the tail and represent it more right or left -
When the animals saw a different unexplained dog moving by the right tail (from the sight of a dog drilling tail), she remained completely calm.
But when she recorded the production of tail mainly left (renew from the look of a dog drilling tail), their heart rate increased and the animals worked insecure.
Professor Vallortigar said he didn't think dogs would communicate well through these movements.
Rather, they think that dogs have learned from the experience that moves must and do not have to be careful about.
He said: “If you meet the dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly connected with friendly behavior and the movement of the transport produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience.
Researchers say that findings can help dogs, vets and trainers to understand their animal emotions better.
An expert on dogs John Bradshaw, a college teacher at the University of Bristol, said it wasn't the first study to examine whether it was left and right side for dogs important.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their head back on the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another professional treat from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dog work with dogs was more likely to be seen when he wrinkled the tail left than the right when they were more uncertain, in contrast to the Italian study.
The difference may be given according to him by the fact that dogs in these various studies of animals in films or dog robots did not make out entirely as dogs.
He explained that she could help study on how dogs react to real dogs.
“ Although, in the case of many different mammals, there are reasonable evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it will probably not take long to understand why their tail is going on one side and another on the other side.

Pope Francis named the first Cardinal in February
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis, on 22 February, first called the new Cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The Cardinals have the highest position in the church of the Catholic Church immediately after the Pope and are those who elect the Pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
Now it's 201 Cardinals.
As soon as the Cardinal reaches the age of 80, however, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope, so the group is reduced to 120 elective Cardinals.
In the statement declaring this report, the fifth Federico Lombardi, the spokesperson of Vatican, said that before the official promotion of the new Cardinals, a meeting of the current Cardinals known as the Consistrium will take place.
“The Franz decided to call the February Consistrium in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings, which require the participation of Cardinals from different parts of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of elective Cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He said that the Pope usually calls as many Cardinals as it is necessary to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and so many Cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The constorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March this year, he said Valero.
At this point, there is a certain focus on Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope is nominated for Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of Cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of Cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world, which he has given the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
“Now Francis chose these eight Cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that it was “a doela possible, that these Cardinals of the Pope would ask for counsel.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's completely news.
Valero said that the Popes traditionally increased to the rank of Cardinals Bishops from the great places, but Francis is “a complete surprise - so we don’t know who he calls“
GM downloades some new light trucks in the USA due to the repair of seat restraints
According to the Friday notice from the US car safety authority General Motors, almost 12,000 new cars (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra are being downloaded to repair the failure with manual loading of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism of loading the front load seats may be.
As a result, seat restraints are not consistent with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
Notice located on the State Road Safety Administration website (NHTSA) says that “if the car from behind gets hit, the head restraint may not protect the passengers correctly, which increases the risk of injury -
The latest models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
GM introduced the supply to the market in June and for this leading American car is the most important marketing of the vehicle from the restructuring to the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the defect delivery in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the claims of owners due to the 16-day dysfunction of the government, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra deliveries, which were reworked for the 2014 models, increased over the first 10 months of this year to about 20 percent, declared GM on Friday.
In October GM sold out of its supplies 42 660 models Silverado and 16 503 models Sierra.
The shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.

It is called \"The Audacity to Win\" (Trufast to win) and it is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient's judgment tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to the time that politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath.
The elections ended with a bold advantage and television intelligence forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents hid the papers they got.
A young group of visionaries headed into the White House and the nation was ready to change.
During the introduction into the Office in 2008 Obama had 82 percent of the support.
And I close this book.
To go to this day is a rough wake, like talking out of sleep.
It is hard to remember these optimistic days - they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
In years after I threw my first election ticket, it actually changed.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes - from the law on the available care to remove our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “Do not ask, do not say anything - after the death of Usama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that party obstructions have reversed so much efforts to move our nation forward: among other things it is immigration reform, the possibility of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantanam.
But after many situations where I have been defending Obama's administration from colleagues and friends, I am, as far as the explanation that they can provide, I have reached an absolute limit.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
The services of the Republican cannot explain the consent of listening to foreign leaders or to airless aircraft killing innocent children in overseas.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data about American private life, or that it pursues those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be executed responsible for execution by Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without a proper court, nor by restricting public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
They cannot be justified by finding a report that says that the attempts of the White House to silence the media are “a more aggressive... from the Nexon administration -
And most recently, they can't apologize to the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of the simple website.
I don't know if something like this could be expected.
Whether in 18 years I should have known that government powers could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded her.
Apparently, the Volunteer has no predictable course, and our public interviews will form an opposition political party and an event such as a Massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples I have set out above seem to be the result of my own administration decision.
And that's what's bothering me most.
I chose both again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbroken alternative, and it seemed that he could not strengthen his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hope we once heard of.
Still, there is a return to 2008 - with Obama's support falling below 45% this week - through this book more and more difficult.
They're making me remember that many promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter about Obama's primates in Pennsylvania suffered a rough defeat with Clinton.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to pace and remain faithful to his mission.
“I want our magic back,” he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave programme
Billionary and Member of Clive Palmer says that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Danish magnate, which disputes the payment of a carbon tax ratio of $6 million, made this claim when he tried to look at the question from the table whether he was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's Single Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to choose carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer claimed that there could only be ministers in conflict of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have benefited from the policy.
“He has come to a great conflict of interest regarding a paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters had been pregnant, he should be directly interested in having a parental leave,” said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the vote of the election committee following the recountment of the votes, Mr. Palmer officially declared the winner of the fight for the Fairfax chair in the Sunshine Coast area thanks to the profit of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget's daughters.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the electoral rooms?
“We must have a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap details on the computer, vote immediately and get results at 6:30 in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to label voting leaves.
Is it true that the results can be removed if they don't like anyone?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems to be incredible.
The election committee studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the airport in the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new job “very serious”:
Public service is public.
“We do not seek any reward except that we can serve society in this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have come to the conclusion that they wash hands for you and for you.
The experiment was attended by 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were responsible for dealing with an incorruptible role.
Of course, both failed.
But a group who washed her hands in vain was a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group, with its arms washed, was better than the other one in the next test.
Yet those who washed their hands had worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of the errors were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not notice any previous failures.
According to the psychologists, the results show that physical purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivations fall, testing must focus much more in other tests.
If we'd transferred the results of research to Bohemia, we'd probably be the most optimistic person to come back from the toilet.
After the use of the toilet, only one percent of the Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but on the way to the city transport it is five.
The hygiene also lies mostly after work in the garden or in the workshop where the hands wash 85 percent of people.
The domestic pet's absorption motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, however it is necessary to wash hands after hand is given to a foreign person.
In this situation, our hands will wash 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of the Slovaks.
He showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
“Although it would be on site, I fear that reality is different and people are trying to do a little better,” she commented on the results of the study of the skin doctor Klaus Komárková.
RBS suspended two traders with foreign currency
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RCS) has two traders in its division with foreign currency, which is another sign that global investigations by the control authorities concerning suspicious currency market machinery are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with competent authorities in investigating the largest financial market in the world, where every day the owners of USD 5.3 billions change every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the context of an extended investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR manipulation scandal (long-term interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment, but confirmed that it received information from the authorities this month.
“Our uninhabitable search in this matter continues, and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other authorities,” declared the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event said that the RBS forwarded to the British Financial Behavior Authority the records of e-mails and rapid reports sent from accounts and to the former trader's accounts.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010, and is expected to have been released from his current position as European President of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Chairman of the Trade for Cash Money in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former Head of Market for Currency in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Charter this week.
Neither one of these traders was accused of any misdemeanor.
Mr. Usher's group for sending quick reports was owned by bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, and people dedicated to this event.
The Bank of UBS stated this week that after the Swiss control authority notified Finma that it was investigating suspect machination in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, she took steps against some of her employees.
At least six authorities in the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss anti-monopolic Office of Weko, FCA, the U.S. Justice Ministry and the Hong Kong Monetary Office - examines the claim that these bankers have committed themselves to moving with the monetary market.
In addition, the information request was received from the competent authorities from HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse.
Banks are asking for years with quick reports and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have been alarmed by traders in the area which was one of the largest engines to create profits in investment banks' bonds in the past years, but which has been breached by the fact that small stability of the currency has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they claimed that with a large and high liquidity market with foreign currency, it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but the high positions of traders say that it does not necessarily have to be true.
Despite the large volume of daily trade with foreign currency liquidity spread between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, the high builder said that, \"You can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices,
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released its share trading department this week, which caused almost USD 6 million to lose by the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperated with their inspection bodies.
“We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague is over 1,000.
Doctors in Prague have already reported more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the follow-up in 1986 until the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the disease in total 1005 people from the metropolis.
It's coming out of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,63 infected were still in the Czech Republic.
Immunity failure in 396 already broke out.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic is growing annually in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later they were 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 then 180.
The previous number fell to 153 last year but was record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
“The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, I think there is no doubt,” my expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavátý, who led the Prague House of Light to patients.
From October to the end of 2011 the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavátý.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has been pumped in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected was in Prague.
Who really wants to know some city should be fixed to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk away from a national center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would have revealed a crater.
Many people read from graves.
They slow down the cemetery and gain an intimate insight into local reality.
They find out which people live here, what nationalities, such as faith, to how large and coherent families belong, at what age they are dying here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were.
In what way they express their social status as their taste.
And they will learn from the condition of the graves how they take care of their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Law on Health Care
The Supreme Court in the United States has decided that the Law on Health Care signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, which is a major victory for Obama's administration.
At 5:4 the Court decided that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and the available care that citizens require to purchase health insurance by 2014 or otherwise threaten them to pay fines - does not support the Constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
President John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in the opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the Act on 2700 pages and decided that the legal requirement for health care which calls for the States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, in the opposite case, to the need for all financing of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not forced and contrary to the Institute.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have submitted a complaint to block this law.
During the 2012 primer, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the expected proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words “Mugabe is a spherical donkey, no longer threats to prison, the law has been cancelled by the court
Until now, the Zimbabwads had to pay good care for the public talking about the nine - year - old Mugab, who ruled the country since the early 1980s, has been standing in its forehead since the end of 1987.
In accordance with paragraph 33 of the criminal law, the presidential office has threatened 100 dollars a year to withdraw freedom.
The representatives of the state should not strongly accuse people who comment on the President in pubs or other public places, - declared representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine judges agree unanimously that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal against the court's decision, inform British BBC.
A number of damaged Zimbabwans, between them Tendai Dang, which the police arrested two years ago for a alleged insult to the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist in the public of Mugabe ended up in prison with a gift-circulatory donkey.
Then in August, the prosecutor accused a six-year-old man because of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The Court also declared it contrary to the law restricting the freedom of the media.
“The state cannot punish people whose statement later shows itself as unrighteous,” said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Mallal.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law allowed the person who published false information to be sentenced to twenty years of jail.
“Existence of the law to criminalize someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to speak freely,” said Malala.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with hard hands for over 33 years, it has been adopted in Zimbabwe in March on the basis of a referendum of a new constitution with wider civil freedoms.
Small steps towards the dictatorship of one man of the country took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition took place in the prime chair of Morgan Tsvangiray.
However, the Earth continues to suffer the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009 the government completely cancelled the national currency.
Today, only currencies of other states apply in Zimbabwe.
The incentive economy is going to Mugabe's unsustainable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he divided the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them had no experience with the course of Pharaoh.
Central banks maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument to allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need.
The banks put it in their joint statement.
“It is a very reasonable step,” commented Julian Callow, the main international economy of Barclays, in London.
“For the time being, all the transitional instruments of this type have become permanent, so it is not my surprise,” adds Vojtěch Benda, the main economy BH Securityes.
Central bankers strengthen the bond that began to occur in 2007, when the international credit market first collapsed.
The central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
Central bankers' decision comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its US economy support programme, which could offset the cost of money on the global market even higher.
The contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency in the current liquidity surplus of another currency.
It can be understood as a component of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB shall launch a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, and the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
As Tipsport (no) has personal data.
More than a year ago, I was registered at Tipsport.cz website.
But then I didn't finish this because someone on the branch just sat there who couldn't complete the registration on the internet.
And since I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration went down, then I moved, and it changed my address and civil ID number.
When I wanted to sign up later, I was told that it was impossible because I have another OP number, the address and that it just didn't finish it, and that I should ask for a new data deletion and run a new registration.
That's what I did and 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I would ask to delete all my personal data from the database under the applicable law on the protection of personal data.
For that, she wrote me a long day technical support that I should register to complete the branch.
This started the maraton of e-mails for technical support, which eventually after 4th urgance 25.10., they wrote that they deleted personal data on my request.
So you would think that he could make a new registration, and here the problems began first, it was written to me that my user name was already occupied (it was not deleted - it was not personal data, but it was also disabled).
So I used another user name and jumped on me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration on the branch (how could they have stored something that they claim to be erased?), so I contacted technical support again.
On my question, how can it be written to me that the personal data actually erased 25.10. and to send an e-mail with the error.
That's what I did (a.k.a. 15 hours) and today they wrote to me that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) in 13.22 and that's why it's impossible because I used the same name and date of birth.
How about I contact technical support for a week and deal with them that it's still impossible.
And what if the truth was (as it is not) could not be registered with the same name or date of birth if it was already registered).
Just by the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a thought-out e-mail and phone number and the world of wonders, it appeared to me a page that they sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport imports registration to e-mail and phone number, and the data just didn't dial out as he claims.
So once again, I have granted this technical support that they simply lie (or know what they write) because what they write is not true.
I added a few screens that the registration problem was before 31.10. So, “false registration” simply does not affect this.
That's what Tipsport wrote me a string of sentences - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claims.
And he ended the communication.
Thespective repeats the same sentence that the registration refers to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in an e-mail, and it didn't actually work.
So if I sum it up, not only did Tipsport not delete the data as he claims, but he still lies when he says otherwise.
The worse it is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like a mistake is on the customer's side.
After the introduction of this matter on my personal blog, things got a little moving and the Technical Support came up with an e-mail that the matter was transmitted to the investigation and I would be informed (after the week of determination and assessment and notification of the same error).
In the subway on the Bridge, music plays
Prague (DPP) has launched the Music Project in the subway.
The first vestibul, where the metro continues to play reproduced instrumental music during operation, is Bridge line A on exit at Václav Square.
The test operation will last six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new doubled album, band and three singers
Michal Horáček brought his completely new two-CD Czech calendar into the hall of Cologne, but above all in the series between us singers Lenka Novou, František segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by excellent Orchestrem Matěje Benka.
After an initial intrusion and acting ethics about the late musician gradually invited Michal Horáček to the stage all three singers, himself came up with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they played in Kolín and in the theatre and the entire city had fallen out of electric current.
“Jinak in Cologne produced two kinds of cards that I had come into contact with,” he recalled.
He also reminded President Zeman's parents anyway.
“We might be able to make a tour of the Coals or the Dúbravec near Bratislava,” he said.
A few times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage, and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
Josef Mánes, who gave it to the eagle, did not know about ice hockey at that time, but he did not know how to meet at these squares and scandalize who did not jump, there is no Czech Republic.
That's the name of one song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today,\" he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, but from this board he sang for him very good sleep on the day, singing on his nights and accompanying him on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band in keyboard composition, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists, together, sang a little break-in to the bottom of their heart, sit down, and then spread the auditorium.
“I’m glad that the song was interesting to you, which did not surprise me in Kmoch’s town,” Michal Horáček responded.
After a memory of Peter Hapk, I was reminded of Francis segrad's composition, in the original of Richard Müller, awarded by a huge alaus, Hanu Heger again reminded Dad had also liked Lisa Baar's statement about the communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer, Michael Kocába, reminded Sebastián, then the Segrado sang a wonderful composition of Prague, a maimed by Jarda Svoboda, a sadist and former Kolinak.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in standings and additions in the form of optimistic compositions we live in a wonderful time.
There was one more addition on the playlist, but the fans no longer made out.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire reader sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover from the legendary LPG, and with any interest in taking a picture.
Berdych and Štěpánek will complete Rosol and Hajek
At the finale of Davis' Cup against Serbia he was nominated by the unplaying captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav returned to the Czech Republic Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Luke Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech trophies defend trophies, but they are going to play on the field of opponents to the Whitegrad arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The finals are the third time in the last five years.
“We know that we are going to the hot ground, that it will be wild and we must, as always, focus on our performance -
“We will go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best,” said Štěpánek, the uncle of the winning point in last year’s finale with Spain.
Secret War: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how it's supposed to bomb Syria.
America's command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf of Persia.
The Israelis have just demonstrated how Syria's bombing should look.
Without unnecessary lobster, threats, and millions of statements sent off the plane, they hit the target and returned.
Without derailing the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire event and they are no longer expressing themselves to it.
The exact opposite of confused and large, acts uncircumcised by Obama's Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying of the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be confused by the media by their claims that the ‘Syria base’ was bombed, or ‘the supply for Hizbalah’ was bombed.
I recently wrote here that while the US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical plane, Russia is happy to continue to deliver the weapons of Syria.
And just a fresh delivery of Russian rockets located at Latákija port became the target of Israel's raid.
That's a good message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed Assad’s regime, not the rebels, although it should be the opposite of popular online theories.
The U.S. government has reported two members of the sleeping unit, probably Delta Force.
They had no idea yet that they were exposed to an American consulate in Bengali during the attack.
It is known to be the heroic death of two former SEALs, who defend the CIA area in town, I think it was a member of the CIA secret command that was formed by former soldiers.
It has long been speculating what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere in the CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has in Libya its office protected by bulletproof nests (just on one of the two members of the SEALs have perished after a minemet intervention), is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two unknown heroes.
They were part of the American command in Tripoli, and as soon as they got a report on the attack in Bengáza, they volunteered to intervene and together with five private contractors shot their way to the CIA complex in Bengaz.
The Obama administration congratulates the fact that during the attack, the commander was not officially established and all and that it simply hesitated to do.
Commander of Command, without orders, he'll probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, it's not a one-time job in the country, but a permanent US command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And that's because, until recently, there's been no such confessions, and now they're talking about just some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the United States, even though half of it is trying to punish terrorism in Libya.
Although it would be more helpful to resolve the national situation.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media had almost provoked Iran's air force for extortioning American drones.
However, little is known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in the airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
However, if Iran’s drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian aircraft F-4 Phanto followed the American drone in the international space above the sea, when it may have been the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew up the Phantom to optically verify his weapons without registering him on the radar, or he just noticed it, and then suddenly when he showed up at his place and called for Iran's pilot to return home, he listened without a whispering.
There's nothing to be surprised when Phantom is an American production aircraft, but he remembers a war in Vietnam.
Raptor can't compare himself.
We want to show that Plzen still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful recently, the defender or supporter Viktorie Plzen František Rajtoral has the form that brought him back to represent after a year.
He's also good at shooting, he's moving through activity, and he's got a ticket kick on him in the heat.
Viktoria sat on the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end, one point was taken from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an awkward series with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
“I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home, ” promises František Rajtoral.
Manhood prepares for a hard game with the Severoches who play the attack football.
It's all about playing with Jablonec, the coach's doing us good, as we always draw a lot from the video game opponent.
“I believe it will be a great game on Friday night,” says the Czech representative of fans at Doosan Aren Tribun.
Out of the last fights, they didn't go as she wished, but the word of the crisis is rejected by Viktorie's defender.
That's how football goes, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
“I believe we will win Friday and it will be good again,” my defender of the West.
The Victoria Manship will rely again on supporting fans.
I would like to invite our fans who are great.
“I believe that we will repay them with a defeat,” says Rajtoral.
John Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step away, but a big jump back a few years, and it's a memory, to my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, clean up and do the homework.
Even though these “acquisitions” were mostly just theories, parents’ wishes.
Praxe was completely different - get out of school, throw a bag in the corner and run out.
Play with other kids ball games, jump shots.
Then, on Helena and her boys' show, she's going to sew on a chain stitch with a festivities for grandma's birthday.
And then after a few warnings, wash the dishes, fill the wood in winter into the tiles stones and tasks to do until after dark under the lamp (or rely on the coworker and instead of the tasks to write in love with the verses addressed by school love).
In the morning, to eat homemade strawberry marmalade (from real fruit, not the ones that are sold now, whose contents are not lying next to the strawberry) and to drink the tea of the dried herbs that my mom and I liked to collect.
I also remember those magic evenings when the grave silence was in the room when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tape, which were loudly shot in the old tapemaker's mom.
And then on the pencil, we'd turn the tapes over and let each other do one of the same songs, our favorite, and they'd drink with a siphon.
Or we've been on the phone over the table using backpacks that were tied to each other by a string - and when we're already on the phone to hear better, it's necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the other ear was a match and a bag.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live out of it so we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPads, iPads, even phones and notebooks or brand clothes.
The dress was inherited from generation to generation and the best-circumcised - the bagiated domestic production T-shirt was made using SAVA.
From electronics, we have enough to be satisfied with the above-mentioned mom's tape recorder and at most so Walkman, who we shared with our sister, and which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We came to play more interesting with Aunt Kloboučka Hop or a man, do not be angry, or as I said, \"just out.\"
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure my parents had a long time saving him, but unfortunately he didn't stay warm for a long time.
My younger sister put a girdle in him, said he was so beautiful, and he did try to see if he was sleeping and smothering.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, he's got this incident today, poor man, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she was stuck in the video and she thought she was playing a recipe and didn't play it, which is why she can't make it.
I remember how we all got together to communicate, talk without a cell phone, computers.
Together with my sister, we agreed on holidays with my grandmother's granddaughter when we meet again next summer at the grandmother's house - and so it was, so it paid.
We met.
Promise someone you'll see in a year?
I also remember the winter when we used to run outside with the village, build snowmen, ride a snowy hill near the church on the sacks of haystacks.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we heard from our sister before each dinner the notorically known sentence: ‘Let your hands be washed. ’
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have an attached soap in the bathroom in the lemon net.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage - at a beer with Jarda from the village, we were lying with my mom on the floor, leaning on the legs about the tiles stone, opening the door and staring at the flames and listening to the cracking of the wood that came from the stone roped.
We were closer - really - we didn't expect how many friends on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write notes every day over various cabins, texts.
There was nothing like this, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at albums, where they are clearly marked with black horns, created by black and white photographs.
And if I don't happen to know what it was like back then, the photo is always written a year of shooting.
I'm looking forward to the fact that although we didn't have a lot of hair cut according to the pot, and we had pants for the cousin's two numbers larger, no one used to laugh at us before, it was so normal (not the IN).
And I'd better get back on that step ahead of you to reality.
Until 2013, and I'll wait for the modern time to come up once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories are, for a young teen generation, at least somewhere--for years behind a monkey -- and I think they are a lot lost that this - the first time is not going to experience.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are sued for Nortel patents
Nortel’s own patents group filed a complaint against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, a company that was overruled by Nortel’s bankruptcy auction.
In the U.S. District Court in Texas, Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and other four companies for breaking patents.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google's charged with a violation of seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps to combine expressions that are sought on the Internet with the advertising in question, presents an action, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately in contact.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on Google Android's operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google made a starting price offer of USD 900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to 4.4 billion USD.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the fight for patents, Google won $2.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, which was a trade motivated by part of Motorola patents.
“In spite of the failure to acquire patents that are subject to the dispute, Google patents have infringed and continue to breach,” says the action.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because Google intends to violate its patent deliberately, as the action claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
The outside came from 4 degrees Celsia, which we're not used to.
At first, she took away her smile, the one that kept putting the reflection as a defense in front of the pleasures of the friendly surroundings.
She was very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put in public.
He was only being honest at home the days she was having grandmas around her grandkids, Elinka or Adek.
And of course, when her sons were on the phone.
She remembered the lesson from endless trade skills courses.
Now they're really good at it.
To keep her closest.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like a costume for masquerade.
November, not another month can do the miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt refers to the office of the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day will hardly end political concern in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised “New Egypt“ when he was solemnly assigned to the office as the first elected President of this country, after Husní Mubárak, who was established 16 months earlier.
At its introduction to the Office before the High Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the state since the collapse of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges sent to black talars in a seat built with a view to the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are seeking better tomorrows, new Egypt and the second republic,” said Mursi during the ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today established the foundation of a new life, absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60 - year - old engineer trained in the U.S. and a member of the Muslim fraternity, a fundamentalist group, which has been for most 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization of the terror attack of individual governments.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 hours of local time in a small colony of cars, hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the court building to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential demonstrations of Mubarak's period, the transport was only shortly stopped so that the colony could travel normally through a busy path connecting the city centre with suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, mocked as an unattractive “reservable tire, Muslim fraternity, has greatly grown from his victory and his fifth speech, which was intended to present him not only as an Islamic candidate, but also to all those who want to lead to the end of the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursi, a blue social suit with a red tie to the judges in a wooden chamber where he made an oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to present an inaugural speech.
While standing in sight, he got an official welcome from a military band that played national anthem.
Commandant was the military commander of the field marshal Husajn Tantava.
His arrival was accompanied by a scandal “armada and people are one hand - from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre for secular education and later in the 1970s it became a fairy tale of Islamic student movements.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday at the Tahrir Square, in a place where the revolution was born which ended last year by the authoritarian government of Mubárak, and solemnly promised that he would once again grasp the presidential powers taken by his office by the military council, which took them from the deserted leader.
But by consenting to the official oath before the trial, rather than before the parliament, as it is customary, he has chosen the will of the army, which suggests that the fight for power will continue.
Mursi's speech in the Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There's probably police specialists in the ghettos, and they're supposed to ease the tension.
In ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should be involved in the future.
They'd spend half their meals here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Their knowledge of the environment should contribute to reducing the tension between the people of the poor and the inhabitants of the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior counts.
According to him, an improvement in the situation in the country would help mainly to ensure social housing,
The government has discussed the document.
According to analysis, around 300 poor houses and quarters were available in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
It lived in them for 80,000 people, especially Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in special schools.
She was flattering.
According to the experts of the problem sites, there have been a hundred in the meantime.
The relationship between their inhabitants and others is depleted.
In several places, anti-Roman marches were held.
Extremists were also associated with people from the area.
According to the interior, police are demanding in the areas of safety ghettos and order to keep.
The fundamental condition is the consistent application of equal access to enforcement;
However, he said that without detailed knowledge of the place and people it is impossible to achieve.
A specialist would go out to walk in a ghetto where he would spend half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a problem site, he'd be watching order.
He would also know locals, so he could deal with better problems or barriers.
“Thanks to the trusted trusts, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a number of infringements,” said the interior.
Specialists in ghettos would receive a contribution of 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be borne from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about €600,000 (now about €15,5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of totals, funds 85 percent.
The preparations started this year, now processing a detailed proposal.
The project is to continue until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
“There are so-called Roma settlements,” said the authors of the report.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis which will determine where a special officer would need to be.
It will also depend on how much money will be released by the police after the project is completed every year.
According to the design of the project, first selected policemen attend an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen people should go through this training year.
They're going to be the most suitable candidates.
Special education should also be developed for police officers who will operate in ghettos.
According to authors, the situation would help to improve social housing.
It is said that it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the impression that the interior would have three categories.
Minimum standard would meet hostels with well-defined rules such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards should social housings that are comparable to ordinary housing.
Contractors would have to implement an integration plan to draw up social workers with them.
They would have to follow the accommodation order, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would proceed to a higher standard of housing.
The housing system should work for at least 30 years according to the interior until another generation grows up in an integrated environment.
The social housing model is preparing resorts for local development and work.
They're supposed to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The coal hill is an excellent hill of 3 km south of Brunthal.
Together with several others, it is a proof of a dangerous activity in the Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were still at the beginning of the quarter.
When looking from far away, on the top of the Uhlířský hill, the impressive white of the baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Secondary, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden cuff chapel.
The man standing next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after completion of the church, an alley was set out of four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The crossroad on the top of Uhlířský is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
On fifteen stops there are wooden plastics made by the local art butcher František Nemmlel.
He used different types of wood from the Low Jesenik area.
Similarly, the buildings of the mountain from this region form an interesting geological exhibition.
The name of the sponsor shall also be given to each stop.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
Although the data from radiometric measurements vary somewhat, the last August here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is then younger than the Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years old) and older than Venuš's volcano (over 0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born an explosion.
It designed a large amount of pine ash, along with the fragments of the rock from the substrates which were fired by the burnings, obtained by red brown color.
At the end of this phase, it ran out to the surface of the lion - today it is the layer of the pedigree of up to 13 meters strong.
The second erraupce threw out red, browned and places up to black tufs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters high, and its part is accessible in a rock wall.
There's a 1-metre pine puma in the tufech. And the second erupce was closed with a bottle relief.
At the end of the activity of the volcano, a lava that is now forming up to 50 m thick layer of the spherical flock.
The volcanoes in which the decommissioning of the pine ash with the flow of the lava are the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name of the stratoovulcane.
The original pine stake was gradually subjected to the erosion.
But he was threatened until the mining of the rock on the south side on the south side.
The most intense mining here took place in 1953 - 1962.
Tufs were added to concrete that was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The burden was managed under pressure from experts and the public to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem is, however, in porosity and low cohesion of the mountains that quickly roam, they fall apart and fall down on the slope.
Lom is getting away so fast.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, it is warm, south-oriented, ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Thus, it is problematic, but it will take time to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's not new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
On the top you can reach the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Slezský Kočov.
Automoblists can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lip alley, where a short teaching path begins.
From the villa she moved to the panel room.
Ivana grew up and spent more of her life in an activable villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas on the Orzechovka.
But the original owners of the house obtained it back in the restitution, and the tenants had to move out with a small distance.
Ivana therefore quickly sought a replacement for herself and his older mother.
From the known, she got a tip on apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
“It was a shock first, but the view from the fourth floor of a large forest park and the dam overturned me on the other side,” recalls Ivana’s first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a commission for three years.
“Today we live here for more than thirteen years and not only for gradual reconstruction I would not change,” adds the owner.
Mother and daughter then moved from a hundred-inch apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not simple, things were stored with friends and progressive arrangements lasted almost a year.
New apartment was in quite good condition, but they had to make necessary adjustments, such as door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner broke out the core, but the owner most misdirected and unnecessaryly large hallway, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms was created by a multifunctional living space.
Architects have been used for the definition of individual zones and the separation of the sdarkarton room, which allows new location of the lights.
The first intervention that she agreed to after a few years was to remove the yarn in the living room.
This apartment changed to 2 + kk, but the room gained air conditioning and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC floor for laminate.
Ivana didn't know about the bathroom.
I've been picking up housing magazines for years looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I addressed the young architect Kamil Doudděr on the recommendation.
“It was actually the most important step in the future,” says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom it was also possible to adjust even the room.
The architect combined the room of toilet and bathrooms and two doors with open wings replaced one with a sliding, which saved the place.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently colourless.
The quality covers imitating sandstones, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, with a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamilou Doudir continued.
Under the show How a dream was built, but a fundamental change in the living room, which was also attended by architect Martin Čenek.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping without helping the classic principles of optical separation, the purchase of semiconductor or Japanese walls.
“This would result in a breach of the openness and unity of the space,” explains the architect.
The sleeping and living area were originally separated.
It was enough to turn your back on each other two sofas and put them between them in a peaceful cabinet made on the feathers.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door resurfaced the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, hides the sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor from the antiallergic marmolea has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate laminates: soft soft surface without a pair and better sound insulation.
The system of ecclesiastes and insights from the sárkarton color highlighted is an example of how you can work with the space in the panel.
I left the colors on architects, I wished it was happy.
\"I like orange, I also had the same shade in my previous apartment,\" says Ivana.
The plot from the graphic sector with the theme of a flourishing magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone the architects chose a white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it managed to save books, among other things, to the area under the window parapets.
Everything is within range, the lamps are comfortable to control the distance.
In a divided interior, there is an excellent contrast between the new one and the older one, for example with dozens of years old crystal mirror and high-quality artistic objects that Ivana collects her entire life.
The last one came up with a kitchen.
The boxes were previously distributed on both sides and the owner looked a little bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and rescheduled the location.
The furniture in a simple design is made on the contract, the white area makes it slightly pearly.
There was a small space thanks to the creative solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the dishwasher.
The look of a small kitchen has restored a fully-opened wall over the work board.
The unique chicloscope with digitally printed theme is attractive, and is also well maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of the magnolia that resemble her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and a washbasin, and the new owner chose neutral shade of the lining.
Big shower corner has Ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment where the functions and devices will be in harmony.
We have united material and colored the interior and tried to make it elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
Another condition for the introduction was the barrierless solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and availability of the items of daily needs,” Kamiil Douděrová adds.
The Supreme Court has decided: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has decided that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for any criminal acts he may have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which refers to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MEPs, Ivan Fuks, Mark Šajdra, and Petr Tluchoře, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until their duties last November, said the spokesperson of the Supreme Court Petr Knötig.
This decision was rejected by the Court of First Instance of Iva Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the Members.
They claimed that they accepted a bribe in the form of ecclesiastical posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in the approval of laws.
On the contrary, the former Prime Minister, who offered them these posts, can also be prosecuted.
With Bárta, they also arrested an officer for anti-corruption police.
And in the case of alleged corruption by the Members of the VV, he also did not want to express much of the case, but he said: \"Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but in view of the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment on it.\"
According to the Law, the case is addressed by General Security Guards (GIBS).
Server tn.cz said Bart could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server of the first event.cz, the case may have been linked to the causation of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to Bart’s office was allegedly sought.
But the latest information, however, shows that the detention of Vita Bárta and Petr Lessy are not related.
The spokesperson of Eva Kropáčová's police bureau refused to comment on the fact that the case deals with the Prague city representativeship.
“We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts,” said the spokesperson of the City State Representation in Prague Štěpánka Zenklová on Friday.
That is the case by the applicant Bártov, and that is, indirectly, it shows that the file or criminal proceedings are carried out under the undercover regime.
Reporter Novinek managed to meet the wife of Vita Bárta Kateřina Classic in the morning before their residence in Prague Klárov.
She just put bags in her car and left.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bártov's detention expressed the leader movement of the Dawn Tomio Okamura.
According to his words, he doesn't even know what's going on in the case.
“Vitu Bart was one of many candidates for many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura,” he added.
In the past early elections to Sněmovna in Pilsen, Bárta has failed to run for the movement of direct democracy Tomia Okamura is known by his corruption bail-out of public affairs.
In April 2012, he was unrighteously sentenced to 18 months with a delay for 30 months.
The judgment was changed, and Bárta was released.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have lust, lust, and enthusiasm
For Prospala she was always in the first place family, so she wants to be subject to her treatment in her 38 years.
Either he gets a job in the overseas, and he's gonna extend his career, or he's definitely gonna end up with hockey.
I want to follow my dad and my husband's role.
“I look forward to it,” says a hockey player who is still in vain waiting for the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a declared worker, who's never going to fool anything.
Despite leaving his heart every time on the ice and being able to push a fellow.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbia in the past season.
But the desire to show everyone is still within me,” he says.
Perhaps it is expected that New York Rangers, who did not get into the season and have two injured ops - Rick Nash's attackers and Ryan Callahan.
What's your arrival in Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post journal that they should sign me, but that's all.
There was no evidence that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's not.
Didn't you even hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where this contract is really coming from.
When a mature player or someone can't do it, manchaft doesn't go down.
There are a lot of different factors that need to meet together to get the contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, right?
The wounded is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't go into the season, so there's a chance they're there, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
The other thing is you always need two sides for it.
I'd take a lot of offers tonight, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality that I have to live in.
Friday, you're leaving for America, are you expecting something to work?
I've had the expectations since July 5, when the free player market opened in NHL, and nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampy for the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and see you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
He's the one given that I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to follow my dad and my husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
Yours has two hockey matches on Sunday, and that's my whole holiday family, if we can go back to our kids in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time vehicles?
Yeah, man can think of a lot of things.
That might even happen.
I tried three years ago when I missed 50 matches for my knee surgery.
And I was having too much fun.
One day it gets to such a stage that all goals, victory, and credit will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
Have your job as much as you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have met me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it because you want to play NHL just because it's NHL or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, first place -- except for family, it's also a sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so sorry, our children - my wife - grew up in the States, started to go to school and so on.
And we would be so happy to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to say is that there's options in America somewhere else.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So you're planning to stay in America permanently?
We're gonna practice it like we're doing it right now.
This means that we will be in Bohemia in Hluboká and around České Budějovice in summer.
And in winter again in Tampa or where they lead us to our steps.
It's perfectly perfect to be warm all the time.
I was very lucky in my life.
I can tell you that I went across the street, it cost him a lot of strength and a cut-off, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where to live with a woman.
There's a lot of people in the world who'll be begging after this to choose what to do and how they'll live.
How long will you have in yourself at your age to work hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have to the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay.
That's not a plan.
So you can say this season is gonna wait for it to go away and then decide what else?
I'm at the stage when I've been coming from day to day.
Recently, the Director-General of ČEZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín decommissions at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new state energy concept and agreeing to the Contracts of diffration by the government.
These reasons are the current leadership of ČEZ trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, for the major shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give shareholders a recommendation, not hide behind him.
Only the sobotka government.
Andrej Babish starts to point out that his movement ANO will not have time to learn to a political craft in the opposition and that he will have to be straight to the government to create any.
The President of the ANO admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will come out tomorrow.

Police evacuated for shooting part of the airport in Los Angeles
At Los Angeles International Airport in the morning it was fired.
The police were evacuating part of the airport because of it. It was supposed to be a terminal of three.
The Reuters Agency with a appeal to California's media claims that the law men shot the gun of a armed man.
Los Angeles Times, with reference to the police, said that there was a firefight in which two or three members of the Security Administration were injured.
How many people were hurt and if there were any victims, but it's still not obvious.
Firefighters are talking about an event with a lot more wounded.
CNN: Israel bombarded the military base in Syria.
The goal was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
On Thursday, Israel military planes allegedly bombed the military base near the Syrian port of Latakía.
With appealing to the smallest American government, it was announced by CNN.
Israel’s press on the explosion in the alleged rocket warehouse was widely informed, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The Israeli military spokesperson refused to comment on the raid.
“We are not speaking to foreign media reports,” she said.
According to the U.S. governmental source of rockets and related equipment, which, in Israel's view, could be transported to a militant Lebanese Hizbollah movement.
The AP Agency, with appealing to another American security agent, informed that the target of the Israeli air raid was the Russian rocket SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television informed that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian anti-air defense system.
But according to DPA, the satellite image of the attack area has shown the Russian rocket type S-125 Nova.
In addition, they said that the batteries of the SA-3 rocket were seen, including the Command Centre with the radar to monitor the rockets and their targets.
According to the Israeli news, the rockets recorded are 35 kilometres long and they could carry a weight of 70 kilograms.
Israel has been bombing at least twice this year's shipments of rockets inside Syria, said CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will hit any supply of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other groups designated terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated the estimate of annual profit and expects record profits from recreationals in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic profit before tax to be between 325 and 340 million USD compared to USD 305 to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent twelve to 17 percent increase compared to the record profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created eight percent of its profits in the first half of the year, and the second half started with sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel outside the business trip.
“To date is our 10 profitable countries, and several focuss on record annual profit before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and Great Britain, which is traditionally our biggest profit creators.
During the second half of Australia, business with recreational activities has grown, which compensates slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain, Flight Centre managed well in the recreational area, while business clients were spending less.
The US trade has recovered after its loss during the seasonally weaker half-years and is expected to bring the third profit in a number of years.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher last night at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists held in Russia carried to Petrohrad
Ecological activists held since September in Russia because of protest against planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
The AFP has reported this today with a appeal to the international environmental organisation of Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original accusation of its piracy activists has not yet been withdrawn.
“Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic resources that thirty men and women, held in Russia for a non-violent action against the oil platform in the Arctic, were transported from the Correctional Facility in Murmansk to Petrohrad,” announced the organisation in the statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the busy activists are not clear; according to the DPA, it was a planned move.
Ecclesiastes first accused them of piracy, which in the event of condemnation has threatened them for up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this charge with a milder extremity for which a lower penalty would be at the upper limit of seven years of imprisonment.
Greenpeace, however, pointed out in today's statement that the piracy charges have not yet drawn up as promised.
I hear the arrests are now charged with two crimes.
Last week, a powerful investigation committee announced that piracy charges would replace the charges of extremity.
But when thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not withdrawn.
Instead, new charges were raised against everyone, quoted the AFP of the Greenpeace Declaration.
In mid September, the Russians held three dozens of Greenpeace movement members originating in 18 countries in the oil platform of Gazprom.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunris ship that sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they've all been held in custody against which they've filed appeals, but the court has rejected them all.
The environmentalists complain about the terms of the prisoner.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to AFP today, has indicated that moving to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
But there are no guarantees that the new prison conditions will be better than in Murmansk.
“In fact, they may be worse,” he pointed out.
She asked for help from Dutch King Willem-Alexandra, one of Faiza Oulahsen's busy assets.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the Monarch called for their situation to be discussed in a meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It states that Málikí has a great share in the recovery of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the battles in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature hours, at least one Shakespeare game will have to be studied, a 19th century novel, a romantic poetry and a contemporary British ballet since 1914.
The test will also include a “covered text” to encourage deeper reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language exam and will be encouraged to select English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new programme for English and Mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to pass through radical change.
For other essential objects change awaits next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual, which looks after the exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the exam, together with the new marking system and the smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is “a wide consensus in terms of whether we need to reform our testing system to regain our confidence in society” and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test is “a more demanding, ambitious and more stringent,
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
For comparisons of schools in Australia, mathematics is dedicated on average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, the coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive mathematics study, together with greater emphasis on this subject in the results ladders, will likely encourage schools to provide extra education.
The study plan will focus more on “problems from the real world, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-lost dispute between two wings fighting for influence inside the Ostrava ČSSD has been warmed up.
It all went up by the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turning to court because of the non-democratic formation of the candidate.
However, the causea activists did not want to express themselves too much, so that they did not harm the party even more before the elections.
But now the voters' voices are numbered.
As soon as Monday evening, Headmaster Ostrava called for him to step out of the side, and he'll probably push even to lose his job.
Peter Kajnar wants to fight.
What's going on in disputes, and who's on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Deník.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
I'm sure the ČSSD counted with a much better result.
Did it hurt us to deal with media disputes in front of the election?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, that corresponds to the state in which the USSD is now in.
She's a party with her internal problems, she's in sick, and people feel it's not all right in her.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are the internal diseases of the USSD?
I've been going through ODS for a while, and I'm afraid things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, powerful people who had previously expected to find their pre-bends at ODS, have moved to the people in the ČSSD and influence them.
It's then related to the fact that police and computers go after the Australian magistrate offices.
This shows that the USSD is not only composed of people who want the good of all others, but many of them think of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two unbelievable camps and in Prague, as it is seen in the current struggle for power between Haškovec and Sobotkovec.
But it's been getting ready for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a prediction of what was happening in Prague now.
The noise wing gradually served its positions so that, after the elections, it could create a situation that weakens the Sobotkovo wing.
Man is in politics in a situation where sometimes he has to compromise.
But everyone has an internal line where the compromises don't go anymore, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run to the House, but when I noticed the whole thing inside of the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralek that I would try to get to the country's candidate to strengthen Sobotkovo wing as Mayor of Ostrava.
The noise wing gave it a trace.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Haska?
I think Sobotka's fame is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to some extent also about visions for the side and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the central Executive Committee, can begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the position of the party.
According to what Michal Hašek has now demonstrated in Prague, he has completed his political career.
How did you know that the USSD's security management did not approve of you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on competitions, who will act like their members.
This competition should be based largely on program visions and on the abilities of these people to fill the visions.
But, of course, people who do not have the power or visions in this competition are also reporting themselves, but the political party is an elevator to money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people begin to get to the top because they break the rules without clumsy, they break the rules of the party.
They make their practices out of the political parties of the mafia, and I think they are breaking the laws of the Czech Republic.
Please note this problem is more important to me than to take care of whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect their statutes.
Is that why you made a proposal before the elections to court for preliminary action against the form of ČSSD candidates in the Moravian Region?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava strengthens its power by the fact that organisations that do not comply with it can cancel it, in order to set up new organisations, gradually throws out inconvenient members of the Party.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednárek from the club of representatives, but he filed an action against it, and they would rather cancel the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that it is the last option to agree with the parties through courts, but at the time the other methods and control authorities have stopped working within the ČSSD, it is the only option.
With Adam Rykalou, the Head of Pakistan's Head of Mission is to remove you from the position of the Mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of the Lubír Palyza has a matter of concern for this post.
It's true, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, gain voices, and strengthen their power on the side for those voices.
When I go back to the past, all that might have happened around Baník Ostrava's football club and the Buying of the stadium, they were just an excuse to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could mark me as a person who gave money where it wasn't.
At that time, the city bought property that has strategic value for it.
So how do you see it further with your continuing as mayor?
The county committee has already asked me and other people on Monday to consider their maintenance at the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when a thief screams, you grab thieves!
When we look at the results of my work in the past 11 years, I don't see anyone in the Australian social democracy that would initiate and promote, sometimes even against the members of the party, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technical park.
Still, I'm becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it any different than that I'm going to stop others from coming to the places they're looking for.
Are you going to fight these efforts any more?
Because if this Republic is to work well, it must also work well with political parties.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively control the state if it can't drive itself.
So I don't think I'd leave the USSD now, because I think whoever causes cancer on this side is not me, but those people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc will open in the historic centre of the public glider
The organizer of the Olympic Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Burný stated that the preparation work at the glider had started on 26 October and since Wednesday the aggregate is in operation for the production of ice.
The ice layer is already strong seven centimeters and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The archipelago has a surface of 375 square meters, podium took 358 square meters.
The Brussels and the surrounding ones will also have two booths with a puncher.
“We have expanded the floor area, increased the space before the stand, and almost the whole area of the floor is covered so that the skaters can easily move,” described the Burned.
Olomouc Street is already a reminder of the coming Christmas.
Last year was the glider due to the repair of Lower Square installed right before the main entrance of the town hall in Horní Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed for years, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could have acted directly before the Council in 2009, when the glider was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural programme, will be launched on the Upper Square month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of the senior in Zlínsk will again be dealt with by the regional court
The national court had met the five-year-old Slovak and twenty-two-year-old Czechs for lack of evidence.
The men denied the blame.
They are threatened by 15 to 20 years of prison or even exceptional punishment.
The spokesperson Peter Angyalosy confirmed that the main court had revoked the decision of the country and returned the matter to the hearing again.
The reasons that led the judge to this have refused to comment on the fact that the decision has not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, the youths attacked a seven-and-a-half-year-old man in his house.
The senior died of a tragic death.
According to the prosecution, men would have strangled him, beaten him, kicked and kicked all over his body as well as a metal object, probably a gas gun, put about three dozens of head woundes in his head.
A man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the cranial bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding into the brain that he thought at the scene.
Youngsters allegedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewels of around 14,000 crowns from the house.
In addition, according to the regional court, only indirect evidence against the defendant's dust marks, which the expert has assessed as not fully established in the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although in more than ten cases the scent marks from the crime scene were consistent with the defendants, the police initially referred to them as material and not smell marks.
Besides, she found out some doubt about handling them.
According to the Senate, the defendant's guilt was not demonstrated without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he was probably fallen down and hurt himself.
Nor has the patient called for rescue services mentioned violent death.
Criminists, after a few days, contacted giant doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police couldn't work with any evidence from the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
There was no defendant's DNA at the scene.
Young Slovák lived in Uherskohradzersk.
Now he's serving a penalty of 8.5 last year, which he has confirmed to him by the authority of the olamouc chief court.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who had a robbery of goldmaking.
Loupes became in October and November 2011 shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopny.
Younger accused of murdering the senior lives in the Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him in August after 11 months.
It starts with reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojm.
On Thursday, the stadium was chosen by builders who conducted the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the town stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet standards for the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter will close the cove of the Week of the Falls.
Saxophone Easter and Wayne Shorter's legend of jazz scene will make the next Wednesday work for the 18th year of the Struna Fall Festival.
Shorter will take off on November 6 in the Grand Hall of Lucerny, together with his quartet in Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, the sponsored jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia, led by Martin Kumžák, is added to Shorter.
In Shorter's modifications for symphonic orchestra, Pegasus from the newspaper album Without A Net, as well as his older composition Lotus and Prometheus Unbound will start.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also shows that the Prague concert in the autumn of Prague will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music over 60 years ago.
The reading of the interpreters he worked with is from Miles Davis over Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santan.
On his musical journey he met with Czech musician Miroslav Vituš and Vienna's native Joe Zawiłul, with whom in legendary Weather Report for more than one decade they gave direction to a new style merger.
He's been performing with Wayne Shorter Quarter for the past 13 years.
As such afterparty after the festival will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to the charismist singer Andrey Triany, the local audience will present the Manchester Go Penguin Trio with its jazz influenced by electron and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation of Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The ladies said that U.S.A.F.A.F.A. prohibits publishing sanctions for the referee.
Dagmar Damková, President of the Board of Judges of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing the punishments for the supremacy.
They show her UFA rules, which was mentioned in an interview for the Journal of the Law.
Otherwise, the FACR threat would be affected.
Damková also refused to party to footballers Plzně from where she came from in her function.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the committee are taken apart, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1:6,” said Damková in response to criticism, which broke up after Pilsen recently played twice as much penalty than other league teams.
In the past few months, though the FAČR has ceased to publish sanctions for the referee, Damková assures that they pay for their mistakes.
“Please tell me that if the Commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will restrict the delegation, whatever it was in any play,” said Damek.
The reason why the penalties are not published is according to the Women's ban on the European Football Union.
‘EUFA to publish such information prohibits and violates severe criminal offences’
We're very suspicious about us and we're looking for something for every mistake.
“We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, hard sanctions will come,” Damková said.
The other countries respect the ban.
“We were really the exception,” she added.
If the publication of information continued, the Commission said that the EUFA could lose money on the education and development of referees.
- And these are very important to us -
“Without them, we could not complete the programme on the education of referee,” Damek added.
Bárty's detention is related to Januszek and Behem: Is it behind the release of wires?
The President of the Public Vita Bart's case was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Together with him was also the Head of the Analyst and Informatics Department of Anti-corruption Police Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the hearings of lobbyists Roman Januška and former Mayor Paul Béma (ODS).
Information about the dispatch, with which the News.cz server came, confirmed the Czech Press Office's trusted source.
Janoška and Béma, who published in March last year a daily Young Front Today, and in which both men address each other as “Mazánek” - and“Kolibřík - show Janošk’s influence on the steps of the city under the Bąmová leadership.
The journal then stated that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS) had ordered them, two years later, to escape to ABL Security Agency.
That's when he owned Bart.
Server News.cz pointed out that the detained criminalist Petržík worked before he joined the anti-corruption police just for BIS.
The anti-corruption service, which was subsequently dealt with, went to Petržílek at the same time as they were published.
\"In view of the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all,\" said Mr. Michal Muavský of the Municipal State Representation in Prague.
He refused to confirm that the case was being supervised.
The case does not want to comment on or inspection for the same reason.
Six companies from ten are preparing for a new civil code.
Six companies from 10 are preparing intensively for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Trade Corporation Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the contested representatives of companies stated that both key codes were not at all addressed.
It is from the research of the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which has found the views of 108 Czech companies.
With regard to the upcoming term of effectiveness of the two key codes, a number of managers are now beginning to realize what a significant influence they can have on their business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years, in our view, will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long lived because of the lavrating of politicians insignificantly whether revolutionary changes will eventually occur or not.
“Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to move to new law for their companies without complications,” commented the results of the partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáł.
Of 61 percent of companies in intensive new legislation, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to prepare them in time.
In addition, 35 percent of the companies in this number are about to take the necessary measures at the nearest time.
Every fifth recognition company has not yet dealt with this, yet it has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and the issue cannot be assessed.
Only eight percent of the company admits that the recognition issues have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal topic related to the new civil law is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent) for the largest number of interested companies, followed by a solution to business conditions (16 percent) and changes in the cataster of real estate and liability for damage (after ten percent).
One of the most important newspapers of the entire recodification will be taken into account in the contracts only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel adjustment in both civil and commercial law will disappear, as a result of which contractual law should become more transparent for citizens and businessmen.
“In the case of entrepreneurs, the new amendment will offer many news with emphasis on the greater freedom to organise relations,” pointed out the lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luke Poded.
In the context of the Act on Business Corporations, almost a quarter of the company considers the issue of increasing the responsibility of the statutory authorities.
They follow the topic of changes in the call and the course of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means strengthening the obligations and possible impacts on the statutory authorities, particularly in situations where companies are at risk of falling or falling into it.
“In practice, this means that if the board members and the company’s enthusiasts do not deal with the care of a proper economy and do not turn the riskable down, they may lose the benefit of the performance of the function in the last two years,” he added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style develop like a living language
It is my job to preserve tradition and also lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, clarifying its position as Pierre Rainero, the director of style at Cartier.
This French luxury house was established in 1847.
It goes through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical attention to the villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team save almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in Western Africa; there are only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates at the CNN Hrdin 2013 award.
You can vote for him or any other of the ten main candidates in the 2013 CNN Hrdin Prize competition.
The winner will get $25,000 so he can continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwell has watched his father again and again fall into consciousness and drive to hospitals that have not been equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde injured in a car accident.
First, he was treated only with a broken hand, but then developed an infection that spread to his brain, and there he created a haematoma that caused his whole life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwell.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwell spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, where he got the treatment that was just available.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients out there.
Some people only die because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwell's father died, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 inhabitants.
For comparison only, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if doctors of Cameroon could visit, many could not afford it.
Two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwell.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwell saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his team of volunteers have performed a free 700 operations last year.
He became a blood surgeon himself at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members attend rural areas on the weekend where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, nearly 32 000 people have helped their volunteers.
Almost every Friday, it and up to 30 people rush into supply, secure on the roof of medical needs, and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They're not always associated with luck.
At one point, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get welcome as real heroes: feasts, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, medical care is free to celebrate and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unsatisfied energy, is very willing to join the local wedding.
The next day, the team is starting to treat hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each journey,” Bwell says.
They come to the village from within 60 kilometers, and that's a walk.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many treat malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get Berlins or gifted glasses or free birth certificate - a document that requires school, but which many depleted families simply cannot afford.
The team's doing a simple surgery under the local narcissity tonight.
Operations are usually done in the school building, at the city hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the place to another patient.
With the help of the lights from the generator, the operating room and Bwell's sanitary equipment and his volunteers work in early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
“To stay awake and continue working, playing drums all night,” says Bwell.
The team will head back to town on Sunday, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of camera doctors and foreign medical students, has performed 700 operations free of charge last year and realizes that their assistance can be very important to the local population.
One man said he could work again after surgery.
“This will change the future of our family, ” said the man.
In addition to organising these weekend clinics and surgical work at the Bwell hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second job is financed by about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when he sleeps,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He's always at the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For students of medicine and medical services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle in his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
“Doctor Bwell, we thoroughly washed our hands and removed the blood stains or held the instrument,” says O'Malley.
It's like a second year medical student in America you'll never experience.
Students usually pay their way to Cameroon alone and often arrive with their medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive at Yaounde, diet, transportation and study, he provides them with Bwell.
“No doubt he's a hero,” says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon to remain infinite.
For Bwell, a constant wrist isn't a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise given to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwell says.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain - that's why I do it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find out where you can help.
Minister Holcat renewed the function of the Chief Sisters for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number exceeds 100,000 in the Czech Republic.
I consider it essential that these functions should be clearly defined and formalised to have nurses' nurses under the structure of the Authority - representatives who may always turn to, if necessary, explained Martin Holcat, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of my sister and I think that the care department deserves proper attention from both the Ministry.
In the performance of this profession, not only high professionalism is needed, but also human approach and personal beliefs.
I will strive to enforce those steps that can improve the health nurse’s position.
“We have excellent and fine sisters in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their attitude to patients to carry out their callings in general empathies and help us to improve the image of the sister in the public’s eyes,” says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, on the occasion of her introduction to her office, also indicated that she wanted to address various aspects of the health care nurse's position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, education workers, other non-health professionals and doctors.
“I don’t necessarily want to separate the profession of doctors and sisters, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, and everyone has their competence and together with other healthcare professionals is a pooled work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.
“I encounter a number of problems that arise during the work of my sister, these difficulties I find and I intend to participate in their solutions.”
These include, for example, ensuring simplification of healthcare and medical documentation.
“I know from my own experience that some administrative acts of sisters are unnecessary and take away the time they could and should be given to patients,” says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to be targeted include improving working conditions, finding ways to better co-operation between the team and management of health service providers, adjusting competence and also working matters such as compliance with the labour law or non-commissioning of the nurse with insufficient number in the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous steaks, which, however, are not documented in any particular case where the rules could be broken.
“Where there is no prosecutor, there is neither a judge nor a judge, so the function of the Czech Head of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of the maintenance of anonymity of such complaints and a specific case to let the competent authorities examine,“ Alena Šmídová closes.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from Central Health School in 1978 and graduated from Charles University in Prague in a study programme of Education and Education (administrative in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been Head of the Department of Health and Other Non-Cerms and Recognition of Qualifications for the Education and Science of the GIBR since 2010.
During her professional career, she worked as a sister at an internal department bed, and she worked as a teacher at the Central Medical School where she was also 8 years of statutory assistant directorship.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the chief sister of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional textbooks for care and articles in professional journals, dedicated to lecture activities in the field of care.
She's not a member of any political party.
So I won't shut up with hate.
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to write for 12 years.
After long years of reading, he lived, but did not write, he published a new novel by VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) to the new wind, dark, present.
That it is not a warm union, it suggests the number of parties comparable to its most famous work of Housian (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't shut up hate.
Seeing yourself around all the time new and new clones of this human foolish malichery, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I am not talking about the elders, the faces ruined by powerless request, the vexlácká soul, and the opposite overfishing ideologies who are trying to sell their product with the expression of small shop whores.
At the beginning of the thousand years, I bought a little digital camera and filmed my Jurodic friends, weirdos and hidden creatures.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I prefer to go for a walk, and then I read books at night at the lights.
You're talking about the feeling of death, hate.
Was there a break that affected you somewhere in the past, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The break was a long time ago, about ten years ago.
That's when it didn't have a name.
Well, that's what I was living for.
There's still a quiet boy out there.
I can see another alone shrink, everyone in my anxiety tornado.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm going to take part in this giant, thousands of years of life-spanting system on this planet - the spread of an incompetual future.
This enormous, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when the way of the experiment-omyl arises another and other generations of beings, which in the trillions of interaction in a second creates some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start completely from scratch?
An excuse, or better said dialogue, which leads right and left half of the brain, sometimes spills on the surface and is formed in a book.
As the seasons of peace are covered by silent metastasiss of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I could feel the white lavina of life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, I'll be arrested one day.
It is a set of questions that formed the brain and treated them with layers that are stored in darkness - under the level of consciousness -
Neocortex, gray cortex, asks the older evolutionary departments, is going to ancient losokruhs of the brain tree.
He's talking to the furry beasts, asking snakes, looking for an answer in a bird flight, raising his eyes to clouds on the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often, you express yourself to the egu metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical notes all memories, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branched with trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly changing presence, in an unintimiding effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there'll be overload problems.
Analogly - as if you were - PC, from the speech emulator program and translators from foreign languages, you would first get involved in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after several failed restarts, it ended with a dark green-like Biosu screen, in a basic system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who haven't yet understood what we're talking about, I'm talking about a psychospirial crisis.
Are you referring to her often - why do you care about this kind of regression regularly?
Because it's the pit.
In the case of functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, there will be a breakthrough.
Here is a good thing to quote Nietzsche: “For so long he looked into the abyss when she looked into it.
The feeling - that man is lost if all hope disappears, psychologically - will die - and new quality comes in.
And why am I interested in this personally?
I'll answer the parable.
Once, one fell into the mouth and drowned, running days, months and years, he was still drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - so live.
He became a diver.
I hope someone can help me with some of the written sentences that helped Countal's texts to me once.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
The one who is not able to tell the meaningful one, one call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter from a friend:
“I’m someone else - this reader is involved directly in the process of formulation of words and sentences -
From the early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nema, running after Stínadas in the dark streets.
In the same way, after all the interpretations of the authors and their messages, it is: “The sun of the bright worlds of other Karl Hynek Máchy”
And if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back of the reflection that goes over the people who read the book to you, will he?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with their hard life decisions.
The books are actually “life - or better said“to the worlds. ”
They are encoded in letters, have experience, history of regions whose language.
Whenever we wake them up, we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden by the divine - to wake up other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is the fact that the DNA is placed in line - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, as it is - a chain of copyright readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like reading.
Do you get into it again with joy, or do you feel otherwise after years?
I'd rather talk about it today.
And what did I find out about it?
Good smart people live everywhere.
Their basic character - they're inconceivable, they don't draw much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiation, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope that there is still a good bookstore (namely June), a happy palate and a good girl bull.
At one drunk, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Housian.
I looked in their eyes, and then I was shown to be a crushed, read specimen of my book.
I left the diaphragm in my distractions and cried briefly with a man.
We all stood there, smothered, and drunks with milk, crying.
Then the young blond bowl didn't last, and he jumped out of the window with the eye in the snow.
It was underground.
We ran into the nightlands, and we were eating happy angery sensitive people, the painful soul of the landscapers and the steak of fallen patriots - they went out and moved like wolves till morning.
Every book of yours is formally, in fact, different from the previous ones.
Does it also apply to the text of the Wind, dark, present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale of one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novele Suchodol inserts the words of one old Russian poverty in the mouth of a human healer: At sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujana.
There's a dog lying there, a gray box on it.
Horrible, terrible, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from now on.
Maybe we've been devils a long time ago in hell, and we've won what role we're playing on this country.
Are you going to continue writing or are you going to let that happen again on the free tide of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Břečina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unidentifiable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our appetites from such depths and in such a width that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we are doing exactly in the intelligence of our programmed assignment.
We're rewarded by the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endomorphine and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to fight, die in defense and gain new personal territory.
Sometimes there's going to be a disorder and we'll have compassion.
Only then we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the coast of the ocean's unconscious, and in a wild sail made from a dirty hoody caught the tides of a wet wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama retreats from health care
After the wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your medical program, you can keep it“
With appealing to hundreds of thousands of announcements from Republicans in recent days, the President was accused of cheating the American public.
Last night, Obama dropped out of his original promise.
“The great majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called “in the media,” Obama called for Americans who received this notification to search for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You will get a better offer,” he said.
His administration claims that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population who bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on Available Care.
\"I say it to these Americans on a plane: you deserve better,\" said Sebelius in her statement before the Washington Energy and Trade Committee.
Sebelius, who supervised the implementation of the Law on Accessive Care, said that the launch of the Internet market was “bundling” since October.
“I’m disappointed and angry like everyone else,” she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
Sebelius’s irritable sentence, which was captured by the on-board microphone, spoke yesterday towards the adviser sitting behind it at last night’s meeting of the Committee, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who concerned whether or not she had to join Obama’s custody programme.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly asked why “architet”, the Law on Available Care voluntarily did not give the Government a sponsored insurance and did not purchase a program over HealthCare.gov, which is now inciting millions of Americans.
Which billionaires are you gonna call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed and according to various sources from the agency and behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The transaction notification should come back in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, which is before November 11.
Keller's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG.
The one with the Saza Telecommunications brand entered the LTE frequency auction.
And that's a general surprise, until then, the company's taste to enter telecommunications did not speak of.
But Sazku is now leading a very experienced telecommunications pet Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing manager of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), after which he became director of Slovak T-Mobil and was the last head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The sazka plays just a few cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafon's.
And it gives logic.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would not, under normal circumstances, like Vodafon, but according to the information provided by Hospodářské noviny, this could be part of much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from an agreement between competitors O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If this succeeds in the LTE system (as a rookie can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone will not even be allowed to be released in the auction, respectfully he will not hesitate to scratch only a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
The Vodafone can share the Sazkou network.
Vodafone launches the Rate into its 2G/3G network (respectivative LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
The set-up will start to build a expensive LTE network, which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend his money on a fixed internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech Republic) immediately obtain a full operator with still decent profits and wide offer of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big pier that's going to wait for restructuring.
In the auction, LTE would have won Kellner for O2 and very probably in synergies with T-Mobil.
Both companies have already declared that networks will share.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget enjoys.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafon, T-Mobil, Kellner or Komárka.
Or two aunts of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever go around without signing events?
President Zeman's era has entered a legendary scene with an ashtray, and so it's not hard to listen to complaints that he collect evidence of the burden of the castle type.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Harder has not been documented in such a way, let alone to sign under it.
True, the leaders have become editors.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where some journalists would take such a inclination to the human beings - whether it is a response to a direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of non-local empathic obscenity.
And if we already assume a general outbreak, we cannot forgive the question of whether they are trying to change the ratios on TV, or at the same time the unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given an opportunity.
The truth is, those who say that, in developed countries, there are no attempts to intervene politicians.
But the truth is that this does not mean that there are complaints about public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be the tendency they own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this is not our situation.
But it may also be in a country that thinks that it is the most corrupt in the world, the black and white stories of evil politicians and good journalists spend more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of an unobtrusive situation in which many imperfect human beings are beings.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: Presidents on the edge of forces
It is almost rule that there was no head of the state in the key moments of the country in such a form that it could fulfil its state's obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would experience the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would have been a bit different.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic resistance, air force could fly outside the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right now, and there would not be working about their legitimacy.
And most of all, this surrender doesn't have a nation of hangover to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman, and he was still in the context of Munich, but during the war it started to go downhill with him, and in February 48 he acted according to that.
To be a little better at it, he could've left the third time in exile and broke the legitimacy of the communists and their punks.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
He was elected not to be in a position to decide.
But he had to, even though there wasn't a big decision to make with a knife on Hitler's neck in the office.
In March 1939, Francis Moravec spoke about what should be done to the occupation that he knew about on the day exactly did not go so smoothly and with such gain.
The senile president and cowardly government did nothing, but they did not believe him, but they were afraid.
Human concern Gottwald had his flight mates executed as Moscow commanded him.
Ludvík Svoboda has definitely made it impossible to participate in normalization and had to sit down, completely senile.
That Husák was powerless and sick of depressing old man events in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only way.
Havel was lucky that he hasn't been met in the office in the last few years, he's been saved by the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his factors show that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here's what we've got.
The head of the state and chief commander of armed forces looks like he looks, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, the outside threat of the Republic is not now at risk.
Or maybe it's a threat, just not to see it.
Then it is a question that it is not (from a historical point) well that the President is not entirely at strength.
But it's not normal.
Couldn't we choose the President in this country again once again an acceptable thinkable and acceptable healthy person?
The distant planets, black and white films or a little fantasizing about alien life on earth are not topics that would be the American jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter pitched the ice.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6th in the Grand Hall of Prague Lucerna will close this year's Festival of Falls, namely everything related to everything.
Wayne Shorter's chapter of jazz saxophones are the current feelings of musicians.
According to his award, two generations of younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not of harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
This principle, however, is the newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer who wears nine Grammys, some of Miles Davis' co-founders, and today probably the largest living jazz saxophoneist - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life with music is closely related.
In my 1980 ’ s, I felt that it was best to let life surprise me.
“A lot of people plan everything, and then they are disappointed when things are developed differently,” says Shorter.
How the insects from Thailand raised the margins of the Paris bar
Maybe you're fooling around the insect, and you don't know that you're eating it for about half a kilo a year.
For example, it's grounded in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutritious and you have a unique experience also taken care of.
He first ranked the insect offer in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, the cook and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
Bar, for whose name was the inspirational book William Burroughs Our lunch, you would find in fashion 18th district near Montmartru a generous visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, sealed with red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, new guests can enjoy not only different larries, cobs or water bugs, and also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packed vans (if the insect didn't damage the wings, did not hurt the legs or damaged the eyes) of Daviron are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneer menu shows just a few reasons why to consume insects.
The first is an environmental benefit because the production of insects is much less costly for our planet (which concerns finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
“Welcome is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids,” said Daviron for Reuters station.
At the same time, the young cook does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
“I don’t protect the world, I’m just in the middle of a new experience,” he explained.
Far from everyone, it would probably be an idea of how he consumes a bug decorated with a dog, but the reaction of a pařížský bar customer to served insects is very positive according to the owner.
Even the whispers finally taste, even when they begin with the smallest bites and eventually pick out the scorpion.
These quality plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Enterprises in Construction in Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and not interest in the State to address investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in different regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will provide substantial amounts for heating, but also a chance for construction companies and building material producers.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs.
From the fiscal point of view, there are significant leverage and multi-plicational effects, it is also one of the most significant growth measures.
Therefore, the association of entrepreneurs in construction in the Czech Republic strongly disagrees with the government resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps to allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be identified within its framework.
REPORT, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president dug up and finished the crutches.
President Miloš Zeman left a butterfly hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed and went to the castle in Lánech.
What condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage “was too far away. ”
John Kerry indicated that the U.S. defensive attitude about his follow-up programs and said, in some cases, the espionage “was too far away. ”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for the fact that, in view of the annoying discovery of NSA spying activity, which appeared thanks to the informant Edward Snowden, they acted as “autopilot”
Public information has created a diplomatic storm between the American government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as the others in the government, have actually learned some of the things that have been done out of setriality because there was this possibility, with reference to the Second World War, a difficult period of Cold War, and then of course September 11, ”
So he became the first highly built member of the American government who admitted that the American espionage crossed the line, but stressed that no law had been infringed.
He said: “In some cases this has gone too far.
And the president is determined to try and explain it to people and he is already conducting thorough reviews so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people's rights in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA is seeking good and that its monitoring operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves off. ”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is firmly determined to kill and throw people into the air and attack governments.
And why don't you be able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented the plane from falling down, the buildings did not explode, and the people were not executed, because we already know about these plans forward.
The President of the Senate Subcommittee on Thursday said that American legislators are going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad regarding alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that it is necessary to continue to link their forces to the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he was talking to members of the European Parliament and other people and that he was worried about their threats that he would stop taking part in anti-terrorism organizations because they were being decomposed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the nation's security interests, it is really important that Europe stay on one ship with us, taking into account joint efforts to combat terrorism, said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the President of the Senate's sub-committee of foreign relations for European affairs.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear that we have to continue to work together with terrorism regardless of their anger over NSA programmes.
News in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, disrupted relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said that they were inseparable and dismayed by the metadata that NATO allies gathered and shared with the United States this week,
Another revelation quoted the documents highlighted by Snowden that the NSA followed the German Chancellor Angela Merckel's cell phone and other than 34 world leaders.
The head of National Intelligence James Chopper was defending allies as necessary and said it was from both sides of the ordinary matter.
In the middle of Murphy's screams, he said his office plans a parliamentary journey that should take place this year and hopes that both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who agree to engage are to be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the journey is to help correct relations, he added that “the well-meaned educational measures will also be prepared,” he said.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people in terms of spying programs they use for years alone.
“Though we are managing our surveillance programmes to better protect European rights, they also need to realise that we are not the only ones who are doing spying here,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry is heading up this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the involuntaryness that has already developed an American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as to the US tracking activity.
An Australian appealed against her stay in Thai prison
A 21 - year - old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by the Land Court on the island of Phuket of perjury charges when the Thai police said that the taxi driver along with two other men who held her was attacked on Sunday 10 June.
However, a record from industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police conducted interviews with Bamford two days before she realized she had made up her story.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a detention facility with low security in Phuket, instead of being placed in jail for adult women.
He's the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who requested help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera in the case of his daughter.
Tunks said to Sidney's letter Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns,” about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
“Evidently this is a difficult period, but we hope he will return to us as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 mud.
Australia reports show that, in the meantime, she spent a vacation in the recreational area of Krabi in South Thailand.
The legal resources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she received a warning that a appeal could lead to a lawsuit that would raise her sentence and lead to an adult prison location.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith's travel agency in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct a corrupt picture for tourists, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.
I'm joking.
He got a puck in his defense belt and no one's caught it anymore.
In addition, the leak turned after a quick forhend cage.
Jaromír Jigger scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, on Thursday night then 119. winning goal in NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
\"After looking at this video, my agent Petr Svoboda called the director of Czech drugs and asked him if I was interested in making a commercial on their most advanced train Pendolino,\" he wrote at the introduction with the Tygr.
He says we're very similar.
I guess I'll have to quit my night training so I won't go any faster.
“I fear that then the Minister might call himself a defense minister, and he would like to make a commercial on the jet - he added his smiles.
In addition, New Jersey signed a second victory in a row.
- And most importantly, you noticed Mary Rottr’s treatment is taking place, - he concluded Jigger.
Instead of the electoral candle call guláš
The October elections rather than the winners brought a lot of losers.
They are not only parties that have not even reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and eventually also the ČSSD because of their internal circle.
The politicians served us a gulas instead of holiday candles this weekend.
The election has become the movement of Andrei Babiš, which voters have promised to change the previous political style of rule.
The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and the expansion of the winning party is recorded by the political (from) will of President Miloš Zeman regardless of the wishes of voters who publicly supported the party President Zeman, nor elected to the Chamber of Members.
Although the President lost a strategic lead against other politicians because of the unpleasant events, he still has a few ways to get it back - for example by choosing a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD's chances of getting the Prime Minister's chair in my eyes are giving up, the entrepreneurs of Andrei Babiš come closer.
This development for business in the Czech Republic is also a better report than the pre-election scenario of the Czech Left Government.
In view of the loud resistance of ANO to get together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (total 111 Members).
In view of the spread in the USSD, which has become an impenetrable and weak parter in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite depressing for the ČSSD.
The Minorial Government of the ČSSD, composed of non-Seminovators, will probably not pass to the Castle.
In addition, any government to which the ČSSD is involved will be threatened by unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats that can lead sooner or later to another generation on the side.
So I ask myself: ‘We are not working alone for the next premature elections.
Another election would be a referendum on the power of the electoral mandate of the ANO movement.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income tax or state-owned bank building, have hopefully fallen under the table.
On the contrary, ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree, for example, to promote business, a sober fiscal policy (governmental deficit under 3% of GDP), to promote employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce lower VAT rates for selected goods.
Three areas are most present in the view of social policy and state size.
ANO's on top now, so the program is currently the most likely coalition of ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be getting to the right.
Which, from my point of view, is the better result than the left-hand tax program for everything that's still moving in the economy.
