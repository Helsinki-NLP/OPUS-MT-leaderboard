The members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “have looked like Mupeti. ”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are confronted with the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reasons for the proposal are the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Velšský parliament.
The members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could create a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group is concerned that “this is mixed with Twp and Pwp”
For readers outside Wales: In the Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means \"hoe.\"
The member for the side of Plaid said that the group as a whole “not happy,” and suggested alternatives.
The Velšský Conservative stated that his group was going to change the name “in open mind”, but noted that MWP had close access to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Italian letter ‘v’ is expressed as the letter ‘u’ in the English language of York.
The Commission, which is now preparing legislation for the introduction of changes to the title, stated: “The final decision on how members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on members of themselves.
In 2017, the Law of the Welsh Government gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public advice on the proposals, where the broad support gained a variant called the Assembly of the Velšský Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or the WMP, but the MWP variant gained the greatest support in the public discussion.
The members of the assembly obviously propose alternative options, but the fight for consensus can bring concerns to the President of Elin Jones, who will submit a proposal for legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the proposal for a committee system.
The members of the assembly will vote on their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
The Macedonians are going to vote for a change in the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether the name of their country will change to “The North Macedonia revolution”
All human voting should solve dozens of years of conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to the Greek territory and repeatedly protests against an application for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President of Gjorge Ivanov, who is a supporter of the plebistite about the change of title, said that the vote would not follow.
The members of the referendum, including the Prime Minister of Zorana Zaeva, argue, however, that the change in name is simply a price for entry into the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will shut down because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I spoke to say that he was on every corner of the bar and church,” says Mr. Adams.
\"There is neither there nor one today--
The disappearance of bars is understandable, according to him.
“ People meet in a different way today, ” he says.
“Bares are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people regularly go, ”
As far as the churches are concerned, they are concerned that money from the sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they began.”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats full of such a type of people who will not help the remaining saints in the quarter.
“ The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these homes will be white,” he says, “and therefore soon comes the day when these churches close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments would become members of the churches.
Both churches built a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original Belarusian Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, which was nearby.
St. Martin took over a black-and-white congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who stood at the head of the boycott of retailers on the 125th Street, the main shopping pool in Harlem, who refused to employ or increase black people.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building strongly, but when the fathers of Father Johnson planned to build it again, they ordered a bellcrap.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin, called the bellogue proudly “the names of the poor.
The expert who played at the bellhouse in July called it a different: “cultural treasure - and“ an unfamiliar historical instrument -
This expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first belloon in the world where the black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bellhouse in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martina had a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom called the Latin representatives of the church, others then episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of the elders, the Governing Body of the Pharisees, sent a letter in which he expressed the concern that the diocese would “be trying to carry out the cost of the elders, although it did not take part in the acquisition of architects and builders that the diocese had sent.
Some of the Pharisees complained about lack of transparency by the diocese.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old boy in California who was racing for the lobsters.
According to the official reports, the shark attacked Saturday and hurt a 13-year-old boy who went to California for lobster on the day of the start of the lobster season.
There was an attack this morning shortly before 7 o'clock near the Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he and his friends had been on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard a boy calling for help, and then he fell to him with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that the call first considered the joy of the catch of the lobster, but then “he realized that he was screaming“ He was making me!
He bit me!’
When Hammel got to the boys, he noticed that “he had the entire area of the key bones. ”
“I asked everyone to go out of the water: “There is a shark in the water! ” Hammel adds.
The boy was delivered by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Hospital in San Diego in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
C.T. Larry Giles at the press conference said that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was intended that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Authorities for investigation and security have closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 types of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the cosmetic market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to build up Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specialised sales will be available.
As part of a strong market launch with cosmetics in Great Britain, which is worth 2,8 billion pounds and is increasing, while sales of fashion and domestic needs fall, will be tested in 11 stores across the country. If successful, then the next year will expand to other sales.
Investment in cosmetics is connected with the effort of supermarkets to find use for regals that have previously been used for television, microwave ovens and home use.
Sainsbury's states that it doubles the size of the offer of cosmetic products to up to 3 000 products and first mentions brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also receive an existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees branded places similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also reiterates its range of Boutique make-up, so most products will be vegan, which young customers increasingly demand.
In addition, it will be tested in two stores of Saintsbury’s retailer of Fragrance Shop. The first such shop was opened in Croydon on the south of London last week and will be created this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards daily shopping of a small amount of food in local shops means that supermarkets must make it more difficult for people to attract.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like business houses, because the chain of supermarkets is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount dealers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of Argos branch stores and also introduced a series of Habitat department, which is a chain that he bought two years ago.
The previous supermarket attempt to remake a department with cosmetics and a pharmaceutical range ended in an infamous way.
At the beginning of the Millennium Sainsbury’s test was a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after the argument about the distribution of drug sales revenue in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago, he sold his 281 drugstores for £ 125 million to Celesio, which own chain of pharmacies Lloyds.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Sales director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the beauty alley to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who customers will be able to consult with.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and attractive environments and the favourable location means that now we present an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old shopping modes.
Peter Jones is “extended after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for £11 million
The Dragons Den Peter Jones star “scold after the television moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract value of $111 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the sign of Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Seventeen-year-old moderator of the show announced leaving on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was angry with Dragons Den Peter Jones by leaving their lifessyl business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the information provided by Jones, “when a TV star during a tight Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that, due to a new contract, it will no longer be possible to spend enough time with their brand of clothing and Truly's accessories.
The business was compared to the brand Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of the Willoughby moderator in the estimated value of £11 million.
When the 7th Willoughby on Instagram announced that Truly's brand was leaving, Jones went from Britain to one of its summer headquarters.
“ Truly’s wife was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future to ensure her for several decades ahead.
Its decision to leave all the stakeholders completely shocked.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The Marlow headquarters is full of items ready for sale -
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator show This Morning, which belongs to the most profitable British stars, could cost millions of money to the company due to the fat investment in the products from pillows and candles to clothing and homemade clothing and the possible further delay in markings.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughbys and his husband Dan Baldwin are ten years close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and the 20-year-old Jones joined in March as chairman of the board.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is supposed to become an M&S ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin with the moderation of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source close to Jones last night said: “We will not comment on his business matters.
The difficult negotiations “and then we fell in love. ”
He used to joke about the criticism that he would get from journalists as a remark that some consider to be “an unworthy president,” and for the positive talk of North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump answered his mocking “voiceman - voice.
“I have not given up anything -
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore, Trump appreciated as a big step towards the denuclarisation of North Korea, Kim was interested in another meeting.
But the negotiations on the destruction of nuclear weapons have taken place at a dead end.
More than three months after the June sum in Singapore, the major North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho on Saturday told the world leaders at the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea did not see “responsible response” at its first steps to armament.
Instead, the US continues in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at the edge of the war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship--
His attempt to improve relations with Kim, according to him, has brought positive results - termination of rocket tests, assistance in the liberation of hostages and the return of the remnants of American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of the outside, we should have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said and showed up to the crowd before us.
Invented tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have decompensated the island and killed hundreds of people
In a situation after the Lambok earthquake, foreign NGOs have learned, for example, that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok have been evicted from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a vital prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
“In many cases they have, unfortunately, made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little difficult,” says Mrs. Summung.
The Save the Children organization, although it brings together a team that leaves for the Palu, is not yet clear if foreign staff can work here.
Mr Sutupo's national disaster spokesperson said that Indonesian actors assess the situation in Paul to find out whether it would be possible for international organisations to help.
Since earthquake occurs very often in Indonesia, the earth is still unprepared to the wrath of Mother Nature.
In Acehu, however, shelters against the tsunami were built, but it is not common at all on other parts of the coast.
The loss of human lives probably contributed even to the apparent lack of siren warning in Paul before the tsunami, even if the warning was given.
Even in the best time, travel among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that anchored in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of the new calamity.
The improvement of bad Indonesian infrastructure was the lead of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year he will seek to re-election, but his government is suing losses in financing.
President Joko also faces pressure from the continuing sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
The street struggle between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already demanded more than a thousand people's lives and tens of thousands of people have been banished from their homes.

She was flying high and headed to the top right corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped Kep Arrizabalag and ended up on the net.
“I tried to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as fast as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible” said Sturridge server LiverpoolFC.com.
“ I saw Kant approaching me, so I didn’t think much about it and shot at one touch. ”
Chelsea in half-time led 1-0 after the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hasard in 25 minutes.
Attacker Blues sent a passport back to Mateo Kovac, then turned in the middle of the field and sprinted half of Liverpool.
Kovacice played the ball fast.
Then he sent the ball with a beautiful alley to Hazard's lime.
He ran away from defense and left to a distant pole next to Alison Becker from Liverpool.
In the middle of the 15th hour, the Livrepool in the League of Masters at the San Paolo stadium in Italy, Naples, is stuck with the local team.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London with Videoton in the EUFA European League.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament has recently become a hit because of an argument about “recasting history”
His exile would be a due punishment for the fact that his fantastic puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroyed a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “a foolishness, ” and“ an effort to translate history.
President Cromwell of Society John Goldsmith says: “In the current debate on removal of sculptures, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character would become one of the goals before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell hasn't even ordered an iconoclasm in English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century -
The wonderful formation of Cromwell, the author of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century and part of the historicality of the characters that many think is still worthy of being celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “The many people consider Cromwell, although today a little less than at the end of the 19th century, to be the defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course, in his case by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unexplained historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century resulted in the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identified figure which represents one side of this divide.
His achievements in the function of Lord Protector also stands for the celebration and reminiscence,
The killer pig broke the Chinese farmer.
According to information from the local media, there was an attack on the South East China market and a fiduciary death.
As the journal South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the last name “Yuan” was found dead with excess artery in the pool of blood near a guy on the market in Liou-pchan-suej in Kuej-čou Province.
The breeding body of pigs is prepared to inject the vaccine to pigs in the country on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, China, China.
He arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from Jün-nan's secondary province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that door was open.
According to him, he was a big pig with a blood pressure on him.
According to the information, it was confirmed in the forensic examination that the 250kilogram pig was torn apart by the farmer.
“Bratranec had his feet all bloody and torn, ” quoted Guiyang Evening News cousin, who referred to as the last name “Wu”
On the security camera tape, it's like Yuan came to the market on Thursday 440 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animals that killed were neither Yuan nor his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was locked up so that no one else would think of it when the police at the crime scene collected evidence.
Market leaders are allegedly dealing with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband on the farm in Massachusetts and the men critically injured.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pig pushed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove him to the farmer's wife.
After in 2012, the Oregon farmer ate his pigs, one farmer from Manitby said to the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as “the trigger ”
“They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will bring strong rain to the Southwest of the USA
Hurikán Rosa, according to predictions, is weakening and moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next days, but to the northern Mexico and the Southwest, the US will bring flood rain.
At 5 o'clock in the morning of East Time, Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, which represents a hurricane category 1, and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, when Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, it will be like a tropical storm and it will start pushing the tropical humidity north into the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
The Tropical humidity, then with the approaching low pressure storm in the following days, produces on the southwestern U.S. heavy rains.
The decreases of 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous floods, currents of droughts and possible land clusters in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity causes precipitation to be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the Southwest of the USA, especially above most Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In the rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain, floods may occur.
In view of the danger of tropical precipitation, it would be very vague to walk into the desert.
Strong rain can cause the canons to become running rivers, and storms will bring local impact winds and floating dust.
The approaching low pressure bra will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation over 13 mm can occur, which could cause smaller currents of nets and gliders.
It will be the first rainfall in the rain season in this region.
Sunday night and Monday morning, the rain will spread to Arizona.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to Four horns and it will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperature throughout the United States, because the Arctic will start to cool down, but it will still be warm in the tropical zone.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the USA on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is a difference of almost 11 degrees Celsia.
In the next few today they will try to expand theky summer heat.
In most territories in the center and east of the USA, warm start of October with temperatures around 27 °C from the south is expected to be part of the Northeast of the USA.
In New York City, there could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the USA in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels of a quarter-on-one-one-one-one-one-year-old judge named Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of the sexual attack that allegedly occurred in the '80s.
In the meantime, the political political situation continued and the publishers interrupted the current programmes with reports on the sudden fifth turnover: the agreement that the Senator had brokered for Arizona Jeff Flake, about the fact that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was sure that Kavanaugh was in charge of the high school party in the drunk shop and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that the event has been followed by more than 20,4 million people who are reporting Nielsen.
The company calculated average monitoring at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
Numbers for other stations that broadcast statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network have not been immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at offices.
For comparison, it is similar to the number of viewers watching football matches in playoffs or the sharing of Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest observation from all stations when, according to Nielsen, he was followed during a full-day hearing on average by 5.69 million viewers.
The second was an ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million spectators.
The interest persisted even after the end of the negotiations.
Senator Flake was the main character of the Friday drama.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN cameras and CBS on Friday morning, they caught the protesters screaming at him when he was going to take the elevator to the trial committee.
CNN used to live over how he stood up to his eyes and got himself loaded.
One woman said: “I am standing right in front of you. ”
“You think the country is telling the truth, ” he said.
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are powerless.
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the committee was to vote on the presentation of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote on the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if he'd filed charges against the candidate by the next week to investigate the FBI, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partly convinced interviews with his boyfriend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without the investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of ‘politics’ about Brexity.
Ministerial President Theresa May, in an interview for Sunday Times, accused the critics of her plan to leave the European Union, that “politicalists, about the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conference of Conservative Parties in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to that with the Prime Minister on the front side, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose each other’s duties is “a totally absurd one”

Last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the match.

“This is what you are still afraid of,” Wade said.
The volcano blazing ash on Mexico City
The ash that comes from the Popacatepetl volcano hit the southern district of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for disaster prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the Vulcan activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre has been watching a number of storming and shocks.
There were images of frontal glass cars covered with thin ash in some quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, on social networks.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of volcanoes, located 72 km (45 miles) south east of the capital city. The last earthquake was shaken by central Mexico in September 2017 and was 7.1 degrees strong.
The Vulcan, known as “Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police met with the Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting for independence, and thousands of people were involved in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence divided by Catalania.
The great cops blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them. The one on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, the police had to use shoes to calm down.
During several hours, the independent groups sang “We will not forget, we will not forgive, in the face of protesters of the Union who called “Let Spain live, ”
According to the local press, 14 people were easily injured in protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrates it, there remains a tension in the region seeking independence still high.
The voters spoke out of most of them for independence, but participation in elections was low, because opponents fought them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in violent clashes across the region tried to end their vote in electoral rooms.
Groups supporting independence remained out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations from supporting national police.
The demonstration was done, but she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-six-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes to gain independence for Catalan.
“ We have been through one of the best moments in the summer.
My parents were happy to vote, but now we're in a dead end,\" he said.
Despite the important, even though a tight victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan Parties supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves, or they are waiting for their share in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Two-four-year-old designer Joan Puig recorded protests to support the police on his phone, saying that the conflict was defrosted by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more intense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the collapse of democratic values and repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish government,” he said.

Mengov's cod secured Livingstone victory of 1-0 over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston guaranteed a victory
Livingston, who came from a lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard a second defeat from 18 matches in the role of the Ibrox club manager.
Trefa Dolly Mengy showed up critical when Gary Holt's team got to Hibernian second.
Gerard's team of this season hasn't had the Premiership win on the host field yet, and next Sunday, the first Hearts will be standing on which he loses eight points.
Even earlier, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston expanded a number of games without defeating the division for six games, so the head coach Holt, who fired Kenny Miler last month, hasn't tried defeat.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the indiscriminate guests
Holt's team had been leading a long time before the goal, because his directness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he failed to succeed before the gate, then Alan Lithgow, in a slide, just missed Craig Halketta's head before the goal.
Home enough to watch Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could take standard situations.
And so there came a key goal.
Anti Rangers was posted free kick and Livingston made himself a crack, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent out Mengu, who used the ball in the middle of the fine territory to work and score.
At this stage the Rangers dominated the ball, but the domestic defense was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not usually been busy.
The same picture of the game was also in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped his legs from the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow didn't hit the next standard Livingston situation.
In Livingston's fine territory, the centers which players have continuously cleaned, and the interior has also two penalts, after Halkett's attack on the replacement of Glenn Middleton and another hand.
‘Fenomén - from Livingstone - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of games and manhood have almost changed since returning to the top, but the great praise deserves Holt for how the team demolished since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, led by a well-organized defense while Menga kept up the whole time at Connor Goldson's emergency and Joe Worral.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerard, but they don't get these standards anymore.
Their end line was simple - only once they penetrated the home side - and for Rangers it should be a wakeup, because they are located in the middle of a table.
Erdogan had a mixed admission in Cologne
When Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all smiled.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, which aims to correct relations between allies in NATO.
They did not agree on a number of topics including human rights, freedom of the press and the adoption of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey is in this city.
Police for security reasons have prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from meeting before the Mosque, but there have been many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were heard, many of them were Kurds, protesting against Erdogan, who judged his politics and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the controversial visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as autocrat.

Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can benefit)
It is not usual for Arizona to hit the tropical low pressure gate, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
National meteorological services have already issued a warning against floods for Mondays and Tuesdays from Western Arizona for Southern and Eastern Nevada, South East California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to leave on Tuesday by direct route through Phoenix and rain on Monday night.
National meteorological services in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “from 1950, only ten tropical cycles have been preserved within 320 km of Phoenix’s status of tropical storm or pressure below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane yet 64 km from the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Center for hurricanes predict the precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona sites up to 150 mm.
In other desert areas of the Northwest, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Masters will probably fall 25 to 50 mm, with local sections up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by the floods, Rosa rain can be a blessing because the area has affected dryness.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitation may also help somewhere, because the Southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
The serverweather.com states that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is at least “extreme dry”, the second highest category.
The path of the hurricane Rosa will first lead to Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the strength of the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet with the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus will lose its power.
It is expected that Mexico will arrive on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the precipitation will be strong, which represents a great risk of flooding.
‘In the area from Baja California to the Northwest Sonoru, total precipitation is expected from 75 to 150 mm, with up to 250 mm, the serverweather.com.
Rosa then wanders as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and on Tuesday, in the morning hours arrive at Arizona's border, then passes through Arizona and on Tuesday late evenings enter the southern Utah.
“It is expected that the main risk of Russia or its residues will be very strongly precipitation in Baja California, the Northwest Sonora and the U.S. desert Southwest,” informs the National Center for hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause fatally dangerous floods and streams of sutin in the deserts and landslides in a mountainous terrain.

Trump says that Kavanaugh “tested the wickedness and anger - Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugha is a refusal of the carefree and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump on the possession in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh had “tested the wickedness and anger during his nomination process, ” the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, where he definitely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's incitement that several decades ago when they were teenagers, he sexually assaulted her.
Ford also talked about her accusations.
On Saturday, the President said that “the American witnesses of Kavanaugh’s glory and quality and courage were“
As his supporters from West Virginia said, “the vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the most brilliant legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent service to the public at the end.
The President, indirectly, objected to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
“ Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still moving,\" he said.
“For this, I am fighting everywhere for great candidates -

The consultant of the Republic's management said CNN station that the first key procedural vote on the Kavanaugh nomination on the ground of the Senate is expected not later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is still growing
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit large earthquakes and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of whom washed out the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in the town of Palu, hundreds of people met at the festival on Friday. However, in the twilight the coast hit up to six meters of waves that many people killed and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The deep tsunami preceded an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami was discovered yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and immediately did not escape, so they fell for the victim,” said the spokesperson of the Indonesian agency to mitigate the collapse of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on the brifin in Jakarta.
“The wave of the tsunami did not go alone, took cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground,” said Nugroho and added that, before the impact on the coast, the tsunami on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees and survived before the wave.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the Palu.
Air photography, which the agency published for the relief of disaster, shows many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and meshat covered with water.
As a result, the coastal city was shaken even on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was to feel in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Agency for Technology Evaluation and Application (BPT) has stated that the energy released by Friday's strong shocks was about 200 times greater than the force of the nuclear bombs destroyed during World War II in Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could increase the tsunami wave.
Nugroho described damage as “a large one, ” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found sealed under the ruins of the abandoned buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho informed that the amount of victims and damage could be greater on the coast of 300 km north of the Pal, in the area called Donggala, which is near the earthquake epicentre.
According to him, the communication “was completely baptized without any information from Donggaly.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300 000 people lived in the area, and added that the affected places were directed by its workers and volunteers.
“It’s tragic, but it could get even worse,” says the statement.
The agency took significant criticisms on Saturday because it did not inform that Palu hit the tsunami waves, even though the authorities said the waves came at the time of the warning.
On amateur images shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the upper floor of a building desperately warns people on the street before approaching the tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coast hits a water wall that carries buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami caused a large loss of electricity, which interrupted communication in the area of the Pala, so the authorities could only closely coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending freight carriers with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transporting assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to over 800.
That's too bad.
When the workers of World Vision from Donggala arrived in Paulu, where employees hide in shelters from customs built on the front yard of the office building, they saw the images of destruction, says Mr. Doseb.
“They said they saw a lot of damaged houses, ” he adds.
It's too bad.
When helping groups initiated a sad activity of aid in disasters, some complained that foreign workers with great experience had not been able to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, it may start flowing funding, supplies and staff from abroad until the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the level of the province,” says the spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross of Aulia Arriani.
“As the government says “OK, this is a national disaster,” we can start international aid, but that is not the case yet.”
When on Paul’s second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still missing, they were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that set aside the anointed stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the can on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was arrested for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists on Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon cured how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the end of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages over WhatsApp competing from the Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, but instead of a pair of blue ticks, ended with a grey sign.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he says.

Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kane West is changing his name - to Ye.
The change announced on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “Be formally known as Kanye West,
One-four-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
Change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace the singer Arian Grande, who has cancelled her participation on “cital reasons,” as the creator of the show said.
West has already said that the word for him has a religious meaning besides shortening the existing professional name.
“In my opinion, “ye is the most used word in the Bible, where it means “you”, ”” West heard this year when he spoke of his album with Big Boy Radio.
\"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to the mere Ye, as just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are, -
The name changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known at different times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names of Love (love) and Brother Love (breast Love).
Former West co-worker JAY-Z wrote his name with a connector and without him and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador committed that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “it will never use the troops to attack the Mexican people.
At a time when the left student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 started shooting at people for peaceful demonstrations in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Orador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to students and opening up additional free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education would lead young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount that they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after different parts of the U.S. government published announcements about AI, although the US as a whole does not have any formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China has, in the meantime, introduced a plan that says she wants to be one in innovation AI by 2030.
\"AI'd be a good start to double the AI research budget since all other countries are far beyond the US and we're looking for another breakthrough in AI,\" says Lee.
Lee said this week in an interview for CNBC that double funding could double the chance that the next big discovery in the area of AI will be made in the US.
Lee, who published this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, published his book “Supervelmosis AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on the AI system, which exceeded the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was the head of Microsoft research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous technological competition of the U.S. Government, such as the Robotic Call of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be more to help identify a new visionary.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have a hard time trying to get government grants.
“Akademic tips do not lead China, but corporations,” says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies employ the best experts from the university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve the efforts in the field of AI, according to Lee, the United States could also help change immigration policy.
“In my opinion, doctors in the field of AI should automatically offer green cards,” he says.
The China State Council issued a development plan for artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way, as the National Science Council and other government organisations give money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence to involve partners from the industry and from the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of a Selection Commission for artificial intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it will invest USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonia’s people voted in a referendum on whether the country’s name was to be changed to “the North Macedonia Revolution,” which would solve several decades of old dispute with Greece, which blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor is entitled to its territory and therefore included the entry of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded in June an agreement on a proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the voters will arrive in order to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: “You are for membership in NATO and the EU with the arrival of an agreement with Greece -
The beneficiaries of changes in name, including the Prime Minister Zorana Zaeva, claim that this is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, could enter the organisations like the EU and NATO.
\"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, to live freely under the European Union's roof, because it means a safer life for us all,\" says the 79-year-old Oliver Georgia of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote.
The change in name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters finally received their vote.
“I went to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjos Tanevski, 62-year-old voters from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and the son of Dushko, will give their votes in the Macedonian referendum to change the name, which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumice in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, small podium and pulls chairs out of tents built by people who fight referendums.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter into them with the head of the noble, not the door for the maid,” says Kavadarkov.
“We are poor but we have pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, so much investment needed.
“I think that the large majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zev said after he voted out.
The result “yes,” according to him, would be“ a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday, a referendum could take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters, which is less than the required participation.
In another survey organised by Telma TV Macedonian Station, 57 percent of respondents were found to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order to be successful, 50 percent plus one voter must lose it.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious wound to the policy of the Western government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has come for a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday they took out Brighton defense, so they secured Manchester City winning 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At Aguera administration, his goal looked ridiculously easy in 65 minutes.
It all started with an adventure that the Argentine attacker got at the center of the field.
He debuted between three Brighton Defenders and got into the open space.
Aguara then surrounded four green dressings.
On the edge of the penitentiary territory of Brighton, one defender has gone around and a few others have passed.
He found Sterling as a follow-up to the left.
The English attacker cursed the ball in the fine territory back to Aguer, who played the right-hand goalkeeper Brighton Mathewa Ryan with a bullet on the right side of the net.

Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the fight for playoff, there were not many reasons to come again.
But Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will stand on the pitch of the pitcher in the match against Colorado Rockies - but only if they have the Rockies, who lead in NL West for one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for playoffs.
Rockies secured at least a wild card by winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I’ll experience this year.
Why wouldn't I play it?
The Nationals have not yet reported who will begin on Sundays, but apparently, they tend to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be a 34th start. On Thursday, he would train and pitch on Sunday when he usually has his day off.
In this season of statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump went to a meeting in West Virginia
The President, indirectly, expressed the situation around his candidate for Judge Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we have done will be at stake.
One of the most important choices of our lives remains five weeks.
It's one of the big, big, I'm not running, but we're still moving, and I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You see the terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by means of any means necessary, and you see the wicked, the repulsion.
They don't care who they get hurt, who they have to turn to get power and control, that's what they want, power, and control, we don't give it to them.
The Democrats, according to him, decided to \"support and obstruction.\"
“ And you see it in the last four days, ” he added and said that the Democrats are “agitated and angry and disgusting and lying - lying -
He mentioned, on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Court, the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud awakening of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, wait--that was a really bad speech of the body--the worst speech of the body I've ever seen--
The Labourist Party is no longer a dilated view current.
He's intolerant to those who express their opinions
When the activists at Momenta voted in my local side for my reminders, it was no surprise.
After all, I have been the last of a series of Labour MEPs who have said that they are not welcome, because they have honestly said their views.
With my fellow parliament, Joan Ryan was treated like this because anti-Semitism was in isolation.
In my case, I was criticized by the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, the paradoxically similar issues Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Labour Meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East, it was said that “we want the meeting to be accessible and productive. ”
Most of the eight years I've been a local member of the parliament for a labouristic side were the exact meeting of the GC on Friday night.
Unfortunately, in today’s day, most of the meetings are not going forward, and the “greater, milder,” the policy was long forgotten if it had ever started with him.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed whether they are acceptable to the direction of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader. The colleagues I thought of earlier were having similar political views, they suddenly expected me to turn around 180°, and I would retain positions that I could otherwise agree with - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak public - and it does not matter what I say - then there is a lot of supply on social networks, where they call for my appeal, they condemn the policy of Wednesday and tell me that I should not be on the labourist side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for professionalism and determination of those, colleagues who face sexual favors or racist insults every day, but never retreat.
One aspect of this policy era, which I am most disappointed with, is how insults become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer this diverse view stream and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of selection becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I have been advised many times to stay back, not so much to speak, and then “I will be fine. ”
But that's not what I went to politics for.
Since 32 years ago, as a student of school entered the Labour Party, I was shocked by the negligence of the Government of Margaret Thatcher, which allowed my class of general school literally to fall apart, I tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as local councillor or government minister.
I've never concealed my politics or my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would say only that when the country is looking towards Brexity, which harms the household, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labourist Party.
However, my main message is not intended for the Moment in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting according to what I think is best interested in you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late fives had a little bit of an end result, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazing fun game of Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're at the front of the table, like the only non-proliferation.
Finally, it was an excellent defence and a better use of chances, which led home to victory, and the coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
“In our fights we have passed through great trials and we are still inconclusive, so I must be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All honours of Ayru have been taken better than we have -
Five Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, turned by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who had released the Warriors for the match, enabled Melros to use the number of advantages and Jason Baggot received an unaltered five.
Climo raised the lines of Ayru penalta and then then scored exactly in half-life and turned solo attempt, so it adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and five Patrick Anderson, turned Baggot, reduced her lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knottt, who left the playground on the stretches, and when it started to play again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, which he turned Climo.
The representative Captain Ayru Blair Macherson then received a yellow card and Melrose once again took advantage of the players thanks to Bruce Colvin's unaltered five after a short strong pressure.
Of course, the houses came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for assaulting Clima without ball, MacPherson from the penaltation set laid the ball behind the moving maul Ayru.
Climo turned again, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent down Gregory Henry's wing for the fifth home five.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It appears that the star of Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the field of hospitality.
The six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show that writes and plays along with Greg Hemphillo's long-term comedy partner.
The two reported that the coming ninth series would be the last series of series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the statement from the official register, Adriftmonne Limited is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but the source of the Scottish Sun daily indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the “prosperating business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: the inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines guard at La Paz sea headquarters, which is decorated with ropes.
Over public buildings, blue flag in the ocean color.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described by the password: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to get it.
There is still a living memory of the coast that the country has lost in the benefit of Chile in a bloody war about the sources of the 19th century, as well as the desire to re-circle the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the largest in several decades, because Bolivia awaits the decisions of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolívia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result,” says the Bolile diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many of the Bolivians will follow the decisions of the MSD on large images across the country hoping that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile is obliged to act on the fact that Bolívia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
Charismic native president of Bolivia Eva Morales, who has a controversial battle to re-elect next year, is also very interested in Monday's decision.
“We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court should decide in favour of Bolivia - and even if it did, it would not change much.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign to someone of the Chilean territory and said that it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that MSD's decisions come only six months after the last arguments were raised shows that the case “was not difficult, as the Paz Zárate, the Chilean Department of International Law.
And for the last four years, they didn't just support the matter of Bolivia, but maybe they've got it colder.
“The question of access to the sea has been strengthened by the existing Bolviian government,” says Zárate.
He adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will act again once again, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to conduct a discussion.
Both countries haven't changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haag, refused to think that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday, Bolívia will bring “a unique opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile, and a chance“ to end 139 years of failure to match each other’s benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - to use the question of the sea as a political barrel.
“Bolívia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past -
North Korea says that there will be no nuclear weapons unless the US can trust.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his people will never arm their nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the General Assembly on Saturday.
He invited the United States to make promises given to the sum of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that's stuck on a dead end, more than three months for the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says that “the hope is that the ongoing sanctions and objections of the US against a declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes break the North on its knees.
Washington is careful about the consent of the declaration if Pyongjang does not take significant steps to armament first.
Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a general skepticism that Pyongjang is serious about the disappearance of this arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongjang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that your fashion stores will soon arrive the latest trend of huge head covers
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of mutilated huge head covers for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a show that has captured all of them at the Paris fashion week.
Very uncircumcised hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creatures to the pier.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was a superstitious beige hat with a wide edge resembling feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other excessively large supplements were decorated with melons, a witch hat and even ananas - but they are not designed to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks tend to cover their lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature resembled dive equipment and with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a root with ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could also reach fashion stores.
The oversized hats come after “La Bomba, a sleek with a half-meter wide crempo, which everyone wore from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cultural brand behind this very unoccurable hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the show pier - a salty beach bag, which is almost as large as the model in a swimmer carrying it.
Dark orange raffle bag painted by rapific shakes and bearing handle from white skin was on the Paris week fashion with an exhibition piece of the collection La Riviera spring/atto 2019 from Jacques.
The celebrityist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer - given that the designer had such a great success, it would be difficult to ignore demand for excessively large supplements -
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes, and this continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, artistic, musical and other community activities are only undercut.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, representing them the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (The Scottish Council of Independent Schools) and trying to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as a global citizen.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with a person the language he understands, it goes directly to his head.
If you speak his own language, it goes directly into his heart.
The point is that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely on English only.
The latest results of this year's trials show that languages are first placed in tables, with independent schools not increasing their success rate.
A total of 68 percent of pupils learning foreign language achieved the best sign A.
The data collected from 74 member schools of SCIS show that the highest grade A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent German students, 69 percent French students and 63 percent Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages like subjects chosen by pupils are equally weighted in study plans of independent and other schools as well as STEM objects (knows, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The study carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skill in 2014, showed that for reasons that employers show as problems in serving available places, 17 percent of the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly necessary when preparing young people for their future career.
Given that more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whether you choose any career if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future that has such lifelong skills.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, people who speak more languages will automatically benefit from competition.
According to a survey organised by YouGov in 2013 between 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, with the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, was French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language teaching.
If children know more languages, especially those developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school is different by what language it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages in independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever is in the future.
At this point, it cannot be said that languages are vitally important in the global business environment for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as ‘national communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and meaning to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will be introduced on Sunday in San Diego for the first time in the Lakers dressing
Fans who look forward to LeBron James coming to Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will soon be waiting.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play the Sunday opening game of the previous season in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll lose.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James will probably only play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James asked about his plans for six Lakers matches in the foreword.
“At this stage, I don’t need presidencies,” he said.
Trump's show in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, will start a campaign touring wave.
It's the first of five possessions scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a release place in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to obtain support for the mid-term elections, as the Republicans stand in November elections against the risk of loss of Congress.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's possession in West Virginia online below via live data on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearing of the candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very excited about the charges of inappropriate sexual behavior. He is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be suspended one week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main objective of this wave of herbs is to help the Republicans to take a step ahead of November's choices.
According to Reuters, the campaign organizers of President Trumpa say that these five meetings next week are aimed at ‘ adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
“The control of the Senate is so important for its agenda that the President is going on in this busy season of campaigning to as many states,” said the Reuters spokesperson of Trump’s campaign, which he did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could come to supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania, and he could be watched by the media from Pittsburgh”
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey who is staying in his research.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that he has to come to the President to help him in the surveys,” says Reuters, a political scientist at Simon Haeder University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has shown that he has a stomach to fight to keep hope from Sunday singles
After three unilateral games, Saturday couples can be just what Ryder Cup needed.
A swinging shuttle is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe him, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the shuttle coming from now?
“They took six points, and now it's four, so we take it so that the shuttle is probably moving a little towards us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, leads by four points and still remains twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal when he moved from the fire to the green and followed an example.
The famous screams even increased in the continuation of his bike when he managed the key foot to get the whole game when they were with Tomas after two holes at two backs.
His Putt, who won them the 15-hole match, met with a similar algae that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
“You really had to go deep and take care of your own game,” said Spieth.
That's all each of these players left behind.
18 hole left behind.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, indisputably the main story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but adorable couples from Europe are four of four, and they can't prove anything wrong.
“Moliwood was the only couple that missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning -
This course and the way the energy flows towards a stormy audience, and it confirms that these are the players of destination for Sunday's victory, and that until sunset over Le Golf Naitional will not be the more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best both of them are at the same time as a different hole.
However, European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked briefly with Sergi García, the hero of the morning game with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Jam and two dables on the front nine were buried in Spain and Swedes into the abyss, from which they no longer came out.
But no one will help you out of it on Sunday.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely monitor the interaction between people in pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't take, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant lead by the last day, but this game of two has also shown that the US team has a stomach for fighting about which some, in particular from states, doubted.
To the final day of Ryder Cup leads Europe with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup then from Saturday's games doubled to two balls came out with a lead of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly almost won twice over the fighting Tiger Woods, agreed to do four series in Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorne, who decided to keep the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the morning games of two balls with an American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, two games won, but they couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Furyka Page needs eight points from Sunday 12 games to keep a trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie who wins four points behind him, while he and Molinari, who received a nickname after a great weekend -Molliwood - are only the second couple who won four points from his four starting matches in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game for two balls, they also quickly beat the tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed the occasional brilliant flashes, but now he lost 19 of his 29 games in a double game for two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning game for two balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the game of double to 2&1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brookse Keepky - one and three in the world ladder.
But Europe did not have a fresh day south of Paris in this pleasant world.
The three-time leader Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas pulled two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game for two balls and returned later to defeat the two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game double, although two first holes lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returns from four-point deficit to two games, although as defending Furykov's party needs only a tie to get trophies.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that there is a Sunday counterflow behind them.
North Korea says that “in no way will be armed unilaterally and without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said that continued UN sanctions have deepened their distrust to the United States and, under such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual General Assembly that North Korea adopted “a major measure of goodwill in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the demonstration of nuclear testing sites and the promise that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not spread.
“We do not see a corresponding response from the US, however,” he stated.
“Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is not possible to unmanned itself on a one-sided basis.
While Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints regarding Washington’s resistance to “accidental” approach to denuclarisation, according to which North Korea would be remunerated for every gradual step, his statement appeared to be significant in the fact that it did not reject universal denuclarisation simply because Pchjongjang had already gone through the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working on “the denuclarisation of the Korean peninsula, while Trump promised security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the war conflict from 1950 to53, but the United States has said that Pyongjang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls for the release of hard international sanctions against North Korea.
“USAs insist on “denucerating the first” and increase the pressure on sanctions to force their targets and even object to “the declaration of the end of the war”“ said Ri.
“The fact that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust -
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader pointed out earlier in the United Nations last week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: “If South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a pessimistic situation,” said the Minister.
However, the tone of Riho's speech was dramatically different from that last year, when the UN General Assembly said that the focus of North Korea's rocket in the U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. evil president”, Trump marked Kim as “a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which threatened “the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to arm, but said that many work must still be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denucleurized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame, said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongjang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, the U.S. Foreign Affairs Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council that: “Proposing the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be violent and uninterrupted until we realize complete, final, certified denuclearisation.
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to deter the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly Party and Pompeo stated that next month they would visit Pyongjang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
From Pyongyang, he left July and declared that progress was made only to say about North Korea within a few hours that it was “gangsterian requirements“.
North Korea has committed itself to meeting Moon in this month to disassemble the rocket complex as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States adopt ‘responsible measures’.
He said that Kim announced that “the corresponding measures, in which he hoped, are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and directed to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard Students are taking part in a course to teach them sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year made all his students sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studios throughout the night when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
Students have learned that students at the world's most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of care for themselves.
The course designed Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a woman's hospital who thinks he's the first one of his kind in the USA.
He was inspired to begin the course after explaining the impact of sleepwalking on learning.
“ At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said: “Why are you telling me this only now, in my last year? ”
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of her sleep - which surprised me,” said The Telegraph.
The course, first presented this year, explains the basic information to students about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School, and Senior Director of Health Services of the University, said that the university decided to set up a course after finding out that the students were really not sleeping during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student dorms where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, tennis and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how the anesthetic performance affects the lack of sleep and the importance of the right sleeping habits.
In other parts, participants are informed of how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health,” said Professor Čeisler.
The culture of pride in “schooling all night ” still exists, added that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that even the problem of lack of sleep increases.
A lot of sleep good quality should be “a secret weapon, a student to fight stress, exhausting and anxiety,” he said - even so that there is no collection, because sleep depression turns the brain into a hunger regime, so that man is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student, helped Professor Cheisler design a course that was attended by one of his classes last year during Harvard's first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push on the course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competent institution.
The professor recommended students to consider setting the alarm for a time when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light”, emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can throw away your circus rhythm, which leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga drowned Gerrard's man
Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's treasured Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox was trying to record her first victory from 4 to 1 February triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave its post eight points from the leading leader Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-life and the Rangers compilation seemed to be uninhabited and determined to settle.
While Rangers are now down to the sixth place, Livingston lies on third and right behind the Hibernian team to the difference of one goal.
And it could be another issue of Rangers after the line referee Calum Spence had to be treated with head injury after he apparently hit an object from the auditorium.
Gerard made eight changes on his side, which went around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up a point of Hearts last week and would be pleased to see his well-trained men suffocating their opponents at every step.
Rangers may have held hold, but Livingston has done more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after the beginning when Menga first released Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the Warman buried his big chance.
A long free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the rear post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there would be more hope in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour mark when he and Steven Lawless broke down, but the referee Steven Thomson threw a Colombian challenge out of the table.
Rangers managed only two shots to target the first half, but the former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassany Coulibals and by a little shot by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener was 34 minutes away, no one could deny that they deserved it already.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Mengu to the easy finish.
Gerard took action during the break and replaced Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing went to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly fought from the line and the attack blocked.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game exactly the kind that they love when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long ball behind another.
The Holt's side was able to deepen its lead in the final phases, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow broke off the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim for punishment when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: The inventor of Geiger's Computer
And now the web page from our Almanach “Nieth of the Mornings: September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and still comes... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany “Hans - Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's computer.
At that time Geiger Counter became also a standing pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado, in the main role of those apparently unlikely Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger computer that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms of radiation emitted in minerals.
Evans: “Oh, yeah, now he really is in it.
“Hans - Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that carries his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system “seeing“ dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see - dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their conversion in the laboratory
Then they can “see a protein that is common to many cancers and then need to be injected again
Test vaccines show promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells, has missed ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so that they can “see“ protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-used into cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda in Maryland said: “Our results suggest we have developed a very promising vaccine,
HER2 “a number of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which immune cells were collected from patients and “he has learned to focus on cancer cells has already been promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-trump preaching in his magic hat after his performance at SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was set up at the Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance, during which President Donald Trumpa praised and said he'd run for the year 2020.
After the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which Mare America Great Again was wearing, he started spitting on Democrats and repeated his support to President Trump.
“ I often talk to white people, and they say to you: “How can you like Trumpa, he is racist?
If I were to blame for racism, I wouldn't have been in America a long time ago, I would have said.
SNL launched a show parody with Matt Damon in a major role in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on Raping Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't sent out, the footage of West's theater speech was recorded on the social media comic of Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to the viewers that his head decoration had been well eaten in the back.
“They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, “Do not go there with that hat.
That's bullied!
They also said that I was in the wrong place, said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the wrong place - and he added that he “has planted his superman suit, because that means you can’t say what to do - you want the world to move forward?
Try love -
His comments were only earned by the publication’s bucling at least twice, and SNL’s members looked worse, in despair, says Varieta, and one person even said: “The entire studio was quiet,”
Westa invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many present people by singing song I Love dressed for a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the manager of the TPUS conservation group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: JEY, SES POSAVIL DAVU -
But hosting talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West “just was who he is, and that's absolutely amazing--
“But I, NECHCI, reward someone (the purchase of his music or clothing or the support of his “carrying”), who I believe represents and sends to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.

Game Trones Star Kit Harington released into toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in hand in violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
Actor, 31 years old, but he got off the macho macho heroes and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel like they have to be claimed to earn respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that “someone is wrong,” he asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculine in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his star Star of Rose Leslie’s throne, also admitted that “docela is strongly speaking about this problem.
“ At this moment, I personally feel quite strongly - what happened so bad with maskulinity - he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see here now?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do you guys learn on TV, on the streets, from them feel like you need every man to have a side like that?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because young men have certainly changed to worse.

HIV/Aids: China says 14% increase in new cases
China announced 14% of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820 000 people are affected according to official numbers.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread over some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people in charge of HIV was reduced almost to zero by Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people year-on-year.
HIV transfer through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is allegedly still widespread.
In view of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with men are finally married to women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from lack of sexual protection in these situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters insists that staff would escape the GOP data of senators, depending on the terms “insecure lies” and “conspiracy theory”
On Saturday, the American Member of Maxine Waters judged that a member of her staff sent personal data to three Republican American senators on the Jagitimers' website.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the charges were supported by “ultravatics, scientists and websites.
“The lies, lies, and other depraved lies,” said Waters in her Twitter statement.
The information reported included home addresses and telephone numbers for American senators, Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and published it by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during the Senate's hearing on sexual abuse charges by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
There were times when the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which sources of contributions, is linked to Waters' office and published information on the staff of Waters, says Hill.
“This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
‘The head of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened by such fraud and false accusations - was in no way responsible for the escape of this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie -
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including the one from the former Press Secretary of White House Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry, ” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have a temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't be rude.
He must not question the motives of the applicant.
He must be calm and not be disturbed.
It seemed that Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters with the criticism of Democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, which was criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the elections against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
\"If it were true, it would be something - tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office highlighted “the competent authorities and the institutions acting in criminal proceedings on these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous for everyone and all my staff members.”
Johnny English again interferes with the review - the weaker spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for Brexit in every new film with British tendencies, which seems to be the case of this reanimation Johnny English in the series of action parodys - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this rough satira be on the subject, how obviously the bad nation are we, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this calculated, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to reverse this thing in a completely new way - that name more than anything else signal that is broad comic production designed for the neanglicks talking cinematographic audience.
He, of course, is the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims for the smootie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a spy from Mr. Bean and a big piece of that guy who has succeeded in a single tone in the concept of Chariots of Fire at the Celuseau's Celusau in London 2012.
The construction is also originally based on travellers and an international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard, leaving chaos behind.
In this last edition, there is one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the medieval armor and the blade of the rotor briefly referred to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite overexploited and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible alone now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being intended for children than adults, and for me, the crazy troubles of Johnny English are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gaga in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that Great Britain has serious problems.
The cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to inherit an agent in the service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pumped and captured figure that already suffers under the complete collapse of political inhumanity: Emma Thompson's likes Theresa May's character plays the best, but there's nothing in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that once every spy's active is at risk, she'll have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English itself, which is now employed as a director in some luxurious facility, but at the same time he gives record lessons about how to be a secret agent: there are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to rock school.
English came back to Whitehall for an emergency regiment and met with his former long-term suffering partner Bough, once again playing Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the sub, an infected character that may even waste some time with Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin in the burning tasks for her Majesty's secret service are back in action and meet with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullete, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the spell of the Charisma technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the evil Jason Volt that Jake Lacy plays.
English and Bough begin their departure full of frassurable floors: masked as waiters will burn the French restaurant; create chaos when they are smuggled on the deck of Volt's luxury yacht; and English will launch pure anarchists when they try to get to know the virtual reality with the interior of Volt's house.
All the essays are definitely ready for this last sequence, but whatever it is, it has something in it from children's TV.
It's kind of a dying thing.
And as with other films of Johnny English, I couldn't think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that actually matches his talent?
Labourists insist that they develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and they will be paid in five.
Apparently, the party wants the bosses to hand over savings to the workers, which will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
The resources claim that this idea would “have been put into the economic agenda of the Party and plan to favour the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way that workers can use a changing economy.
A long-term laboratory member said to Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that falls within the position of the party to balance the economy in favour of both the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the Party,
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
He said: “The four-day working week is not our policy, and the party takes no account of it.
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to complete his vision of the Social Revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell stated that it is determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “signors” in potable companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their overall share because the Labour Government could carry out “discretions, based on perceived commissions.
He also confirmed plans to place workers in the management board of the company and to set up own funds that transfer 10% of their own capital to employees who are entitled to payment of annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy said on the “60 minutes” show, whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has given its last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether finding the Authority could be swinging some Republican senators to attract their support.
In the Sunday interview “60 minutes”, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"I want to say, of course,\" Kennedy said.
“I said that I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charges came out, and he said: “You did it.
He was determined, determined, clear -
Graham's decision, however, is inconclusive.
“With Brett Kavanaugh, I have already made my decision, and it would mean really explosive accusations,” he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard,\" gave Graham a link to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And none of those whom she appointed could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see something's going to change--
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has he done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York every year, offering a very impressive number of stars and an impressive mission for the end of world poverty.
Global Citizen Festival in the seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was set up in 2012, is an extension of Global Powers project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions, such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, call or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case called “clickivism” - people who feel that they sign online petitions or leave tweets will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 he has recorded more than 19 million “actions, on the part of his supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to the fact that world leaders will notify commitments and measures of over $37 billion, which they have by 2030 affecting the lives of more than 2,25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British Partnership of Investors and Realizators, who have committed “to help children grow to their full potential - promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end the supply in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of British governments, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of a malnutrition in history,” Deputy of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman said the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 events which called upon U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which would address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty”
Global quote replied: “It will be a long and hard journey - we will sometimes fall down and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and the movement against the apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belongs to one of the participants in this year's year in New York, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy for “block” to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington is able to “where necessary” the U.S. Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner, said the United States Secretary of the Interior, in order to prevent the tension of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed that Russia's engagement in Syria - especially where it is at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to media energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
‘The countries concerned have the opportunity to make sure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market,’ he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the events organised by consumer energy alliances, which is a non-profit group that takes place in the United States as a “consumer of energy”
He compared Washington and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they were practically the same.
‘Economic possibilities for Iran and Russia are more or less invested in or replaced by fuel,’ he stated, while appealing to Russia as ‘unitive’ players with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement is coming because the Trump administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step aside from the “necessible” project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trumpa, made Berlin “rukojim“ Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $111 billion is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's zealous resistance towards the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of a unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure development and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after meeting American Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. again confirmed their commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the German Federation (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when the third State interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merckel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to “come closer to the presidency in 2020,” says Senator Massachusetts.
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that, on Saturday, after the elections in the mid-term elections, “it is close to looking at the president’s candidacy.
During the meeting of the Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the candidate.
“It is time for women to come to Washington and correct our broken government, including top female positions,” said The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will look closely at the Presidential run-in -
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that “he leads this country in a bad way, ”
“I fear until death the bones of what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open to his critic Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren stated that: “We need an FBI investigation prior to the vote.
However, the rest published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should run in 2020.
Sixty-eight percent “probably - voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the survey Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Davala Patrick's run-in, with 38 percent for the candidate and 48 percent against her.
Other highly built democratic names which were discussed in relation to potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his decision officially in January, reports Association Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after listing in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
“What my own son is going through after his return can relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” said the audience at meeting Donald Trump in Tuls, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “the elephant in the room, ” and she said about her son and other war veterans,“ they return a little different, they return to occupation, return and ask if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army give their country.

18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new measure of the US government, which is being put on the ground by a victim who is fleeing from a gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and periods on Friday in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and to question this measure, said the NBC.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace case v Sessions, which in August gave the Organization for Civil Liberties of Americans against federal politics, was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang had used it, but the American officials refused to apply for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the countries supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing all sorts of problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the US has reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal for immigrants from 2014, which has enabled illegal immigrants who flee from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The General Prosecutor Karl Racine of D.C. stated in the Friday declaration that the new measure “ ignores the decade of state, federal and international law;
‘The Federal Act requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such an obstacle violates this principle,’ says a short friend.
The lawyers further argued briefly that the policies that deny immigrants' entry harms the US economy and says that they are more likely to become businessmen and “will have the necessary work”
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the area of immigration not to give asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Azyl is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or because of political opinion,” said Sessions in his statement on 11 June.
Asyl was never intended to reduce all the problems - even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of victims has grown twice, race to search for survivors with time
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tight,” said Ris Kusum’s 35 - year - old mother, comforting her hot boy at the evacuation center in Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance will bring other bodies.
Clean water is rare -
The inhabitants were seen coming back to their destroyed homes, picking up through fake things and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were baptized.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractured the spine and shoulders, rested at Palu's army hospital, where the patients were treated out because of the continuing severe aftershocks.
The elephants filled his eyes with the idea that violent earthquakes were shaking up with a hotel room on the fifth floor that shared the room with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall, said Haris for Associated Press and added that his family was in town because of the wedding.
“ I heard my wife was calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay.
The US ambassador is accusing China of “suicing” propaganda advertising
The week after the official Chinese daily published four-page advertising in the American daily, which focused on mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the American ambassador accused Beijing from using the US propaganda press.
The American President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the payment of China Daily's contribution in Des Moines's register - the state of the largest sales newspapers in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to sneak into American congress elections in the USA on 6 November.
Trump's accusations that Beijing tried to get into American elections marked what the American leaders said was that Reuters was a new phase of escalating campaigns by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
Chinese retroactive sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador in China and former Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion in Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this bully by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press.
“In the dissemination of his propaganda, the Chinese government uses an American valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising on Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
“ Unlike the newspaper stand on Beijing, you will find limited dissents and you will not see any real reflections of unnatural views that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic path of China, given that the media belong to the company “the Chinese Communist Party”.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish the offer, although he did not say which newspapers.
Republicans leave their choices before their elections because of the debacle with Kavanaugh, warn analysts
How many top Republicans defend the candidate at the Chief Judge Brett Kavanaug, who is facing several charges against sexual assault, analysts warned that during the mid-term elections they would learn a response, especially from women.
The violence around this case was extremely high and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted the fact that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) would be working for the FBI's investigation at the last minute to calm down the voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow, and in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the lead adviser and spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, the newspaper at D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters experimented with “Lostage approaching,” said Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
“democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, a impartial political analyst.
“ People say it was already high, that’s true.
However, this could be higher, especially among the weighting women’s voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years who do not like the President but often do not come to elections.
Even before Ford's public witnessing in detail that accused her of sexual assault against a candidate of the Supreme Court of analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, he could follow the opposition.
“It was a confused GOP mess,” said Michael Steele, former Prime Minister of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not just a vote in committee or final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it is also about how the Republicans managed it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, the United States’ priority director, a group that helps vote for Democrats, pointed to the reporting channel.
However, Americans seem to be slightly divided into the opinion of who to believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the second appointed.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake FBI currently investigating the charges raised by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the party during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor is planning to start a new Internet and prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technological legends, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open source platform of Berners-Lee, called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt project was “world’s control“.
“We have to do it now,” he said about this startup.
“It’s a historic moment,
The application uses Solid technology that enables people to create their own “personal online data storage storage” or ‘inclusive data storage’.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Disk, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and at the same time.
What is special on a personal online data storage site is that it is entirely for users to determine who will have access to any kind of information.
This company calls it “personal data authorisation”
The purpose of the Inrupt project is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some of the employees working on the project, cooperated with the project and the community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
‘We don’t ask for their permission,
In his contribution to the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will be founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The spiritual celebration received by Victoria Cross during World War I
There have been a celebration of a hundred years since the only spiritual Church of England gained a cross as a warrior during World War I of Victoria.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him and he never knew he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandkids showed him a memorial stone on Saturday at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his right-hands, Michael Vann, said that it was “genically symbolic,” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s winning work.
According to the London Newspaper magazine on September 29, 1918, the Colonel Lt Col Vann led his Battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin very thick fog and strong shooting from field cannons and cults.
Later, he got to the first line and with “most courage,” he led the line forward before he turned himself into a firefield and knocked three separated units.
The Colonel Vanna killed the German shooter on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said that the actions of his grandfather were “something I could never, but at the same time something which is humiliating.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the show that was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band group, they set up a dowry.
Michael Vann said that “he felt great honor that he could participate in the show, ” added, “the hero’s hero’s chorabost is shown to be the support that a lot of people will provide. ”
The MMA fans stayed all night to follow Bellator 206, instead they got the pig Pepp.
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the overcrowd Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcast took place in Great Britain all night on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald prepared for each other's game, the audiences in the UK remained amazing when the intelligence changed to the show about Peppa's press.
Some remained uninterrupted after the early morning hours were awake because of the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in broadcast to the kids as “a certain form of bad joke”
“The government’s regulation is not appropriate at 6 am, and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, the higher vice president for marketing and communication Bellator after he was asked for this transfer.
‘Peppa pancake - yes -
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they would work on the program so that the audiences in Great Britain would be involved in the future.
“I think when I think about the broadcast, we can probably handle it,” Cooker said.
\"But there's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't make it into Sunday's time, Monday's time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program changed, there were lots of texts going back and forth and not all were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We reduce it to five games instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried to keep our promises to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation--
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “at least, because of sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daley says that he grew up with a feeling of less valuableness toward all because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to go for success.
24-year-old sportsman stated that he did not realize “not all of them are like him,” he said.
On the first discussion, Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, said that he spoke out loudly about gay rights to give others “the hope, ”
He also said that thanks to the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Regular moderator for the long-term program Kirsty Young had several months off for illness.
Daley, who appeared as a troupe in Laverno’s first program, said that he felt “less less valuable than anyone who grew up with him at the same time, because “it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls“
He said: “When these feelings were so far less valuable and otherwise real things that gave me strength and power to succeed, ” he said.
He wanted to prove that he was “somebody, ” he said, not to disappoint anyone who might find out how it was with his sexuality.
Double holder of the Bronze Olympic Medal has become a fighter for the rights of the LGBT movement with a high profile and took advantage of its presence at the Commonwealth game in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said that he heard from him because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and want to add to others “the hope. ”
This triple world champion said that he was in love with a man - American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “stoughly unprepared -
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older, took over last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“If you experience so much at such a young age, he was at his first Olympic age when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later on cancer,” he said that it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar heights and falls.
Two in June adopted Robert Ray Black-Dudey's son and Daley told him that “the whole angle of view changed“
“If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of “I want to get a gold medal”, he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic Medal.
My Olympic Medal is Robbie -
His son got his name after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't deal with dying, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets for the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him,” he said.
“I held him by my hand when he stopped breathing and when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not inviolable,” he said.
Daley attended the Olympics in 2012 and gained a bronze.
“I knew that I had dreamed of it all my life - to jump before the eyes of our domestic games in Olympics, I do not know the better feeling,” he said.
This was also inspired by the selection of his first composition - the Proud from Heather Small - which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still produced goose skins.
The Desert Island Discs show is sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up in Ryder Cup on Saturday at the bench
The American Phil Mickelson would have reached a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have to blow out the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at events held every two years on a record of twelfths, sent Captain Jim Furik at Saturday football and football on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as it often used to be in the US, he spent his five-fold main winner his day soberly between cheerleaders and work in a row he hoped to correct what he was suffering from.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the top of his career, so it's not an ideal choice for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where long divided terrain routinely punishs stray bullets.
And if the golf course isn't very worrying about itself, they're facing Mickelson in the ninth Sunday game of the top British Open Francesc Molinarim champion, who won all four of his matches this week in the team with Tommy Fleetwood's new boyfriend.
If the Americans, who had four points less, began 12 separate swords, avoided the fast launch, Mickelson's machete could prove to be absolutely fundamental.
Furik expressed confidence in his husband and gave nothing else.
“He totally understands the role that he had today, he paid me back, gave me his hand around his shoulder and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“That much he believes.
He is a member of the Senate of straw and in the past this week, he has been so beneficial for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine losing two machetes.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else--
Mickelson plays Nick Fold's record in most of the West Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which has never reached a height of its individual record.
Mickelson reached the 18th win, 20 pros, and seven remes, even though Furik says that his presence of the team has yielded some insignificant results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make people laugh and is a great companion in the team’s room, ” he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun that they went to see him this week, which was fun to observe.
It gives much more than just a game -
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, has learned from experience that the great leadership leading to singles from recent days at Ryder Cup can easily change to an uncomfortable ride.
Data debuted at the match in 1997 in Valderram, where cooperatives led by Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over Americans, but to the finish plane they got completely tight welcome 141-2-131-2-131-2.
“You still need to remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only close,” said Bjorn, on the figure, after watching when 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of the team have shown me that it's not behind us.
You'll be completely bored tomorrow.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's what we're trying to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side - the best players in the world -
Bjorn, pleased with how his players led to a complicated golf course, added: “I would never manage it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
They're preparing individual performances tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you're supposed to be there on your own, your golf player capacity is fully checked.
That's the message you have to give to the players to get the best of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furik will take care of making his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have won three points from four.
Furik was personally on both sides of these great vomits, when he was part of the winning team in Brooklin, to end up being defeated when Europe reached “The Wonder in Medinah”
“I remember every damn word,” he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to go to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklin as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts considerable pressure on the middle matches.
According to this, we set up a lineup and made sure that the boys feel as you know, as if we should spell tomorrow--
Thomas was tasked to try to resist and stand up to Rory McIlroy in a top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half.
“I went with this group of boys in this order because I think he covered the whole trip, told Bjorn about his selection of singles.
The German new warship has yet to be reassessed
The latest German maritime fregata was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing warships from the age of the Cold War, but will not be available for at least one more year due to faulty systems and snowy coasts, reports local media.
The launch of the Head of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”- a whole new branch of Baden-Wuerttemberg class was according to Die Zeit’s sensitive spokesperson’s army, now postponed to the first half of 2019.
The fleet was supposed to be part of the Navy in 2014, but the challenging problems after the delivery have affected the fate of this ambitious project.
As a replacement for the ageing Bremen class fregate, four Bremen-Wuerttemberg vessels, which had already been ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircrafted ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Further important functions include a long maintenance period, the most recent fregatas should be able to be installed for up to two years outside the domestic ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the top seaships, which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces into overseas, will be obsolete until they were put into service, records Die Zeit's diary.
Neblaze famous F125 got into the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in operation and returned it to the Blodom & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship of manufacturers after transmission.
Only few were known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of fundamental “soft errors and failures on metal elements - failures for which the warship would be inadvertent to fight.
Software faults were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg vessel will operate a crew of some 120 sailors, which is half of the workers who needed to run the Bremen class fregdes.
It has also proved to have a largely excessive weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7 000 tonnes ship Rheinland-Pfalal will be twice as heavy as boats of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to weighting on metal elements, the price of the whole project is also the problem - including training crews.
It is said that from the original 2,2 billion euros, the price has increased to EUR 3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest fregations have been important especially in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power has fallen.
At the beginning of this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the seamen really “have been able to deploy ships”
This representative stated that the problems were continuously packed, since the old ships were removed from operation, but no replacement was granted.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's fregate was capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new research focused on the detection of bats using the landscape in food hunting is being conducted at the bats in Scotland’s village.
There is hope that findings of research will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will help guide future activities for the conservation of this kind.
The studies carried out by the National Trust for Scotland by scientists will follow the bats of starous and smallest even brown long and water in Invewe Gardens Botanical Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special record recorders will be placed in the key areas of this bat, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the entire annual period.
Employees and volunteers of NHS will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of bats and what individual types do.
A map of habitat will then be issued and a report will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the conservation of natural resources for the NTS, hopes that the results show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they use them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work such as the formation of meadows and the best procedure for maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The bats of the population in Scotland and the whole UK have been large in the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development that affects the colony and the natural environment.
The risk may also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful in hunting their prey than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to track bugs and obstacles in the flight.
The ETS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspection of colonies and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has even set up the first and only reserved bats reservation in the Threve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten kinds of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson's manager says it's an ideal territory for them.
\"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,\" he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here in other places will help us understand what they need for survival.
It highlights the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one parent nest can kill up to 400 females and youngsters, which could destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and illegal to kill them, harass them, disrupt or destroy their colony.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put her hand on the work and help.
She said: “We must learn much about our bats and many species that we do not know about how their population is.
Ronaldo refuses rape charges and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape charges as “false news, ” and stated that people “will want to see if they want to use his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed them of these charges.
This Portugueseec and the attacker for Juventus was accused of rapeing American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He subsequently paid her $375 000 to keep quiet about the case, and he informed Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the accusation, Ronaldo spoke in live video on Instagram to his 142 million monitor and referred to information as “false news”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news,” said the fifth-time award holder of the Golden Ball to the camera.
\"They want to feed on my face.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine,\" said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are planning to sue a journal by Der Spiegel from the accusations that they have referred to as “an unacceptable notice of suspicion in the private area”
The lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would be required to compensate for “moral damage at the level of the corresponding severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights recently,”
The alleged incident was expected in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and in the Las Vegas casino.
Following a confession at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly returned to the casino where, allegedly, she was raped by the documentation at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had been cursed after a alleged incident and told her that he had been “99 percent” - “cludas” and“ one percent - disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed he paid for sex, but that he was consensusal.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police to take pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because “she had fear of recovery, and was afraid of “public humiliation. ”
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to renew the procedure because she is an alleged incident still traumatized.
Ronald at the time of the charge of attacking the turkey from crossing to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer it was purchased by the famous Italian Club Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret losing car manufacturers
Great Britain “will forever regret - if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars, ” said a secretary for Greg Clark.
He added that it was “sortious,” said Toyota UK, that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production in Burnaston, near Derby.
“ The deal is necessary,” Clark said.
The Japanese car claimed that the impact of the delay on the borders in the event that the agreement on Brexit would not be concluded, can stand the jobs agreement.
In a race in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis brand Toyota were produced, they produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would notice stopping production in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnston.
Other cars, including the Honda car, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in Great Britain, are spreading fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW states that it will close its race for the production of Mini cars in Oxford just a month after Brexita.
The main concern is what producers indicate as risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of the supply of ‘manufacturing in time’, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU supplied for cars manufactured for order within 37 minutes.
If Great Britain left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to a delay and a lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in store at Derbyshire, the company, and thus the production would have stopped.
Mr Clark stated that Theresa May's plans to restore future relations with the EU are ‘ precisely calibrated in order to avoid such controls at the borders’
“We need a deal. We want to have the best business that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity,” said BBC Radio 4's Today.
‘The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a highly successful set of supply chains -
Toyota was unable to say how long it will be stopped, but in the long term it warns that the costs added would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually have been at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the president of the competition, said that they are still more concerned: “I have experience that once these sites disappear, they will never return.
Speakers said: “We have set a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, reports the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Advocate General Rosenstein could be “a week away for another week - because he continues to fight for the highest judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is working on a special board of Robert Mueller, which examines interventions in Russian elections, ties between Trumpy and Russians and possible judicial obstructions by the President.
Whether Trump releases the representative general agent and threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's knocks have been coming out of this for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times newspaper stated that Rosenstein discussed the camera wearing to record the conversation with Trump and the possibility of committing the president through the 25th add-on.
Rosenstein's report denied.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was at the seat of the United Nations in New York.
Trump stated that Rosenstein’s “departmentation” would not have left, but then a meeting was delayed to avoid hearing with the Senate’s court committee, where Kavanaugh’s witness statements and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate a weekly plea against Kavanaugh, which was delayed again with the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday's news on Fox Channel.
She replied: “The date has not been set yet, this week may need to be moved for another week, taking into account everything else that is taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and always tell the media about the current information -
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference with the White House since September 10th.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by an aversion to “the Court of TV reporters, although she said: “I do not agree with the fact that they will go out. ”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would grow.
“ The President has more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him,” she added without giving evidence. ”
The conference will continue, said Sanders, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying and seeing that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and that the press conference will be held where you can talk to the President of the United States -
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with visiting High Representatives.
The press conference itself is rare.
This week, in New York, the President probably showed why he was free and sometimes bizarre in front of the collected reporters.
The Minister of Health writes EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to employees from the EU who work in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's SME sent a letter not even six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to tackling the costs of applications for settlement of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations between the Great Britain and the EU over the summer have continued on their way to the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British Government also takes steps in preparation for a possible withdrawal scenario without an agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to make sure that I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
The EU-wide colleagues also bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial for patients and communities that we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our sincere wish is to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tigers, out of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgical procedure after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores opponent, said Mike Body of Tennessee.
The main coach of the State of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and nurses gave Abercrombie to the frontal line of oxygen and then put it on the stretcher and prepared for a further assessment.
The trustee from Tennessee told Chrisz Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had a surgical procedure at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no “no details of the type/response of injury” available yet and that he was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in red shirt, graduates the first season for the state of Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total steps, which means a total of 18 steps in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate tax when buying real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate tax when they buy real estate in Great Britain, with extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's tahu, whose aim is to attract young voters
Increased duty on higher property taxes will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The increase in the Treasury by £ 120 million per year is expected to help people without home
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy real estate in the UK, with the extra money being used to help people without home, they will now notify Theresa May.
This action will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of pulling Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters with the arrival to provide affordable accommodation and focus on high income people.
Increased property tax will be related to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, with money strengthening government efforts to fight sleeping without roofing over their heads.
A supplement which is a supplement to the current obligations of the purchase tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago at the second home and buying for rent, may reach up to three percent.
It is expected that in the Treasury, funds will be increased by up to £ 120 million per year.
Estimates say that the newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, leading prices and making it easier for those who buy for the first time to get to the ladders of the house.
Many of the rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, became “a city of spirits, just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the property purchase tax to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large building companies of keeping their real estate prices high by preventing land but not using it, and insisting on Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable houses to repair “free home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of proposed housing reforms, including rent management, and the end of “inadequate - eviction.
He also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “I said last year that I wanted to give my effort as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, so that every new generation should have a better life.
And that means correcting our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for those who do not live in Britain and foreign companies to buy houses as hard as the hard-working residents of Great Britain.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too remote and the tension of sleeping without a roof above their heads is too real -
Jack Ross: “My highest ambition is to drive Scotland.
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that his “most ambitions ” are to be the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scotland is looking forward to calling for the renewal of the North-East Club, which currently takes third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he went to Stadium of Light after he led St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got rank B and it was,\" said Ross on the BBC Scotland's Sportssound channel.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with Daddy when I was a child, and that's always something that will bring me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in leading the club -
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland were: Dick Advocaat, David Moyas, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief of Alloa Athlatic says he didn't feel any anxiety from the persecution of such introduced names in such a big club when he rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town earlier.
“The rush at that time would be a matter of whether I could return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It is not an easy task to put him back there, but I guess I would feel successful if I could return the club there only if I could return the club.
Ross's career was only three years before, he worked as a helpful boss in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then the Alloa Club helped recover from the third group and transformed St Mirren from the starting downfall at the winner of the title of masters immediately in the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossroad, ” recalls the time the Alloa took place.
“I truly believed that leadership was true to me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, he made good money, and he was enjoying a reasonable amount.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you need to go through a week.
I keep going through the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in line.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I do it, I feel like now I feel the most comfortable in my whole adult life in my skin -

Summer wave vender increased revenue of British pubs facing difficulties, but increased pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Numbers show that groups of pubs and bars recorded an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but the revenue of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consulting company CGA, who produced the final report, said: “The stable sunlight and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the July followed a similar pattern as the previous June when the economy had increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
Pokles the restaurant market by 1.8 percent in June has even worsened.
The pubs and drinks bars have so far been more powerful than the restaurants have worsened.
Hospitals whose main market is from food also suffered by the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6,6 percent per month, while the sale of food by three percent decreased -
Paul Newman stated from an analytical company of leisure activities and hospitality: “These results are the continuation of the trend that lasted from the end of April.
Weather and impact of major social or sporting events are the largest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chain continues to fight, although the annual decline in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of ongoing pressures on costs.
The long hot summer can't be a worse time for food business operators and the time will tell if the milder temperatures we've experienced in August will bring so much relief needed.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffee Tracker Sales Monitor for the British Economic, Bar and Restaurant Sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, which is a established industrial scale in the industry.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that are hiding from parents
Every fifth child, aged only 11 years, has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and pedagogists, shows research
Research between 20,000 secondary school pupils showed an increase in “false instagram websites”
Reports have raised fears that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of pupils said that they had “the main account that parents know about
Every fifth child, aged only 11 years, creates accounts in social networks that cover their parents.
The study between 20,000 secondary school pupils showed a rapid increase in “false instagram accounts” on which photographs are shared.
Reports show concern that there is a publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of pupils said that they had a stolen “main” account that parents know about, while having a private account.
One mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found out that her teenager would encourage others to “be raped by them. ”
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) independent schools has shown that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half of them admits to conducting private accounts.
HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that he has so many teenagers of temptation to create online spaces where their parents and pedagogists cannot find them.

Milk collection calling Mother's comparison to the bars divides views online
The company dealing with the production of the decommissioning company divided online opinion by advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers to the cutting edge.
In the context of the placing on the market “first silent reschedules in the world - the company with consumer technology Envi released a music video with the superstitious, showing the freedom that the new crew gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of haystacks with songs: “Yes, I do, but you don’t see any tails - and “If you have not noticed that I have a vermin, there are my breasts here -
The congregation continues: “P pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, drink, drink my sweet milk. ”
A commercial that was published on the corporate Facebook page, however, produced an online controversial reaction.
Video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw him, while many of them indicated that it was the light on the “horry” industry.
‘A very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising on this product.
Just as we must be pregnant and born to give milk, but they are taken away from the children a few days after birth,” says one of the comments.
Elvie is placed discreetly on breast-feeding (Elva/mother)
Another comment: “A clear traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise on a breast pump for mothers who keep their children -
Someone else added: “This advertising is completely out of the way.
Even those who defended advertising appeared, with one woman admitted that the composition was “observable. ”
“This is a brilliant idea for me.
I'd get that pump if I'd still breast-feeding.
I feel like a cow when I'm draining.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's for the point.
It is a brilliant product,” wrote one user.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertising aimed at mothers who suck their milk (time at work or toilet) and feel like “weeds. ”
It is not an advertising that aims to praise or lose the dairy industry -
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they're all dancing with discreet suction bags hidden under the bra.
The campaign concept is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is absolutely quiet, has no wires or hoses and hides beautifully in the breast-feeding bra so that women give freedom of movement, the possibility of holding a child and even walking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and an ECD for mothers, added: “ Elvie's shipment is so revolutionary that it deserves a significant and provocative placing on the market.
By creating parallels between breast-feeding mothers and milk-fed cows, we wanted to point out the delay of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable feeling of freedom that will provide the new decommissioner.
It's not the first time Elvie's shipment got on the air.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mothers of Martha Jakubowski, who just used the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to the State Camp to the Texas border
In spite of the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in particular because tough rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump's administration have affected the establishment of children with an escort.
Most accompanying were traditionally formed immigrants without evidence that were afraid of threatening the possibility to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to a child.
The risk has increased in June when the federal authorities have announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the immigration and customs department, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who asked for an escort status of unfavored minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested have no previous criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the household sponsors are illegally in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them,” said Mr Albence.
According to asylum workers, officials in order to work more quickly on issues relating to children have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought to court within a month before the detention, instead of the former standard 60 days.
A lot will appear through a call within a video conference instead of personally declaring their case as legal status for the immigration judge.
Those who, according to the judgment, are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely he will experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to explosions of anger or attempts to escape, the workers of asylum facilities claim and report from the system over the last few months.
Advocates say that these concerns are increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is spending, with a greater probability of not being noticed, just because of the size of the facility.
They added that the transfer of children to a state camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or separation with friends could create a trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria has announced that they are to be American, French and Turkish ‘occupational ingredients’ are to be downloaded immediately
During his speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mual, also called after the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the eighth year of war in the country.
Moual, who is also the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian territory, under the premier of the fight against terrorism, and that “this is what will be based on“
“They must give up immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the assembly.
I insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over, with more than 360 000 people killed since 2011 and millions of others lost their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue in “the fight in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories, terrorist groups, and“ any illegally present foreigners, ” he said.
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, which mainly school Kurdian forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President President Bashar al-Assad and advises them.
France has more than 1,000 units on the territory of the war of the land.
When issuing refugees, Moual said that there are good conditions of return for them and accused “some Western countries, from “the escalation of immoral fears, ” which caused refugees not to return.
“We have addressed an international community and humanitarian organisation to make these returns easier,” he said.
“Perhaps what should be a purely humanitarian matter;
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no recovery aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations dplomat states that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last attack on Idlib created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
Russia-Turkey Agreement prevented the great attack of Syrian forces on the province of Russia, where three million people live.
However, Moual pointed out that the agreement had “of course given the final terms,” and expressed the hope that the military procedure would be focused on the Jajadists, including the fighters from Nusra Front, with a reference to Al-Qaedu, who “will be destroyed. ”
Member of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee meeting of government members and oppositions will soon take place to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
The Moual set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee in the words that the panel’s work should be restricted “to the control of the articles of the existing Constitution” and issued a warning before the procedure.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in other elections in 2020 if, as he probably hopes, many liberal observers, the prosecution, and scandalized his office at the President's office earlier.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history, ”
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue watching.
Since 2014, the ratings in the main transmission time increased more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average rating of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago by Nielsen and “The Rachel Maddow Show,” at MSNBC, increased the ratings on cable TV on 3.5 million watching main night reports.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we do not understand,” said Neal Baer, the operator of the “Designed Rawivor” program on the ABC drama about the secretary of the cabin, which became President after the attack destroyed the Chapter.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and the series “Just the Funny Parts: And and Few Hard Truths About Sneacking Into the Hollywood Boys - Club,” he has another theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before his election in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
Why?
“ He said: “Because it’s fun with him,” Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's a matter of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, a story that plays in Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wade, however the families of immigrants can reconnect and benefit the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged tracking.
And yet, it goes beyond whether you are a informed citizen when you are six hours watch a panel of experts who discuss how Bob Woodward uses “the deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” pstrates the leather jackets of Paul Manafort worth $15,000 (“the arogation of the arogration”, as said by Washington Post, and the consequences of the gross display “anatomy”, Mr. Trumpa Stormy Daniels.
Among other things, I won't look again at Super Maria in the same way.
“Reading what he does and causing the feeling of reality show is that something feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, the head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars document about the rotating c N.F.L. Trump show in which Kim Jong-un appreciates you.
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be behind.
When I joined Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, out on the northern bank of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was found inside and watched MSNBC and recorded CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was on the scales.
“ I remember doing all these crazy shows, and people said: “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out that they were right.

The money from the outside runs into the most tight domestic races of the medium-term election
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a financial present due to the reorganisation of congress districts, which generated two holders of the Bureau in the fight for the same chair.
This has recently led to the conversion of the suburban district Pittsburgh by the district democratic Republican Conor Lamb, which gained another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overseen with the new 17.
After the highest Pennsylvania court delivered an opinion in January that the old districts were unstoppably divided into the Republican's behalf, there was a recalculation of the map.
The race in the new 17th district began with a sharp financial debate between the financial branches of the main party, the Committee of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb in Pennsylvania became known after a tight victory in the monitored March special elections until the 18th congress district.
This chair has been occupied by the Republican and Donald Trump in the district has won by 20 points.
The policy experts give the Democrats a slight lead.
America considers fines Salvador as aid to China, then withdraws
The Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under a slight pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until the partners tried to eliminate the organizational team of Trump's leadership.
Directors of the Foreign Ministry decided that they would appeal to the U.S. diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “an recent decision not to acknowledge Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, spokesperson, in the statement delivered earlier than a month.
But fines were considered only against Salvador, which received an estimate of USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including the means to control drugs, development and economic support.
The fines proposed that involved shortening financial assistance and focusing on visa restrictions would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment.
Following the ongoing internal negotiations, the North American and Central American representatives took the high level conference on security and economic prosperity in connection with similar negotiations from the previous year, which was taken as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants going to the USA.
But by mid-September they explained to the leading administrative officials that they wanted to continue in negotiations and effectively put down any fines considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution of the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, within a signal which the administration has put in place on the agenda, to the diplomats.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic without having any new unbreakable reports from Washington.
The speaker of the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three American leaders, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their resources have been confirmed by an external analyst who has close to the government’s excruciation and has also spoken on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from a special committee on possible enforcement of Mr. Trump in the exercise of the law, which is now a lot of evidence in public records.
In his investigation Mr. Mueller has reportedly referred to whether Mr. Trump's campaign has not been a secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our election.
If there had been an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have had to apply himself to responsibility before this authority, as he is preparing himself to come back before the voters, and, eventually, he would have waited for a jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of \"if - and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - as is the case with similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long it will take.
In 1938 German officers were prepared to arrange a puddle against Hitler, only enough for the Western power to stand up to him and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History is about such critical moments that accelerate or slow the unexplained path of democracy.
Americans now stand a few similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein here, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein's had it on his mind since the report announced that last year he had secretly suggested recording the President and speculating that he was not healthy in order to be able to hold the President's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times are inconclusive.
“How do we react if the newly requested F.B.I.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair, or what if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite a convincing accusation of sexual assault and perjury?
And what's most important, we're going to vote in the middle of our term of office for Congress, which will bring Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe that we are not going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who deported in Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and then 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a table with a snack.
How could I not be an optimist about our future with such heritage?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the conflict with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers on Thursday guests of Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory over the Rakušans would have given them an impressive hand in Spain on the foot of the Villarreal earlier this month, gave them a great hope of the progress of the G Group of European League.
The knee injury prevented the supporter Graham Dorrans in order to appear on the field for the first time in the season up to 2-2 with Villarreel. However, they believe that Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge to bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with faith that we could steal something, and we took a point.
We may have been able to multiply it at the end, but overall it was probably just a tie.
They were probably better at the first half, but we were better at the second one, and we were better again.
On Thursday, it will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be hard, because in the last game they've played a good result, but with audiences behind my back, I'm sure we can push and it'll go well.
Last year was hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I'm feeling very good about it.
The team is strong, and the boys are really enjoying it, and training's good, too.
I hope we can turn ourselves into this now, throw the last season behind our head, and succeed -
Women worry about pension savings savings
Even though they had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in the national study stated that she had discussed the cost of long-term care with her partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“ People want to take care of them as a family member, but they do not agree to discuss it with him,” explains Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Insurance Company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your consultant and family, discuss where and how to receive care, because these factors can play a great role in determining prices.
Ask your financial advisor: The adviser can help you find a way to cover these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed through traditional insurance for long-term care, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay these expenses, or through own insurance using your own resources, as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles as long as you can.
You set up a health care representative, which will be a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you cannot communicate yourself.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will take a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are played if you do not make it possible.
Remember small details: Imagine that your old parent necessarily needs medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions regarding his medication and allergy?
Write these details into the written plan to make you ready.
“The games are not just finance, but, for example, what are the names of nurse doctors, Martin asks.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan ready for your hand -

Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are requesting a death penalty for Sayfull Saipova, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died, is an exceptional punishment that has not been awarded for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly in October he attacked the cycling route along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, using a rented truck Home Depot, which was washed by pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the applicants will have to prove that Saipov “will deliberately kill eight victims and“ have caused a number of injuries - this is how they define the terms of the intention to give death penalty according to the document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saipova of 22 crimes, such as murder charges in favour of blackmail, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” states the applicants and describes the way Saipov performed the act, as an awful, cruel and wrongful,
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijová, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendosis and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccica,” is mentioned in his intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York was the last given death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to lifelong withdrawal of liberty.
Last time, the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a married couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg had been executed, who had demonstrated a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19th, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbebekistán, showed a minimum regret by court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipo's accusation, he told the authorities that he was inspired by watching the Islamic State's videos on the phone.
The police also announced that he also requested the suspension of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that they were “obviously disappointed with the decision of prosecutors.
“We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and condemnation for life without the possibility of release will only extend trauma from those events for anyone concerned,” Patton said.
The Saipo's defense team has already asked the prosecutors not to demand death penalty.
According to Members of the Conservative Party, he should be entrusted with negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
In today's protest, Nigel Farage committed himself to mobilise the people's army at the Conservative Party Conference.\"
The United Kingdom’s former leader of independence declared that politicians must, by means of Euroskeptics, “as one of the own Members of Theresa May proposed, should be negotiating with the EU just him.
The Order Conservative Member Peter Bone declared when he marched in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be out\" if he was Secretary for Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May is facing in the reconciliation of their ranks, where there is a deep spread, has yet highlighted the conservatives fighting for the continuation in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexita in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers in the process of attacking the supporters of Brexit, the supporters of the Union and the EU itself.
The partners insist that they continue to seek to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences “and will force Euroskeptics and Labourists to choose between its package and the \"chaos\".
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave will gather in Solihull, where he wanted to go to Chequers.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
\"If he were in charge, we would already be out today,\" he said.
Member Wellingborough added: \"I will stand up for Brexit, but we must bail on Chequers.\"
To show resistance to the EU, he said, \"We have not fought the world's wars to listen.
In our own country we want to do our own laws.”
Mr Bone refused to propose that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: \"I think that the British citizens would change their mind and want to get in the way of the debate, it is absolutely common.\"
Conservative supporter Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: \"One day I say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
\"Chequers is unfamiliar with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and do not like him members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.\"
Forget Chequers and start listening.\"
In a sharp report on Mrs May, he says, \"Minist Presidents will keep their place when they keep their promises.\"
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians had to put themselves in an awkward situation” if they wanted to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
\"Now it's about trust between us \"people\" and our political class,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them we won't let you.\"
In the report of the enthusiast crowd he added: ,I want our political class to feel the pressure on the edge of the damage to Brexita.
,Now we mobilise the army of this country's people, which has secured us victory in the Brexity referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain who rules itself.”
In the meantime, the residents of the Union marched with Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had transparent Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend start of the operation of this party.
The Labour Member Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because of problems with the safety of the party's application after the opening of the conference.
, These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for the unproblemless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a frasce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren intends to think well about the candidate for president
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after November elections, “they will rethink the run-in for president”
Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at the City Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting to re-election November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the centre of speculation that Trump could stand up in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall from the moment Trump went to office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to address the President's office.
Warren said that it was time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, with a woman in the highest place.

Great Prize Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of master of the world when the team directed him to win Sebastian Vettel
The moment Valteri Bottas ended up in Saturday's qualifier before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the team director Mercedes will play a big role in the race.
From the field of the position, Bottas had a good start and almost Hamilton got rid of it when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettela to attack the team partner.
The vet went into the depo first and let Hamilton catch the wagons that were rolling on the Group's vagina, which should be critical.
The horse took the Mercedes to the depo about the wheel later and after the exit he went after Vettel. However, Hamilton went forward and in a tight due fight had to leave the Ferrari inadvertently left the inner track free so that he could defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen went out of the back row and at the end of the first round was on the day of his 21st birthday in the lead.
Then he led after a big part of the race because he kept his original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could lock Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he drove to the depo in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight wheels he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got a warrant, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and rewards are the first two places,\" said Hamilton.
That was a really bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday assembly because she insisted that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with the charge of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech to the Assembly in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Court of Justice, instead of saying that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad and disbelieving and lying--
“One thing that could happen, and a beautiful thing that happens the last days in the Senate, when you see that anger when you see those people angry and evil and disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the release and publication, and they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it--
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you get away?
Remember her answer... you published the document -- oh, yeah?
Oh, no.
It did not publish,
Well, wait a minute.
No, no, no, he added and imitated during the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information went missing at the beginning of September - but Feinstein refused to escape.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s screams, nor published any information on the case,” Klomis Feinstein said how he informed The Hill.
“She asked me to keep everything secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do.
However, it seems that she did not believe the President who expressed his views on the case at the meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a very bad speech of the body.
She may not have done it, but anyway, it's the worst speech of the body I've ever seen.
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court Judge whose three women accused of sexual harassment and suggested that the Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power back any means available.
You see that apostasy, this abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they must smite into the ground to get back to power and to the cormid, - quoted Mediaite’s words.

Air Niugini's plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after the crash of the aircraft in the lagoon one person is missing
A airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the micron islands in Pacific has now stated that one person is missing, while at the beginning it was indicated that all passengers and crews with a total of 47 persons were safely evacuated from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in the press release that on Saturday afternoon he was unable to find one passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in search of a lost man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for the provision of details on this passenger, its age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane fell into the water when attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials on Friday said a total of seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline claimed that six passengers remained in the treatment on Saturday and all were in a stable state.
However, what caused the crash and the accurate sequence of events remains unclear.
Air companies and the U.S. Navy have reported that the plane has arrived in the lagoon before the landing track.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was on the way.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane arrived from a very small height.
“That was so good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes further stated that along with others, he managed to get water on the deep-sea zone to the emergency exits of a diving plane.
He also stated that the onboard staff were panicking and yelling and that he himself suffered lighter head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors who worked near the port pier adjustments helped rescue using an inflatable boat that carried passengers to the shore before the plane sinked to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network states that in the last two decades, the aircraft crash has died with an PNG registration mark of 111 persons, but no accident occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its speech on Saturday in this case in which a man repeatedly was tried to burn a woman alive in the State of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Ministry has testified several hours in his analyst Paul Rowlett and provided expertise in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst sketched the script, using records from a mobile phone 29 defendant Quintona Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he received localization data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was dead at Chambers' night, which was contrary to his previous statement, said the Clarion Ledger.
When it was shown on mobile phone data that he spent the night with Chambers, he realized he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford was in court in court, and he testified that he had not been in the city in question.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was right that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that “the car was lying because my car was in Nashville that night”
Another accident was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks to the day she died.
However, mobile phone records show that these two only knew each other a week.
Rowlett said that the moment after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“ He wiped it out entirely from his life, ” Hale said.
The defence will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to come before the jury later that day.

Another black man?
The NY candidate is suing a couple for his “racistic” message
The New York applicant is suing a couple for her discriminatory discharge after she received the mistaken text message from the mother in which she was marked as “the other blackie - text message.
A couple refused to be racists, and he compared the action “exhibition, ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when her first day at work in 2016 found out that her children's new tutor Giselle Maurice was black.
“NEEEÉÉÉÉÉ, TO THE Czech Republic, ” wrote P. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the text report.
However, instead of sending her husband back to her, she sent her pi. Maurice.
When she understood her faux passport, so “a concerned woman, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, fired Mrs. Maurice and said that she had just left the challenger who was African-American, worked really badly and that Philippine had waited for her, said New York Post instead.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple about compensation for getting fired and requesting compensation of USD 350 per day of six months' engagement, for which she was hired at the beginning, even if without a contract.
“ I want to show them that they do not do this, ” said Post this Friday and added: “I know that this is discrimination.
However, the couple returned the punch with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they could no longer believe her after the offense.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not racist.
We are no racists,” said her husband, Joel Plasco, Post.
“But would you put your child in the hands of someone you used to behave rough, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco resembled an action for “exhibition, ” and claimed that his wife only cared for a two month old child and was in“ great difficult situation. ”
“ Would you take someone like that?
That's not a nice thing,\" said the investment banker.
Even though the court still insists, the jury on social media has very quickly condemned the couple for their conduct and logic.
The publishers of the stories about the Pidveton bear were afraid that the readers did not turn themselves in with a talking bear, show the latest reports.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after receiving the book, said: “It is difficult to feel in the situation of someone who reads this for the first time before publication.
But it is very fun to know now that we already know the tremendous success of the Pvedton bear -
She pointed out that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he got inspired to write children's books about a little ply bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added on the day of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a “sacredort, a period after his death last year.
Pvesterton, who describes as “the great member of her family, ” added that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quite quiet man, he was never boastable, ” she said.
“But since Piveton was such a real character for him, it was like you had a child who achieved something that you could truly be proud of.
I believe that on Pvetton's success he looked at this view.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to assign all the successes to only Pvesteron.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“He called me on a regular basis to tell me that this is really bad and he does not expect to get away with it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“I had a phone call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to tell her goodbye.
So I did.
I said, “Tash, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart in the hallway slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to just keep it together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from her daughter's loss, joined the plane together with other passengers without showing what a difficult test she's going through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
“ I held my head down, and my tears were running all along.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt a stunning understanding for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Dying women send postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and telephone numbers that people can search for support.
The son of Tyler Mrs. Davis was only 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and, as a result, he took his life in 18 years.
“I would not want any other parent to feel what I felt every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, who is 45 years old and living in Lydia, said her son was a gifted young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was able to light up every room -
However, before he died, he left work because he was “in a real dark place, ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at that time, found the undead body of his sibling after he married his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I constantly fear what it will affect his life. ”
Mrs Davis suggested a postcard, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and may speak to them even if they were friends.
Don't shut up - you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is the flying girlfriend of Mrs. Davies, has lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“ Nothing told me he felt down or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“For days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
The worst part was Christmas Day, when children opened gifts, neither looked at them, nor looked at them.
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma to them, but that she had to gradually get through it: “This thing can make a complete hole in her family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight--

Bretta Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as the FBI starts its investigation
“I thought that we could get something that he really asked for - an investigation at a time of restriction, with a limited scale - we could bring some unity into it,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the Committee would “fall” because both parties would be buried on the acquired positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The elections in the middle of the parliamentary period are only five weeks away from us, 6 November, and if the Republicans fail as expected, this will lead to their major weakening in the attempts to enforce the requested man for the post in the Supreme Court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbyed with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and his wife, Ashley, who was then a personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI builds up his report?
The Senate will vote on this and currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Yet it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break his tie and confirm at the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim “clothes, ”
The numbers of refugees from North to South Korea have decreased since the beginning of the government Kim Jong-Un seven years ago, according to the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoteing data from the South Korean Department for Unification, stated that 1127 escapes took place in the last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that more stringent border checks between North Korea and China are behind this and higher rates of smugglers at the borders.
Pchjongjang didn't make any public statements.
The great majority of refugees from North today get an offer in South Korea citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30 000 North Koreans crossed the border.
Most of them run through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in a heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China looks at refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South - which are technically still in war - has significantly improved in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met at Pyongjang to interviews aimed at stopping denucerating negotiations.
This took place in the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear arm of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the USA of no progress in sanctions.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we should unilaterally be armed,” said Mr. Ri in speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said it was inappropriate to serve the Supreme Court.
The leader of the democratic minority Nancy Pelosi called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that it was inappropriate for the service of the Supreme Court because of her temper.
Pelosi made this comment in Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t help but if any woman had ever introduced such a theatre, they would call it “hysterical”, said Pelosi in her response to Kavanaugh’s quarterly statement before the Senate Court Board.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both at a teenage age.
Kavanaugh was very emotional during his introductory words, sometimes he almost screamed and choked about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee and stated that their accusations against him were “the grave and coordinated attack, organised liberals who could not be transferred through the Hillary Clinton Proposed in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's statement proved that she was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was presumpted against Democrats.
“I think he has been disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he leaned on the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question whether she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will tell you this, if Congress is not telling you the truth, then it is not eligible not only for the work of the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is working on now,” stated Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Board of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democratic, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential income in the law on acceptable care or Roe vs. Wade because she was considered conservative.
As part of the hearing prior to his confirmation in the function of Kavanaugh, he did not reply to the question whether he would withdraw any decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ There is no time for a hysterical, presumptuous person to come to court and expect us only to say “Jeje, this is beautiful,” Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After words, months, and years of envy, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we have anger,” Mrs Stein told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, ” he said.
He continues: “A woman who was a director somewhere helped me, and who told me that she was crying too, but she created a certain technique. This means that when she had anger and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “You may think I was crying because I was sad.
But I have anger--
And so she continued.
And I think it's great--
The elephants are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my life's memories comes from the first job where I worked in an office where men were dominated. I once expressed my unexplained anger by crying. But older, always cool manager who I always feared a little bit, caught me behind the neck and dragged me into the stairs.
“ Never show them that you cry,” she told me.
“ They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad and will be pleased that they have given you -
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congressman from Colorado, cooperated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a non-marital affair aboard a Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidate.
“It was not a well thoughtful decision,” she said to me in laugh after 30 years.
\"There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “The Snow and the Seven Dwarfs, ”
Because at that time, the campaign has been running for a long time, it has been unable to keep up with the contributions and so it has committed not to go into the match if it does not get 2 million dollars on the contribution.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some supporters who would give USD 1000 to a male candidate would only give it USD 250.
“I think I’m going to get a discount, ” she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions - as an expression of gratitude to people who supported her, a frustration with a system that made her more difficult to raise money and focused on the voters rather than on delegates and anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocating with rage.
“You might think that I was nervous about how the press reacted to it,” said Mrs. Schroeder.
“And perhaps you would have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.

Why China-American Trade War for Beijing Can Be Good
The initial balance of trade war between the USA and China was deafening and although the battle is far from being fought, according to experts between being a market between countries in long-term terms beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the USA, provided the first warning this year with Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most important escalations, however, have seen the light of the world this week when new tariffs for goods for USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion) have been reported, which practically means taxation of half of the trade exports from China to the USA.
Beijing has always reacted, not least by imposing customs tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China tried to pay the US the same coins and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would be on its knees.
Although China would want Washington to return to its original tracks, it would mean to withdraw his requirements, but public subjecting to US requirements would be completely humiliating for Chinese President Si Jin-pching.
Even though experts think that if Beijing could play his cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The reality is that the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger economic outflows in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have already supported,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is prepared for voluntary return to refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country over seven years of war.
During the talks at the General Assembly of the UN, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual stated that the conditions in the country were improved.
\"The situation in today's territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in combating terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal state.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million inhabitants still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a deplored country.
He stressed, however, that we would not receive conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe has responded to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris

It was a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, really happy I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I am glad that I could help,\" said Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He gave his man John Ramp a cup, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I felt the unbelievable pride that I defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching the guy,” said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, which has won 14 greatest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team has been fighting all weekend trying to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have presented the top golf course throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the unsatisfactionable results of his team: “I am proud of those boys, truly fighting.
We actually warmed Europe this morning with our heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players actually played very well.
We will regroup and in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, we will move forward.
I love the 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to get out of here.
You've played us--

The red tide was also observed during the Pasco period.
Central concentrations were reported on the coast or at the free sea last week at Pinellas. In the Hillsborough period, low to high concentrations have been observed, lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, lowest to high concentrations near the coast or the free sea for the Sarasota period, lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, lowest to high concentrations on the coast or at the free sea for Lee and low concentrations in the Collier district.
