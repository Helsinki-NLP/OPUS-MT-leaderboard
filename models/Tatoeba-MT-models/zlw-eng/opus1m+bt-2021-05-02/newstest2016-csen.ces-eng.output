At an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend.
During the call to an emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police to shoot his girlfriend and it is necessary to come home to them.
Lamb assumed that his “sold dog” was a living house and probably upset, and that contact with the dead woman’s family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and hand written a message on the white office paper: \"I am so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one who ever loved me,\" said Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would ride 300 miles on a school campus where the police thought he shot a favorite professor named Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
The Lamb said he made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after shooting at the school, students and the faculty were forced to hide behind the locked door, the authorized authority continues to seek the motivation of Lamb’s motivation.
The details that were published by investigators on the side of the state and students and employees who knew him together created an image of talented but probably problem teacher.
The students confirmed they were looking forward to his lesson.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote to thank the “great people“ with whom he shared the academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with other 17 members of the Faculty and many students attended courses at both times.
At the same time, inclinations have occurred in terms of problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers said that he also seemed agitated and distracted, - as if something was wrong with him -
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb said he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for health-free reasons when he said he had some kind of problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
President William LaForge said he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “Mr. Lamba apparently suffered something”
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After he left the campus, the police caught his trail when he crossed the border of Arkansas back to Misisippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gun gun in the yard about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville in Mississippi, confirmed the Coroner of Washington State, Methhel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said that he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb started working at a university with 3,500 students in a city, which accounts for about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught countries and classes of education.
In spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of Lamba's long-time friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb's 20 when they met together.
She was with her friends at high school, and he was the great older kid who taught her how to play guitar for several years.
He was quite a matchmaker back then.
The heart of all the girls was scarred as soon as he appeared,” said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said: “I killed my wife, but there was never any record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house neighboring the Gauter River's shoulder.
The police said the dog was okay.
Former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O ́Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, which is now 19 years ago.
“She was completely dismayed,” said O ́Steen about her daughter.
She was with her mother the best friend.
O'Steen said that he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail studied at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and an occasional entertainment coordinator at The julep Room, will have a bright bar near Gauter, said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss in the night of September 5th, sweat what Lamb had done on guitar and harmonica for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything bad.
- It was just a happy couple, - he said.
We've been in trouble, and we've been recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, conducted a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy student club and student government.
At Delta State campus in Cleveland about Tuesday night, about 900 people, including the members of the Faculty, employees, students and members of the community, participated in reminders with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and his brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the Christmas Eve during which the University Corps has succeeded -Bright Morning Star - a-Amazing Grace -
On Wednesday she started school again.
“We try to get our students back,” says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagner Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife, there's no evidence that they were actually a sitter.
Toys R Us is planning to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the child toys and products manufacturer claim to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work out more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees at work in shops and distribution centres across the country, which is a decline compared to the 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will begin to recruit candidates this month, and the staff will receive them during October until December.
While holiday alone is months away, a shopping holiday season is coming and companies are preparing to receive staff temporarily to assist in shops and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his 'andde' with Princess Diana.
Prime Minister -Back to the future - was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theatre and waited for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that there would be Princess Diana,” he said in the trailer for the upcoming document, “Back up in time”
The movie begins and I realize that I'm in the reach of something that could be called a fake date with Princess Wales.
- Again in time, - is a document on “Returning to the Future,” which sets out interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecki and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Prime Minister -Back to the future - was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: ‘It is indeed the most undisputable travel document that has ever been filmed for me.
- Again in time - it will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
United Nations Chief says there's no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russian accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution - a conflict of almost five years of conflict and more weapons only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The United Nations Chief has once again called upon all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at the Wednesday press conference that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five Permanent Councils of the countries - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the border of the Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that division in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers had made this situation inseparable.
Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity that they have shown in reaching Iran's nuclear agreement in addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to mark him as a person who often changed opinions.
The rest of the hands above the raspberry, like the unfaithful joke.
And some people are preparing for an implosion.
But whatever the Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they can't do it (now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a double-digit number, and some people are seriously asking what it means to nominee the chances of this real estate magnate.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this is saying that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership led to the rise of Herman Cain, eventually neither one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could attack in general elections.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the economic conservative group Club for Growth realize Trump's will to endure and start spending their dollars on a stand to take him down.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that real estate magnate is not just a mere phase:
Trump's favor assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his run-in in mid June, it showed the vote of Monmouth University that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
Following the vote of Quinnipiac University last week, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trumpa.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either ‘exploitation’ or ‘satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of 10 said that they would be “grewed out of his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said that they would be more than 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest in the enthusiasm level?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters claim that they would have been unsettled, or “extended” if Jeb Bush was a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his rebellion and insulting, 52 percent of Republican voters are totally inclined to think that real estate has the right temper for the president, according to the Monday vote of the ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senator's Club of State of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country where 52 percent of Republican think he has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independent people say his temper is not in the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they put on their textbook hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
The question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from late July when four of the 10 were betting their money on Jeba Bush.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had no clearest crystal ball in the past.
This time last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the run-in against 28 percent for Mit Romney's event nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpov's support is difusionally distributed between more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always majority support.
He runs over Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marc Rubie at 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jebe Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader with 19 points wide in a hypothetical match against one.
The Dutch majority of Donald Trump's followers claim they've already made their views known.
The new CBS/NYT Tuesday survey shows that only half of Trump supporters claim that their opinion will not change anymore.
Clearly, a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent says they keep their back door open for a change between candidates.
Yet, Trump's current strongest opponent of his outsider college neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico as a signatory to his campaign, immigration continues to hold as the main and central subject of the conversation for 2016.
Some are afraid that Trump’s awakening will lead the key Hispanic voters from the Republican side and the damage to rebranding.
But according to the new Monday's survey of the public opinion of the ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans claim that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It appears that as long as the immigration theme remains in the light of the headlamps, Donald Trump will also remain.
The government's frustration reaches new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of their support from Republican voters, especially due to their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday's ABC/Post vote say they prefer political outsider than anyone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are unsatisfied, and 21 percent of the “specially angry”
The House supported a greater share of the coal state.
The Czech Republic will receive over 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies at first reading supported the government’s amendment to the upper law, which regulates the amount of the return on the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that they would receive additional money from both the Treasury and the municipalities' budgets.
The opposition MPs criticized the proposal that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as yet, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government amendment of the upper law, which, besides others, means that the State should receive more part of the return on the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The share of the State will increase to 67 percent, while the percentage of municipalities will fall from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The forecast also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals that the company will make.
The change in costs for mineral mining is expected to bring more CZK 427 million to the Treasury than in 2013.
The revenue of the municipalities' budgets is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received CZK 450 million from fees and a government budget of CZK 150 million.
From the mining of brown coal, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were made.
The amendment shall also be calculated by increasing the remuneration from the pre-financing area with the permitted yield to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments shall continue to belong to municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) said that foreign members would receive CZK 14 million every year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of the mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but the government will set it up by its rule.
The refund shall be recalculated as the sum of the quantities of cut-off spasm and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the Government, the possibility of a flexible reaction to the current economic situation is a reason for change, among other things.
However, Mr ODS Marek Benda warned that the government’s order of payment does not need to be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not in this case tax because the state is paying for a mineral that is a state property.
Fees receive only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the village's money and a quarter state.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
The part of the money that the State will choose on the costs of mining will be effectively weighted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide the Danish rescue service.
The Presidency criticized opposition Members, who claimed, in particular, that they would damage the alien affected mining and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostová) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as well as so far as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
“It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget,” said David Kadner, elected in the City Region.
Before rising unemployment on Mosteck, KSČM Hana Aulká warned.
Kadner and Auulka failed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The reasoning report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, since prices are more than 90 percent of the long-term contract.
Therefore, the main consumers as power plants or heat plants should not feel price increases.
“On the other hand, however, the fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for their efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would mainly mean reducing the number of employees,” the government admits.
However, the increase in employment charges is costly.
According to the rapporteur, Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on carbon limits before the approval of the law.
If coal has been cut by limits, then it will have an impact on the yields for the state and the municipality, it has highlighted.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The limits below the ČSA should be broken down for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy will lead Bohemia as one, the weather will affect the deployment.
All four Czech tennis shows up at Davis's cup bar in India on the board, and this time each one of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav returned to plan that, given difficult conditions, he will disengage the burden on the whole quartet.
There are hot and high humidity in Delhi, which is why they expect demanding matches that can stretch up to five hundred.
We need to take this into consideration.
I'd like to spread it according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, he returned during today's Czech selection training in the center of Radž Kumár Khanny.
With one team and the world's 40 George Vesels count into Friday and Sunday two games.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to be in the position of two.
I want everyone involved.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, Captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech presentation should be Štěpánkov’s participation in Saturday’s four-star.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to an experienced delinquent who has 18:4 in Davis' cup.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavláske.
“I really don’t know who and what it’s gonna look like,” he said.
It shall be decided according to development of two game.
The Varianta can be Pavlásek, with the Vesels surprised at the 1st round of the race in the debut of Australia.
“He is decent to the devil,” said Narr.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to demonstrate the same performance I've shown since the second hundred.
I would like to bring a point for this experience,\" said Pavlásek.
The house will be placed in the two-her Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ladder), which won the Challenger in Shanghai last week, where the player defeated the third and fourth hundred ladders.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both guys from the Challengers and ours have the ATP Tour experience, but we've convinced many times that the Davis Cup ladders don't decide.
“It decides the current form, the weather,” said Navrátil.
Friday's opening two-games begin at 6:30 SELČ and can be downloaded because of the weather.
According to the predictions, the rain is not under the roof and the jacket is not under the roof.
However, it may be played for artificial lighting.
It's already on fire, and it's got two thousand luxes, which is enough.
“It should be added to the lights,” said Narrback.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Quests
From her choice, Mr. Corbyna's debut in PMQ is very excited to expect
Jeremy Corbyn's new manager will have his debut at Prime Minister's Quests later, and will first be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he asked theatres and more facts -
He also said that he could skip several sessions that he left behind to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test to lead Mr Corby, which comes after his appointment to the shadow booth and his Tuesday speech to the TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to become silent during singing national anthem on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle for Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is the center of attention to several stories on the front page of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem has drawn attention to himself
Mr Corbyna said that he would “have stood in a respectable silence,” and that he would recognise the “hrdinship of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain“
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow booth, Owen Smith, announced that the BBC Two's Newsnight programme would recommend a national anthem to sing, regardless of its belief that the monarchy should be canceled.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, quoted differences in economics, defences and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that the political differences in the work also “staff”, after Mr Corbyn’s appointment through his position in the European Union and the government’s limit of benefits.
Mr Corby stated at the TUC conference that the Monetary Party had presented amended proposals to remove the entire idea of a dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party, very clearly, was defending government plans to reduce the limit from £26.000 to £23.000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Monetary Party facing David Cameron for the last decade of his election as the leader of conservatives.
The leader of the workers’ party, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas from the crowd - to questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both the \"post-back answers,\" and the engagement of the trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secrets, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate - such as when Mr. Cameron leaves abroad.
He also rejected the idea that he would have left other colleagues to step out for him from time to time, because he heard that he was still discussing the matter with the House of Snowman John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wanted to separate himself from the policy style of “Punch and Judy,” which was often linked to PMQ, but a few years later he admitted he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990 PMQ was seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their management of the House and their attitude between other MPs, although critics argued that they became a caricature and far-reaching reforms were needed.

The Libra rises while the growth of wages in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following dates and showed recovery of British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was conducted above by means of the SABMiller tender.
Between May and June, GB profits including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This has been the fastest since 2009, and it seems to be as though the estimates of when the rates would rise.
Sterling increased more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% higher than the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index concluded at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional share on the market and jumped by 20% after he received an approach to the offer from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine two of the world's largest breweries, and the approach of brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry event was 0.9% higher than the encouraging news from the Rival Group of Luxury Goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The shares in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using a shared position as part of the debt reduction strategy.

JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company reported 83% jump in the mid year in the meetings before taxes £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
The Executive President of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that the higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean the greater purchase force in the pockets of potential consumers.
But it's unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could interfere with JD Sports expansion plans, added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague apartment marsmeloun are going.
Controversal construction got a trace.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the abolition of the decision unlawfully and will appeal against it.
At the heart of Prague, 1, hundreds of people protested in front of the Prague office, a petice was created in close proximity to the Anezský monastery in Prague.
The Magistrate stated that there had been a breach of the construction law since all the appropriateities of the territorial decision have not been respected.
‘The transitional territorial decisions do not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, distance from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clear and understandablely described shape of the building, the definition of the territory concerned by the effect of the construction,’ it is written in its decision.
It also considers the fact that some documents for decisions were issued for the original dossier, which had changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be created on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor has no valid approval.
However, it follows from the record material that the owner only gave consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the location of the construction on his land, writes the construction order department.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta, the investor company of the construction order department did not take note of the decision of the supervisor - Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
“We have been preparing this project for 17 years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned,” said Razetto in the press report.
The project that people, because of the allegedly proposed colour of the fassads, call for strong emotions in Prague.
There were hundreds of people in the city centre in the past protesting against the construction.
The associations and residents of nearby houses hesitated that some of the permits were issued many years ago for a house that had looked different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of buildings for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Anezian monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original period of the 2008 project, which counted with a glassed fasad, refused, on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NDP), the Ministry of Culture and cancelled the authorisation of Prague memorials in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with facial shape windows but the NPÚ and the Magistrate Memorials were approved and construction permits were issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the exceptions of the opponents, said he never counted with the fassad in pink color that gave the project a nickname for various white sugars.
Czech politician brought migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian fugitives who were going to take about half a mile.
At that time, according to him, it was not punishable in Hungary, he claimed to the human newspaper.
We knew that law enforcement officers didn't get that kind of action.
But when the police stopped us, they arrested us for our surprise and transferred us to an investigation facility in Shegeda, described a letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
I hear the police have behaved properly, but they've got communication because they didn't have much English.
However, the prison thought it was triple.
For example, in our area of dimensions about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria suffered.
There was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl between them.
These people have been locked up in there the other day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, he told Berg.
What can't be entertained?

Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's assault in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are added with brands such as Dunsborough based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29th when the seller of food, alcohol and hardware celebrates its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because southern and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notorically guilty and IGA shops enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queenslad - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in eastern states.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will go to 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that took over the market from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose $ 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in southern Australia and 30 in the West during the following year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million on income before tax, confirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in markets in eastern states, especially Aldi and Coles, although the last survey of Roy Morgan found that the buyers in IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash's food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund manager Hamish Douglas, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunch in Melbourne could probably disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglas's commentary.
But it's known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share fell from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the earnings from Metcash food business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailes, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of speculation, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has transferred to counterflow and invest more than USD 150 million per year to match the market prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helps IGA retailers re-create shops by adding fast growing food and news from private customers.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the price comparison programmes and the acquisition of trades will be caught and he hopes that he will return largely back to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanas Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healym
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanas Kokkinakis has become a secondary loss in a recent habit around his friend Nick Kygiose and deserves praise rather than criticism, reports President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented dua often called “Secial Ks,” drew attention to himself thanks to the afre with the unfamiliar Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka on Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in passionate qualifier play in Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated from the referee, Harrison then declared: “Wawrinka had one to load Kyrggios and I was supposed to drag him too“
While he was last seen tearing the rocket after the hamster caught up with Richard Gasquet on the US Open, Kokkinakis was unfamiliarly defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a second two-star location behind Bernard Roma in Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
“I had an intense thought that in my opinion Thanas was a little involved in the whole dispute,” notes Healy.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost the hamster in the US, but he's not the first player who would be proud of himself because of his frustration on his own.
But he did really well because he was exposed to a very provocative circumstances in the US for Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard, and he goes through the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the closet, he's training hard, he's in an amazing condition, he's a very stable and advanced young boy, and I simply think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kygiose because of the important match starting on Friday, and states that “the negative decision” is the right solution for everyone, but supports the native from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term permanent.
“At first we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversial [Kyrgios] that was created around him,” says Healy.
And I think that Nick has raised very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out he's growing quickly in the public's eyes, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside of the public, when he can think about it, is the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders and stops migrants
Following the notification of Hungary's threat on Tuesday, it closed its southern border with Serbia and held those who tried to cross over it in order to stop the arrival of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants collapsed in the country of no one and Serbian authorities reacted to the rebels.
Those who are stuck with unknown times on the ground’s belts between two states stand for those who run from violence in their home countries to build tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When helicopters cross over them, migrants call together to open the border, and they place orderly unit of Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was “not acceptable” to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbland) He wants to be part of the solution, not just a indirect injury.
During the next days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries,” says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The concern for Hungarian-Serb border came on the day after the 28-country block came to Brussels with a single immigration policy.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an event agreement for another month or end of the year that the EU nations would receive more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European summit on Tuesday to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hope on Brussels or its neighbours.
The Tuesday situation of threats in two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to address the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and to speed up the judicial cases of asylum negotiations.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijarto said that his country is also planning to build fences from the barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News tutor Charlie D ́Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the cut wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who follow better lives and not war refugees seeking protection, which is a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force on midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of the 4 metre fence that the government has left to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish a longer period in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
“Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration of the Hungarian government, the Hungarian government has declared a threat,” said the reporters spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Sheged.
In this we have very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still needs to approve the deployment of the army that was waiting for next week, but ascensors Associated Press on the border have been watching heavily armed troops with cars and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, adviser to Orbana for domestic defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the territory of the state.
They penetrated the fence, and now they're accused in police custody of committing obstacles under new laws.
The authorities quickly let the fence be fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after the use of a warm car covered by a flat wire.
At the main border crossing with Ruszke, chaos was created because Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and created people's pressures.
About 20 came in, but thousands stayed out.
Another refugee group blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton jump before Bernie Sanders decreased by half in the national vote
The former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in a democratic national nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her head.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary voters (a 58 percent drop), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (a 17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, receives support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the launch of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim it is too soon to say that they are clearly a decision that the candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more certain of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton's soil was lost in several demographic groups, while Sanders got a few.
Clinton keeps a big head start between women and eases her leadership.
Her support between men has fallen significantly, and Sanders has only lost 5 points to her.
The advantage of Clinton and the democratic voters under 50 has been overtaken and now they're even with Sanders.
Clinton still has great leadership thanks to the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-check before Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points on her in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in all states say that she would be thrilled to support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
The quarter would support it with some reservations and the next 15 percent would support it only for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I guess it's not surprising that the current captors of Clinton are particularly intimidated for her.
The views are mixed between those currently not supported by Clinton - only about a quarter would strongly support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that they would strongly support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When the supporters of Clinton are asked on an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), it follows that it is time for the president to be a woman (13 percent) and that he is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton's beneficiaries also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, there is a large possibility of choosing and agreeing on problems.
While the vice president considers the potential candidate for the president, 57 percent of the democratic primary voters would want him to face it--the third thought he should not run again.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as second choice for the nomination of the party, Biden is the most common choice.
There were more than half of Biden’s supporters as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will spread from 20 points when Biden is running for 30 points without his candidacy.
Thirty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; but this number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far away from the second in this scale, but the percentage of people who see him most likely is increasing.
However, when a candidate's greater importance has been asked, democratic voters prefer solving problems against larger chances of election.
Like last month, neither one democratic candidate or potential candidate is acting as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among their primary voters.
Most of them see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and credible, and they think they have strong leadership quality.
Biden of all three leads to honesty while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters don't think Clinton's honorable and credible, i.e. twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent of him has no opinion.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are consistent with their ideology.
With regard to all these standards, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal e-mail and server as state secrets continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view did not influence her at all.
But between the American public, it's a different story overall.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public's views on this topic have been divided in March shortly after this problem came out.
Most Americans claim that this email repository has no influence on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton has worsened.
It is mainly the Republicans, where more than 6 of 10 argue their view of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton's perceived as honorable and credible among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem between registered voters overall: only 32 percent sees her as honorable and credible, which is a decline by eight points last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trumpa as honest and trusted.
But Clinton and Trump have good signs of leadership.
Out of six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were best served in honor.
Sanders sees more people as honest than unclean but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't think of him.
The score of the error in the sample 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump at the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest survey, and others are leaving support for them.
Volitors from the Republicans across the country continue to support Trumpa by a vigorous majority, and came from 23% of support in the last CBS survey carried out prior to the Fox News debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
He also found out that Carson is leading the coast across the demographic groups, and tells Trumpa between the university-renowned Republican voters.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor of the state of Ohio John Kasich, is behind the border with Governor Scott Walker, completely on the ochozu of 10% of the support fell to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The success of the 376 Republican voters sample in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson improved and achieved 19% of the support between the Republicans for Trump 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
On the rising Carson trend, Trump decided to shoot down the neurosurgeon in the service, and Carson even apologized for questioning about Trump's faith.
“We need energy,” explained Trump last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity have been accused of the death of a student in the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the requisition of the Brotherhood ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dog brutally attacked Chuna-Michaela, Denga during the opening of the ceremony in September 2013 and the delay took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, notified the police.
The police said that he had his eyes tied, had a bag full of sand of a total weight of £30, and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen fields.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches and then fell unconscious.
The members of Pi Delta Dog Brotherhood didn't call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and apparently waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, said the police.
However, they found time to change Dengo's dress, heat up his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the state president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Vagner at the press conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide equipment and essentially preferred the well - being of fraternity before Michael Denga’s life,” said Chief Wagner.
He failed to recover and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report Deng was repeatedly hit by a blunt object to the head, dead and thigh.
“A lot of families have been presented as a result of the abuse of brothers, and at least one student dies every year due to overcapacity since 1970,” writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengov's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The great jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty more than two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of assaulting the abuse and crime.
“We want to hold not only the persons involved, but in the event that there is an organisation that has approved it, either officially or informally, we will also support them with responsibility,” said Wagner at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned fraternity and national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This will happen when Fed raises interest rates
The tariff growth will come and the bull market will be rounding, the yields of bonds will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it takes.
For the economy, it specifically offers the history of a small factor on timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve in the increase in rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why the US central banks' officials stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when they start to increase their rates, but rather the trajectories, as long as normalisation takes.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members may make sure that all the habits due to an increase in speed can be exaggerated.
The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the 'low money' era,\" said Julian Jessop, Head of Global Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is the view of how certain areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last about a month, the expected increase in tariffs can make air a little constant.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“It appears that there is a trend for reinvention of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect delay in monetary policy,” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what would happen after the increase of Fed.
More specifically, the market for the past 35 years often most - about 14 percent - is going to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (mean increase 2.6 percent) and then return again to normal state after 500 days, with an average return from the last six cycles of 14,4 percent, according to recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main stock loss of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock has a tendency to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recess is a fact of economic life, but increases in rates often help her.
At present, Fed is facing some conditions that have not existed yet and which could succeed the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that a rough domestic product close to its lowest point in history when increasing Fed's rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 tariff increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal annual GDP increase below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect to maintain it when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, reports Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and could arise in the question, the report is different,” said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready to grow Fed all year long and all their eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee that took place this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategists and economics believe that FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading is only showing 25% probability.
In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles have been in the supercycle of the growth of the pak effect with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the starting recovery,” says the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far from the longest of Fed's waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're 74 months away and we're still going on.
The fixed yield was also callible because the market expects to increase tariffs and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares enjoy.
The main difference is that the impact is more likely to be seen in bonds than in shares when Fed changes the policy direction.
For bonds it appears that the revenues change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle, the bond yields fall immediately,” said Deutsche.
The Strategé Charles Schwaba believes that the increase in rates would result in an increase in income between long and short-term bonds being equal to the curve.
Debts with high yields often work better in this climate, even though we are still careful to drink the yield,” said Kathy Jones, a firm analysis of the fixed pension in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed's policy.
“The power of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations is a number of signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of more stringent monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is better, the credit margin has spread and the volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when Fed strengthens politics.
In general, companies implementing most of their business in the USA will win interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
A nationwide company with a lot of debts will get worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be larger.
“Historie shows that “quality” shares tend to be overcome within three months after the initial increase in rates,” said analysts Goldman Sachsve in the customer report.
The companies with strong balance sheet presupposed the weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields, as well as low volatility stocks, have also exceeded their sales of lower quality on average by 4 (percent points), respectively 3 (per cent points).
Deb will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates lose the most, said Goldman.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers also enjoy a growing dollar.
Experts can see their profits also through higher yields, but experts have different opinions about how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for-increasing -
He thinks he's becoming more unrecognizable than his commercial rival.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and says he's just cheating on the British.
Members' colleague Damien Collins attacked the voice and says he's not an original idea.
The BBC Radio 3 is changing - in Classic FM, claiming to be the leading Member and collecting fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove they're doing something they don't do.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC heads that the public service radio station appears to be ‘hazarded’ and is increasingly unfamiliar with its trade rival.
“Radio 3 seems to be - I do not like to use the word “inhaled” - but it seems that it is changing to Classic FM,” he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me when you actually just imitate what we already have in the market,” said Mr Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the reason that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rivalry in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classic music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn from any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and making music is actually at the top level.
\"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,\" he says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC controller Radiia 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element in the production of the BBC, which came under fire due to the footing of commercial competitors during the transmission of culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
You see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the show BBC1 - in which the September star Paloma Faith aBoy George as a judge - was produced by a typical method for the BBC -
He added that he wanted the Corporation to find a hit from its own stables when it started with a fun series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of more future series of The Voices or the spending of money to pay fees to other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have grown at a slow pace since August and can be Black Friday on wine
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since 2000 they started their own records.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for braking
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise, and it made many British main streets become a city of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online online sales, and new figures show a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth from the start of the year 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of establishment of online sales, and new figures show a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the level of growth in the past years and go back to 2000, you have always rationalized the situation in time,” says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, IMRG Market Index Editor.
It explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to carry out purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on couches.
But now he's a little staggnosed, and that's why he seems to be losing it.
The Black Friday Fenomén, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from buying before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average buyers turned on their computers to arrange purchases and to throw down several websites of vendors.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, thanks to which the buyers make their contracts again, can hold customers from other purchases
Research published by British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was lost online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of sales are carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the crane fall in Mecca and the family Bin Ladada was punished
The bodies of 29 were transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly throws blame for the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group design magnate.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury 29 victims of a crane fall in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed up to a certain degree in white, mourning chose the way and gave respect to the sacrifice when the first of the fallen got on their last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message came past the holy place, where only a few days earlier, the construction crane pierced the ceiling of the Mosque and turned to the believers.
The body was released for the funeral and the Saudi king sanctions the building group of bin Laden's families over the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual snake bond.
Saudi officials have already promised that the snake to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the shoulder of the crane upstairs when he was not in service.
The Arab version of the decree, carried out by the State by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of falling.
The English news agency did not report this detail, but said that it was prohibited for the directors of the company to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims covert before the pilgrimage of Hadz later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement of the crane collapse and had not been made available to its representatives for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of non-use of the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Hundreds of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort at the head of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling families for decades and run large construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader Usama bin Ladin was the son of a garbageman whose family died in the '90s.
The crash became in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a bond that at least once must be attended by every fine Muslim in life.
Officials say 158 people are still staying in the hospital.
Officials have determined that there will be one million riyals (€ 174.000) dedicated to relatives who were killed, and the same amount for permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.

They say that the British are decommissioning hammers and puppies and handing them over to the workers of the Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a painter's puppy, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out Cuban work at their home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronica Laura, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of East Europe's trained traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laura says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight of the ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
Currently, most men's men's sex workers are.
She said that there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that depict more women's households, which are doing more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs Laura says: “Stables in our business work mostly men.
We need to move closer to balance.
In fact, half our customers are women who make 80% of their decisions on goods purchases.
Women play a great role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laura, who is one of only five women at the company's managerial cormila according to the British FTSE100 index, also re-structed her top team to reflect the equivalence between the director of men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including executive and financial directors.
Ms Laura says: ‘It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important subject here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced a fall in both profit and sales after the group took the cost of closing the trades.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
“It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice,” said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
President of ODS Zbynek Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution was good, but it would be better for the long term to be in standard validation, because it would be reflected in the next years.
“We have space to find the mechanism we will arrange,” said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michael Marks (ČSSD), according to which it was expected to be framed over the framework of the law next year.
Marks argued that it would improve the social situation of pensioners that she did not think is pink.
The increase in valorization next year would mean the budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion and the ministers debate every stamilinon.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right hand that it reduced the pace of valorization in the past.
Report Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
In this right of payment, in December, it greatly complicated and possibly it was aggravated, he said.
The President of the ČSSD Roman Sklenák therefore proposed shortening the time limit for discussion of the standards in the Committee for ten or 20 days, even blocked the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
Bonus should be a total of $1.73 billion.
The money is intended mainly to come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should increase on average by about a barn.
The contribution should be made by pension amendment to people who will be entitled to pension or part of the pension in December.
Even those who have disappeared in December could receive it before the payment of the pension.
However, they would have to make a written request by the end of next year at the latest.
The revenue in the Czech Republic is regularly reflected in January, with regard to price growth and third growth of real wages.
This year's pension is 41.5 percent gross wage, it should be 40.5 percent next year.
Last year, the State spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions, which was about five billion year-on-year more.
The expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all the expenditure required by the law.
The average full retirement pension last year increased according to data in the State Final Account by 104 to CZK 10.714.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a payment of 2.4 million full of old-age pensions and about 17,000 ratio pensions.
Jaunin has left his political career plans, and he's going to be engaged in science.
The senate chair had a billionaire according to the Russian media, almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the western Californiagrad region, whose governor Nikolaj Cukanov as the candidate of the Government of the Single Russia to defend his post in Sunday elections with an overview of his defence.
According to the Russian laws, senators do not call on citizens, but they are chosen by the governor from three candidates whose names are announced before the governor's election.
After the election, the senator will choose from three candidates.
The complication was the fact that in the Kaliningrad region 20 years did not live as required by the law.
Although Kremlin has found an exception to the fact that he is an exceptional and authorised ambassador who does not apply to the legal requirement of a long term stay.
Czech comedy theory tiger ended.
The last drop in the presiding of the main hero is the voluntary death of his mother-in-law, whose power and patience are out.
Grandma - Iva Janžur decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
John is clear that she is with her wife Olgou - Eliška Balzer on a similar path.
He remembers once having his own will and dreams, he wants to live well and freely again.
They want to get the government back over their lives - and as a solution they choose escape from the past, he said to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted a comedy form to capture a type of relationship that one of his partners does not feel completely free.
He said it was clear from the beginning that Bartošk's main role would take place, with whom he had already worked on the series of the Infidels.
Yet, an actor who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with reconvalescence after a serious illness surprised him.
We agreed three years ago.
I gave him a script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised to see he's probably a athlete.
He used to ask where he'd sit before shooting another scene.
He was riding his bike this time, climbing rocks, even walking down the hill.
And that's all in record tropical heats, and the director tipped it off.
According to Bartoki, women are taking tigers to make a rabbit out of him in time.
They're gonna put some food on him, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't happen to think of playing the tiger outside of the rabbit.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, commenting on the actor.
His wife, who can act slightly negatively on the audience, made Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, intelligent, empathic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a suffocator, and she wants to seal her husband to death, undermined Bajgar.
The film parallels also the fate of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavel Beret - and the son of Erika and Pepiek - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film manufacturer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, koroducenty Česká TV and Radio and TV in Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google’s American Internet Society has promised to provide more than $5,5 million ($136,6 million) to organisations that help thousands of refugees arriving in Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday, Google.org, which is a charity reproduction of this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Teličk's part of the visit for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the movement of the ANO Pavel Telička has set aside a planned Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijan authorities have cancelled the official part of the visit today.
According to Telička, this is justified by the EP resolution last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička was co-author.
By decision of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Telička lost the opportunity to talk to the official partners and also to visit political prisoners who depend on the consent of the authorities, explained his Brussels office in the press statement.
The journey planned several months in advance, Telička wanted to use the text sent to the Czech Republic to meet Parliament's leadership and ex-excute representatives as well as the representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The EP resolution condemns the unexpected repression against civil society in Azerbaijan -
He invited European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, shareholders and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment of Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Chadjiu Ismail, which was committed to uncovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it will build its airport base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not rule out the Russian Air Base in Syria in the future.
We don't have such plans so far.
But nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has already had a flying maritime base in Syria at Tartus port, which has been used by now as a service and logistics centre.
According to the Russian press reports, Russian weapons and military material have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, arms shipments resulting from valid business agreements are involved.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to set up an air base near Latakija, which, for the time being, remains the fairy tale of the Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington has nothing to do with the particular military intentions of Russia in Syria, which match American commentators.
The U.S. Foreign Minister John Kerry talked about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with a Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov, it was their third telephone interview in the last 10 days.
Next week, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyjah will go to Moscow to interpret concern over gathering the Russian arena near Israel.
The speaker of Josh Earnest's White House marked Assad's support from Moscow as a lost bet.
Russia’s policy objectives in Syria have said that they are rather unclear.
The Moscow according to him made Syria a satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin has been following a long-term goal, but what it is not clear about Earsta.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation of Russian press, is to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas says that the Russian leader is not speaking at all.
According to today's report on The New York Times, the American government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and Russian president could meet during the UN meeting.
The ideas between the White House advisers, but they say they're divorcing so far.
The TASS agency today appealing to the words of the Kremeli spokesperson Dmitry Peskova wrote that Putin has not yet met with Obama on the program of her New York stay.
Put the sesame oil on a yellow diet, help the hemp to strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When biting off seeds, the cold will remain in the oil of all the healthy substances.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, such as glanders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for preventing cardiovascular diseases.
These are the most common reasons for the death of the Czech Republic according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics for several years.
Yellow inflammation suffers mainly from women, helps sesame oil.
If you are one of Asian cuisine lovers, you must not miss sesame oil in your sleeping room, which is part of an original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can be used in the heat treatment of food and has a number of favourable health effects.
It is often used on a yellow diet.
The essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the formation of gallbladder stones.
These are 90% cause of gland inflammations and women with these difficulties three times more often than men.
In general, the problem with the gallbladder is particularly affecting people who don't transport and consume a lot of animal fats.
The sesame oil can be used with success even on a liver diet which is very similar to that gland.
If people want to take advantage of all health benefits that bring about the consumption of this oil, they should be careful of goods from exotic food stores.
Asian producers often use overfishing seeds that have a more pronounced taste.
But oil will lose all the active substances, described by Ladislav Wycecky, the executive director from the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces bio virgin oils, pressed for cold.
The company is newly produced with sesame oil and uses exclusively unbleached white sesame seeds.
In an hour, he can lick eight kilos of sesame.
The mechanical pressing of the raw material shall be warmed up to 40 degrees, and therefore the product complies with the criteria for designation extra virgin.
There would be a loss of nutrition at higher temperatures.
Sunflower oil sleeps in heart diseases and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oil is sunflower.
According to Jarmila Hamer's research, which led to Masaryk University, it appeared that he preferred it in a warm kitchen of 43% of respondents.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, at 180 °C it is starting to burn.
It is better to use it for example for the taste of salads and is especially appropriate in the diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids are most reducing cholesterol levels.
In heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of total fat and calories taken.
For example, there are 62 calories in one sunflower spoon, 99 calories in a spoon of rape oil.
As far as food energy values are concerned, it is important to realise that there are more appropriate natural foods with nutrients than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to touch extra virgin oils.
The Sunflower will last just like sesame and hemp nine months.
Storage in the fridge is further extended.
Old oil is particularly known by bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no cloud on the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Crude oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical hemp are classified as so-called superfood, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the most healthy of vegetable oils.
For this marking, the highest content of omega 3 and the omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids are grateful.
These essential fatty acids can't make the body itself and man has to take them out of food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
Studies of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
The men in France and Greece conjure it with 0,6 grams, on the contrary, the Icelandics take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
It is appropriate to include the fuel oil in the diet as part of a supportive diet for strengthening immunity and healing of the injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of the cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using hemp oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that in Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
It'll be sold 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon in the morning.
Konopný oil is not tasteful, but greatly strengthens immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kryslický company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, they're America's most generous people.
There's 1.4 grilles on one house.
Then all the world’s various barbecue competitions are held, which are confirmed by the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives were not affected.
The absolute majority then grilles even several times a year.
To make grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - ideal to adjust the meat by sorting several hours before heat adjustment.
Which oil is best for this and while grilling it leaves healthy beneficial substances?
Generally, the grilling process itself should be covered with fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oil starts at high temperatures to lose its taste.
Healthy extra virgin oils then lose also the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain in the consumption of oil from foods that are treated at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oil during barbecues will not be able to use it.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, the Czech Oil Expert from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately release the grape oil.
It is wonderful to add the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen there is a unique feature of raising the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and barbecue because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Thus, even at this high temperature, as one of the few oils retains the health of the beneficial substances, describes the benefits of the grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating the excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increase metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidney.
We also help to increase our external beauty - for it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps care for dry and soft hair.
The chefs commend the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
Thus, it is possible to use two methods when grilling and grilling itself.
By cooking meat and fish, we'll keep their food.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of marinades: oil, acidity and spices.
We add acid to apple vinegar, for example, and we feel the softness of meat.
The root adds the taste and oil to preserve and adds the right river, advises Daniel Wolf.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is directly ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils, it can pass through dark meat.
So, Marined meat or fish are prepared for barbecue, how to continue?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by just a few drops to prepare food.
Same thing for barbecues.
Some oils are for this method of preparation complete taboo.
This is particularly relevant in the case of oleaginous, hemp oil, which should not be warmed up at all.
Before grilling yourself, shake the grill with oil, you will prevent burning food.
The preparation of the Annexes is also an essential part of the barbecue.
There is practically anything suitable for grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, cooked bread, light vegetables salad and many more.
The chefs of Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the salad of the Hot Summer.
To it you need: - 1 pcs of peaches - 1 volume of rukols - 1 cup of covered cucumbers - 1 cup of mixture of salad leaves - 3 soup spoons of grape oil
Add to salad bowls add to a mixture of salad leaves wrapped with raccoon, broken cucumbers and big cubes covered with peaches.
According to the taste of salt and spray, you can also taste the milky chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, pick up a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste then you can eat salad with finely cut almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it does not matter only to the drugs, but also to the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapaut, ergotherapy, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about treatment, such as women with multiple sclerosis, they also need consultations if they decide to have a child, social advice, advice on housing, etc.
However, all of this is not enough: the development of disease may significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he fights the disease actively, the longer he can work and does not necessarily change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, parasites release the area for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been demonstrated that the regular movement is considerably delayed when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not be subject to various myths, for example that the disease automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.
Therefore, the site was created Take a chance (www.bemmit.cz) which is supported by the ongoing media campaign take a chance.
The most important person in care of multiple sclerosis is neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the doctor may have an effect on the condition that the disease begins to heal earlier.
It's because we have multiple sclerosis medication in an inflammatory stages where neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we reach, the greater the hope that we will manage to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurology clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple rehabilitation care that most often solves the weakening of lower limbs or balance disorder.
Patients are working according to their individual needs: to maintain condition, to improve walking, to strengthen the bottom, to reduce swallow failure or to improve coordination.
“It’s really individual, depends on the specific problems of the patient,” says MUDr. Martin Kövári, Mayor of Klinika’s rehabilitation and body medicine Faculty of Hospital in Motole.
Although people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same illness, it is expressed in a slightly different way in everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always ease its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that sick people check what they do, and that strengthens their confidence.
During the exercise, endorfins are also flowing out, and man feels good after him,” warns PhDr. Kamila Risa from Klinika rehabilitation medicine Faculty of Krářské Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we operate on the lymph system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psychological and immune processes and stabilize the disease, supplying it.
“We now know that they need a targeted burden,” says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, prefers Clinics of rehabilitation and body medicine of the Faculty of Medicine in Motole.
The objective of physical therapy is that a person can remain as self-permanent as long as possible, including a working classification.
Physiotherapy is therefore working with ergotapets to give each individual a compensation aid to cover him for peace.
Many patients need psychological care or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When you have a serious illness in your life, most people will shake it.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
He must respond to a great burden - a loss of health.
With such a painy soul, we're supposed to follow someone, not try to take everything on our own beds.
“I work with them so as to finally conclude that even with hisdicapp a full life can be lived and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life,” says the psychotherapist Renata Malin - Schubert from the Neurology Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Air production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't make and process.
Still, it can be connected to super accurate, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for the formation of composites, bump into something as common as meroon furnaces.
In a drum that resembles a pot for a sugar wool, the edges of the sheet parts that just came out of the milling machine are passed out in a pile of furnaces.
“Now no one has come to anything better,” Ivan Dubský, Director-General of the Air Doors manufacturer Latecoere Česká republika, smiles.
At the premises in Prague Letňanech, the former Letov produced a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, they deliver doors for the Brazilian embraer 170.
Doors, whose part is compiled in Prague, also take passengers to the first and higher class on top decks of the largest airbus A380 transport aircraft.
There's also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The accuracy here is the main motto.
Maybe the moment keys let the company sort twice a year.
If there was no inspection on the yellow sticker, they should be able to explain to the auditors of Airbus or Boeing on a regular basis whether the doors were produced according to agreed rules.
Human senses, but advanced techniques have not replaced completely yet.
One door to A320 is 1500 years old.
You've got to double-circuit your opponents.
It takes them two days.
And according to the sound of a hammer they'll know if it's already broken properly.
The tolerance in which they are moving is minimal.
It may be above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0,13 mm.
That's about twice the thickness of the human hair.
He'll come up on a series of trained beats.
When the controller gets his finger through a series of rites, he'll know if there's any off tolerance.
When he takes the exact slope into his hand.
The aircraft was live by the L-39 training aircraft program before 1989.
But there was no more production in 1991.
The company had to quickly find new contracts.
At that time, it combined with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
It won a selection procedure for the supplier of emergency doors for model A321.
They weren't so happy talking to Boeing.
“We were a small company that didn’t have enough money for investment and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supplies,” recalls Dubsky.
The doors to the US producers would remain incarcerated if Letov did not participate in the Prague conference of the international airline company of the French group Latecoere in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French, says Dubsky.
A year later, Latecoere bought a Czech company and with a strong company came new contracts.
The installation of parts of the door for A320 opened immediately in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck door came for A380.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing facility for deliveries to Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latécoer, we would not have been able to get to these great orders ourselves.
Maybe we could do work or small parts.
Partners want a delivery guarantee for 20 or thirty years, explains Dubsky.
Last year, Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification 170 special manufacturing processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't make any doors to the aircraft.
Get certificates that the production processes meet customer requirements and keep them in repeated controls according to Dubské million crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and more stringent.
We need to train employees, set up facilities and re-register the whole process, supply Dubsky.
Now the company will complete the preparation of the process for metaling zinc and nickel that will replace the present for human health harmful cadmium.
Although the award was received from the manufacturer, technology had to be adapted to equipment or chemicals used in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we show them the production.
They'll check our lab.
One set of samples will test themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, approximates the way the customers control them.
Long-term exclusive contracts are different from Prague companies.
The Prague plant is now standing and the production of embraers falls.
It produces half of the total volume of the door for A320.
Replace the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for the Brazilian or European producer.
It does not mean, however, that he could say any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It shows how many doors will stand after ten, fifty, with the pieces made.
The price per piece still decreases to a certain limit value.
We have to fit in this price formula.
If we don't, we're gonna lose, he says Dubsky.
Half the halls, where the electric cabinets are composed for Airbus A400 M military aircraft, are now empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
There is a new semi-producer line built behind the wall and a door assembly for the upgraded model A320 Neo.
Being fast and precise.
‘This is a trend that takes place in aviation,’ said Dubsky.
The distance has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that Airbus has yet ordered 3278 pieces of the new model A320.
Just a few meters next door, a line will be created for the complete mounting of the door for the upper deck of A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, says Dubsky.
Before that, however, the company must pass the qualification tests, for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices at the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
“For the company it is a huge credit when it can process compositions in addition to metal materials,” says Dubsky.
But in the Czech Republic, Latecoere gets to the edge of production capacity.
There's no more room in Letov.
Before the entrance of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's got 800 of them, and there could be more than one hundred of them in three years.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new planes order airliners every year, they don't have to worry about working.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money for a September loan payment.
Finally, Latecoe was able to deal with the major creditors.
At the end of August, part of the loan replaced them as shares.
The creditors gained a share of EUR 57.4 million in the company.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, i.e. 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has signed new shares for EUR 222.9 million between the existing shareholders.
In total, it raised capital by EUR 280 million.
Thus, the whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, representing 85 percent of the sales.
The average increase in contracts expects four percent per year until 2017.
In the contract book, he has orders for EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to a four-year-old production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on hoods.
The Czech race in Prague Letňanech is important for groups.
The group's sales accounted for 16 percent.
According to the number of employees, she's the largest foreign branch of the group.
The Members have supported a greater share of the state from the coal charges.
The change in costs for mineral mining is expected to bring more CZK 427 million to the Treasury than in 2013.
The revenue of the municipalities' budgets is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received CZK 450 million from fees and a government budget of CZK 150 million.
From the mining of brown coal, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were made.
The amendment shall also be calculated by increasing the remuneration from the pre-financing area with the permitted yield per thousand crown per hectare per year.
The income from these payments shall continue to belong to municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) said that foreign members would receive CZK 14 million every year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of the mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but the government will set it up by its rule.
The refund shall be recalculated as the sum of the quantities of cut-off spasm and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the Government, the possibility of a flexible reaction to the current economic situation is a reason for change, among other things.
However, Mr ODS Marek Benda warned that the government’s order of payment does not need to be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not in this case tax because the state is paying for a mineral that is a state property.
Fees receive only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the village's money and a quarter state.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
The part of the money that the State will choose on the costs of mining will be effectively weighted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide the Danish rescue service.
Today they criticized opposition Members who claimed, in particular, that they would damage the alien affected mining and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostová) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as well as so far as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
“It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget,” said David Kadner, elected in the City Region.
Before rising unemployment on Mosteck, KSČM Hana Aulká warned.
Kadner and Auulka failed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The reasoning report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, since prices are more than 90 percent of the long-term contract.
Therefore, the main consumers as power plants or heat plants should not feel price increases.
“On the other hand, however, the fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for their efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would mainly mean reducing the number of employees,” the government admits.
However, the increase in employment charges is costly.
According to the rapporteur, Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on carbon limits before the approval of the law.
If coal has been cut by limits, then it will have an impact on the yields for the state and the municipality, it has highlighted.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The limits below the ČSA should be broken down for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time for decisions on interest rates for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching American Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time after almost a decade.
The survey of 80 economists called Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for a while and leave interest rates between 0,0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been sitting down from the moment Fed reduced the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of zero lines and initiate a process of normalising interest rates,” says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economy.
The US economy has managed quite well, there has been recovery in the form of adding triliones to the state account and creating only low inflation levels.
However, Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared to increase, but the circumstances show that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEČ.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a message saying that he was “loved, first murder, and that he wanted to take it back, discovered government authorities on Tuesday.
The police at Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a teacher of the country and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police Monday morning around 10:00 a.m.
and said he shot someone.
Lamb dispatcher asked him to send the police to his house.
He said: “I shot my wife last night, and he also mentioned that there is a “a dark dog ” in the house that “will not bother anyone, but will be upset.
The police requested the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't show up.
Lamb didn't explain why the house was fired.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41 years old Amy Prentiss and a hand written message from Lamba, saying: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person she ever loved me--
After leaving a message, Lamb went on 300 miles long journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teachers and then took his own life.
Dean of William LaForge's university said that he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's head--
Despite the Monday statement that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship between Amy Prentiss and Schmidt’s government authorities, they stated that there were no “minister evidence” about “the mere triangle,”
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said that she was “a great person. ”
There was a divorce 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19 - year - old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was the whole case of “hewed -
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends, ”
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, was working Prentiss from the house over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, went with Lamb for about three years.
“ She always wanted to help others,” she said.
Police said that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said that “he will not go to prison, ”
When the cops got him on the highway near Greenville later on the same night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to the CV published on the school website, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
The stars that have lost their magic
The actor (left) has several stressful years to take a picture with his son Redmond.
In 2001 he fought with leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
I'm sure all of these things choose their own tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months out of the game for double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right legs during the defeat of Manchester United in Lize Masters against PSV Eindoven.
While this left this left-to-face injury in tears and thrown it out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused the unobserved procedure of Hector Moren in 15 minutes when the 20-year-old Shaw entered the PSF area.
Nine minutes was treated on the field and an oxygen mask was also required before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: ‘He suffered a double leg fracture and now he is in the hospital’
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe after tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years it's got very hard, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
He also had an oxygen mask when he was in his closet.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group stage.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalt kick.
Nicola Rizzoli's referee didn't punish Mexican.
Van Gal suggested that the Italian referee was mistaken.
You can check for yourself whether it was a penalty fee and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure for both legs.
The Tweet from Shaw's account says: “Thank you all for their messages, saying that I cannot express myself destroyed, my path to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger.”

The English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of a European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, Coach PSV, said: “It was a very ugly injury,
When any player leaves the field with this injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never our players' goal to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a fractured leg during the fight for Mexico against Van Gaalov Holland at the 2014 World Championship.
“It’s very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear of the severity of such an injury, it is not good,” said Coc.
I wasn't able to look at this moment.
All I saw was the ball that was headed in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the procedure for Luke.
In an interview for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how he feels, I know how difficult that may be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
The PSV Andrés Guardado player was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling's cover.
I'm sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
This thing knows every parent: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long to learn almost the memory of her.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
At the request of the providers of children's schemes to appoint a popular children's book, he selected the Prime Minister Lorax, a story from Dr. Seusse from 1971.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in the report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: “Integrated, touching, creative, and with strong content, I was happy to read to my children, because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had never seen before.”
All right, except that in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of the book by lift from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
“In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree,” is a brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss whose real name was Theodo Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it was not suspicious itself, the text added by Cameron reads as a summary lift of film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database page, and starts with the words: “In the city of Thneed-Ville covered walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes he will get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey -
Because he was open to a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the history of the book, where the latter young man learns that the local nature is devastationous to the count, trees waving the industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a humble, humble creature who speaks for trees -
Most likely such a relatively small PR task was given an assistant who never read Lorax a child 20 times in a piece.
The Downing Street spokesperson said the text probably came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron's employee provided the text, but no further comments.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but he's still holding
Competeing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think the repetition of the defeat of 3-0, which she suffered last time in the trial series, will not be very likely.
I wouldn't be able to rule out a guest's win either.
Alastair Cook's side can be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good gamers in this burning team and also collective thinking is strong; they do not bear scars from 2012, only youth positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell out of England's team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a tough nut for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but hard reality is that the players of the kriret are taken on the basis of performance.
For example, around Joe Root's name, there were no questioners, which led to a announcement, because, and I already mentioned this earlier, the players are their best suitors.
A few more half years, and Lyth could've extended his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
Chief coach of England, Trevor Baylis, praised his attitude, although his performances were not quite 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time he gets the bat to show himself is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven jaws, just like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton gained nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could do is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean - although Lyth was in the best form - but this wasted opportunity is the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and that's the bat I'm valued very positive.
He's a x-factored kriket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 against us at the Trent Bridge field, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will obviously depend on the overall set in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts at the side of Cook, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was brought up and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why a strikecaker can't fire, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing kriket player.
Moeen may not do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but there was a number 3 for them and there was no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 trials before his 2001 performance.
He immediately made three centuries of cooking, and he didn't even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the chance to watch him, he took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics - on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and I see it as a pram, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectives decided for youth.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
Apart from the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their coach staff.
Names of Mahel Jayawardenea, Srí Lanka's bat, as consultant for trial matches, can be a master move.
He's one of the most beautiful playing guys who'll bring extensive experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the tour white-ball and brings power to the team, and a clumsy spark.
I've always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahel, he has an intellectual mind that can be used.
New voices in the wardrobe, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been spoken earlier, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's partner Ben Stokes got one-day leave as well as Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even if many don't agree on it, the trainers and the selectives don't make a timetable.
And you must remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision must never be taken lightly.
Kampan Brexit could win if the economy begins to stagate by 2017.
The ingenious strategy of the reunification of David Cameron for the maintenance of Britain in the EU comes to other problems with every last day and without choosing a brilliant Jeremy--Is it Yes or No, Corbyn to the head of the Monetary Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe will dive in different crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have already had enough British self-centered agendas, dividing concessions and disturbing changes in contracts that they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting at Brighton, TEC decided they didn't want it even if they had made social protection worse.
We can even call it a Dave and George selfie.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, make a picture before the famous local monument, with or without local rankors, and then return home with words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who does not want to look into Britain in Europe - “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin - suggests that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don’t care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German cautiously balanced Chancellor, is an ally, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before becoming bad to her, as it was for too long-standing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French Francois Hollande is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist rule on the right side, Spain on the left.
It's hard to watch them break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving UK - which is something they don't want, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan on deliberately useless comments of the SNP style during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to succeed the process of Brexit, says a friend.
“Rehearsal negotiations have solved the problem - and “Brithing has nothing valuable about negotiating -
Europeans to their own injury know how expensive Fleet Street can be and how sceptical to the EU are the press oligarch baran because they were not inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in ratio 2:1.
They may motherly remember the name Boris Johnson, the ecclesiastical Euro-portunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur - the EU Street banana - at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his inquisition, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of non-payments of taxes, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo-free departments owned by most large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you were in the cage with a gorilla, you must throw bananas on her so that she wouldn't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he enacted Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of a cancelled EU Constitution, which was sunk by the French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received him a fireout card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who was friendly to me on Monday at Westminster - I told him that I can't waste any more time on me - it seems to be in danger of taking back the strategy of the boycott of Murdoch Neil Kinnight, which was probably now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marre, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'm going to say it nice, it's developing.
It claims that it would want to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people out of the persecutive tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englandism can certainly come to it.
That's what Hilary said -Bemom said, but not Benniite - Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner Scout couldn't agree to admit that Corbyn's appointment of Abrahamic McDonnella was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought for his loyalty on TV without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain, beyond all circumstances - Benin's phrase - apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and Members to meet them on Monday night,
Whatever background is the background of any sensitive image which Corbyn wants to communicate - don't forget, he touched me - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of the television broadcast and especially in faith, the party of paranoia and the betrayals of which social media are.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to accept the support of the Contracting Parties in the referendum campaign as himself as said by McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbyn's basic ecclesiastes about EU membership - in line with their Bennite, which surrounds the economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is central to the essence of dogmatism.
Like his evicting about Nato - Tom Watson, he believes that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand the sense of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States are already quite disappointed with the British - weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday launch of something called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise an electronic review published by Public Health England
The declaration by the Government of a financed agency that there are 95 % more electronic cigarettes than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have connections with the tobacco industry, reports researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet criticism of evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE published a report last month and described it as a ‘complex review of evidence’
However, several researchers questioned the extent of data and pointed out links between certain experts and tobacco industry.
The opening in the specialist magazine Lancet last month attacked the ‘micronishly chat base’ on which PHE founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts who were writing for BMJ questioned the claim that was allegedly “founded on rock or sand“
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: ‘The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness’
They claim that the public could expect the PHE’s claims to be the ‘current best estimate’ is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking, based on detailed examination of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to develop analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) decision of the model to synthesize their views on damage associated with different products containing Nicotin; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell stated that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwis Health whose director-general reportedly previously acquired funds from British American Tobaco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, states.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting admitted funding from an electronic cigarette producer but not financing which was allegedly obtained earlier from Philip Morris International tobacco company, they deliver.
The reason for selecting the panel members is not available but includes several famous electronic cigarettes champions, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some other present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by tobacco management.
The report in this group - excuses - missing - hard evidence of the harmfulness of most of the products on most criteria, - said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE’s claims that, in the meantime, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking animals, - were premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said that the BMJ claims had already been answered earlier.
He said: ‘Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking,
One of the two lifelong chickens will die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks presented by electronic cigarettes are small compared, but we must continue to examine long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows, and also what they do not display, especially when there were so many public confusion regarding relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die of smoking-related diseases every year and smoking costs NHS £2 billion per year.
By clear emphasising current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they have only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnds, claiming former Director Channel 4
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnds and The Voices, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would, by their right hand, be a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not formed by other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for setting up public service programs, which will probably be watching only a few people in complex broadcast times compared to his rivals, the largest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried to communicate successfully with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
“I fear with the idea that the BBC is issuing and sending programmes that would certainly be sent out by rivals without State contributions,” said Johnson in the Committee on Communication at the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain licensing fees that I am not sure that they are a good idea in the medium or long term, production should be reduced at least in relation to programmes that are not produced or sold otherwise.
They send The Voice in the main transmission time because they want to get as wide as possible support to the future.
The idea that no one else would send him out is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, it's ridiculous.
Johnson said: \"I don't understand why a regression tax should support programmes that can be financed without any contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnds further, and of course produced on home soil.
To be honest, other channels would have given them their right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC that he felt guilty about making ratings - because of ambitions for people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support.
His comment on the most popular show BBC repeats those which former Sky Executive Director Tony Ball used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC will sell the show as EastEnds.
Johnson said that even more moving public service programmes of the BBC are going to the BBC4, where it is quite often impossible to measure the audience, but they fulfil their powers and may argue when they are going to justify their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn income from licensing fees, - but of course we are doing all these obscene programs that no one is looking at -
They're sending them in time for no one to look at them.
As regards the license fee, Johnson said to the Commission: “I call on you to find a more aggressive system about who gets the best value of it.
Obviously, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I'd wonder if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC so much.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who came up before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its British mission in the sense of “information, education and entertainment“
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now classified as educational - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should be taken as a model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and changed to “information, clarify and entertain” -
On the subject of the Elstein partnership, he said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast only a handful on TV, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
‘Sonogenetics - or brain cells control using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the patrols are moving.
Scientists raised worms with genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small watch changes direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are unheard for the human ear.
The pulses work so that they convert the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called Sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activate itself outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from Salk Institute in La Jolla, California said for a journal Guardian that this method could replace deep brain stimulation one day - invasive procedure in which the patient's brain is prepared electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fluids usually don't react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would occur when they placed them in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, bubbles increase ultrasound waves that then pass through the body of worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves occur in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
Due to the sound waves, these channels are opening and activated by cells that are connected with, they are reported in the Nature Communications magazine report.
In order to control the patrol using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels of TRP-4.
Then when he used an ultrasound to be modified like this, sound waves were strengthened by microbublins and transferred to worms where modified motor neurons were turned on.
A new method is similar in many forms to optogenetics, pioneering tools that enable scientists to turn on and turn off neurals using light.
But Chalasani let hear that sonogenetics might have a lot of advantages compared to this technology.
Unlike the light that has to be sent with an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that when using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can feel on human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” said Chalasani.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your threshold!

Take a look at the video about the defense market from Amnesty International.
A terrible killer drone!

The happy voice and the caricature of metaphor leave no one in doubt that this advertising on the world's largest arms fairies is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International due to the emphasis on the willingness of the British Government to sell weapons through defense and security regimes of the International Veselice in ExCeL Centre in the London district of Doclands.

Eight golden rules for life on student railways
11 years ago, I moved to college as an unseen 19th-year-old boy, still believer in bars and moral relativism, but now I remember the tight smiles of those I was waving - and numerous, long-lasting complaints on the other.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Tracking on the track can move from slightly on the nerve going up to totally shocking.
It is appealing: to tell people where you come from, if you took a year's break, what your opinion on Corbyn and why - you don't really love Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from the HAHAHA, I'll be in my room.
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask yourself and express interest.
It runs the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and those you don't even have fun with even if your eyelashes were in one fire, and they'd be throwing out fire extinguishers.
Leave people space.
People’s rooms often change to drinking receptions, film evenings and municipal public places, but they’re also rooms where people dress up and arrange underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverti will come to college just a little bit.
Your room should be a refuge, yet many lines turn into an inseparable walking culture, which is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, “I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so that I can return to the energy that I used to talk to you.”
Try to know when a fellow is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One boy in my dorm had a habit that if the doors weren't locked, he's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to the seal.
Because you began to go to the university to the top of a caretaker, knocking on a foreign door, and the performance with a canvas sealed cake seems to be slightly less strange, less than “Welcome to the neighborhood, I've made you laugh, now smile while I ask you personal questions”
To offer domestic flavors is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe it will all end by assigning your face to a pleasant surprise.
That is, of course, the object of being a delicate baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and fat probably interferes with the fact that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Food theft is a common crime on the student railways.
Of course, stealing the whole chicken is a crime, but is there a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
double check with the owner of the milk.
There's a chance the milk will offer you even if they're running inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who's changed her milk for washing dishes to punish thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noises that disrupt people from sleep or college.
It's not just to be a delicate human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my corridor asked her neighbors if they could just shut up the drum and bass because they were 3 at night and had a piece of paper in the morning.
Their answer was to enhance music.
When they finally shut down at 5:00 a.m., she left them to sleep for two hours and then released her own music out loud, locked the door and left on her three-hour file.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future friend was on the same track as you?
And, on the contrary, it wouldn't be awkward if you got mixed up with your future friend, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would take control of your mutual friends too?
Of course, you won't guarantee your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future friend, at least try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
At a encouraging moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their locked room, there's only a thin line between legal and bullying.
Good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and give them the keys to the bottle with the water you put in the freezer - but never blind them their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to twins despite a uncertain prospect to the future.
Eva's had a terrible moment when she was pregnant with today's 7 - year - old Vitka.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone for preparing and raising her offspring.
With the current situation, I compared quite quickly - I was very excited about the baby and I was looking for a positive.
The most important thing and the fact that I'm alone with my child, I tried not to suffer.
And I certainly had hope that we wouldn't stay alone for a long time, remembers Eve's first pregnancy today.
She had already met on the Internet at the Old Vaš chat, with whom they started to talk about popular films.
Your Uncle Eve and Vitka even brought home from the birthplace, but he didn't play too much for his stepdad.
“For some time, he fell off the program,” Eva described in documentary series Four in that 3.
The third series of Czech TV series is currently looking for happiness at second attempt.
She also managed her family financial security thanks to her work on part-time work and her mom's great help and help her aunts.
Even the prospects for responsibility for a foreign child have finally failed to show Vaška's affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vit's second birthday, and now he understands Vaš as his dad, and he also calls him that.
Although yours already has two grown daughters, paternity in his 60s is enjoying his words, and he is also more devoted to children.
In addition to the Kingdom, the two-year-old Leontínka and the twins came to them.
“The vacuum in our family was somehow natural, perhaps by the fact that my mother has never spoken very much to me,” she thinks she is smiling Eva.
Any places?
At least we're close.
Ema and Ela were born in the emperor’s cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of gallbladder acids, which are found in excess of the amount in the blood and manifest themselves in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous to an unborn child who is at risk of premature birth and death in mothers after birth usually disappears spontaneously.
Ema and Ela were born healthy even when they were only 36 weeks old to Eva and Vaška.
Emek placed in the incubator at the intermedial department, where Vashva also works as a niece who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and soon after I was transferred from JIP to my room, she described a difficult period after Eva was given birth.
She spent twenty days in her midwife until the physicians agreed to release the baby, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for children to be taken in Eva's birthplace, but it didn't.
“I was a crazy steak for my husband and children,” remembers the hard times in the department of six and four times a mother.
She considered with her husband and signing the reverse, including because of an insensitive approach of one of the physicians.
However, this did not happen in the end and the doctors released Eve and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancy and births send ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45 p.m.
A large number of families can take care of each other.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to stand with an electrical two-plothing and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but the Pancek made Eve happy putting the gas heater in order to prepare food for six more comfortable persons.
If it's not hard, we'll be shooting at a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are particularly aware of the family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or the faintness of the house.
For now, we've been doing a lot better than we've been expecting.
Although the mess gets worse in a small space, and we walk out of here sometimes, but at least we're all close, smiling Eva, who can find a positive page on every situation.
The work of the lighter in the film is not a guarantee of regular intake.
That's why sometimes they go to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 ’ s, according to his words, care for family finances and for children physically manages how long will it be?
\"I realize that given our age difference, I will be the one who will feed this family,\" admits Eve to a plane when asking for the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly current to the employer.
And if she's the worst, my husband and I can dress up about a cab, he's joking a nice blonde.
Apple has a jo-jo effect.
The display's behind everything.
More powerful processor, camera with greater resolution, tighter sass or display which recognizes the strength of touch, these are short of the recently introduced iPhonies of the ninth generation.
The last two have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Applu was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight slightly increased compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram mass difference in the failure of the news was indeed negligible.
However, this is far from true in the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhon 6 and 6 Plus, the mass grew up in a smaller model of 14 grams, with more than 20 grams.
On the one hand, last year's affair of bending in Apple's pockets was a lot of trouble.
The gray paper is thus made of more durable aluminium alloy 7000, which also reflected on the mass.
But they have a much bigger impact on her displays.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the newspaper, thanks to which displayes recognize the strength of touch.
To this end, the display had to provide additional layers of capacity sensors.
The weight of the new iPhon display thus increased more than twice compared to the previous generation.
In the smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in the case of larger then 19 to 40 grams.
In iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved in this news due to the defatting cortex that has touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the most difficult battery element is the battery element, but its weight has not changed compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen in the display.
Weight 5.5 - iPhone 6s Plus so reaches 192 grams.
In any case, the new display technology will be practical when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday 25th September when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Are the wolves breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists made a finding that opens interesting options.
They discovered traces of a modern man's settlement from various times, including wall paintings, remains of tools and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which according to the tools dated up to about 30 thousand years ago, scientists discovered something that closely resembles the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In place, there were traces of oatmeal grains, which apparently passed through the process of production of such popular flakes today.
With it, the grain will first be wet, then dry, rid of the packaging, the so-called regiment, then it will burn and spill.
In the cave of Paglicci, it was possible to discover the grain which was, apparently warmed or burned, and then probably crushed between two millstones - at least this shows traces of use on two stones in the cave.
So scientists couldn't say in their publication for the PNAS magazine that it would be a complete process of production of flakes in the cave, but similarity is truly very impressive.
We also have no evidence of how the wolves could eat, but the idea that it was with some fluid and maybe even hot enough, of course, it is offered completely logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting document of how intensive people used cereals long before the production of agriculture.
If the Italian interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have passed by about 20,000 years of agriculture.
New reports of the station in the Transport Podnik Town Brno.
So once again, I listened to the report of the names of the stops in the trollebus: Pistachio, Tracing, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolebus was somewhat louder, so the report by the male voice was slightly less understandable than before the stops were announced by a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in deeper noise of traffic, it is better recognized than a deeper male voice.
DPMB argued that this publisher had chosen the passengers themselves - I don't know who asked me, but they certainly chose this from the studio recordings taken in total silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the bus engine frame.
I've been living in Brno for a few decades, so the correct names of all these stops I know of confusion, so I don't need this report, but strangers who don't know and for which these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and may be confused at the end where they accidentally arrived, then say that the stop to which they were supposed to go has not been reported.
Maybe the choice of voicemails - but better again voicemails - to do it again, and this time colored by normal traffic noise and engine rachot, in which the speaker is almost lost on the bus.
So that we don't have to keep listening to the names of the water station Heršpice, Sírova, or then the submersible in the closet that I went to in Komárov.
I assume my old man's hearing didn't suddenly get so bad during the one day when the voicer changed.
Before that day, I understood quite well the reports.
Good morning, comrade Chief.
It's from the tracker's records.
Today, few know what the greatest government and the smartest were the so-called complex audits.
I let myself remember.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatcher's office at the moment the radio sounded like it was seven hours ago.
“You are lucky that you did not get hit by the comrade chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that he is not in the mood,” noted the dispatcher, while I was writing into the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going through the precincts on the revision of minor mechanics.
It's not gonna work, it's a check-up today.
They're all fucked up. They're all terrible.
What's this about anyway?
- Well, you'll see, - the dispatcher has been smothered.
Next time you'll be there.
I ran out in the hallway.
Then the front office door opened and the chief appeared.
Hot, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling uniform.
\"Good morning, Chief,\" I said hi with respect, and I quickly turned on two buttons of jacket.
“Good morning,” she answered, and I quickly went to the second floor without realizing the cold, evil tone the old one answered.
“You're playing,” welcomed me by an engineer Eva, the oldest lady I've appreciated very much.
They said she was even chief before the comrades sat down.
They're checks, and you're gonna get there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they're once in three years, they all have to, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
They say I'll see.
I pulled out of the fucking fascicle with the periodic reports and the phone.
“Here Holcman, come to me,” said the chief of the voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and I've been quiet, but no one has answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
“Good day, comrade Chief, I came to your order,” I checked, barely entered the front office.
The chief sat behind the writing table and looked through some leystro.
“The other Mechanizer,” said after a while, without raising his head, and kept looking carefully at it, “I don’t like your behavior at all.”
He threw out the leystro on the table, burned himself in the chair's back, and he looked at me with a normal, unpleasant, evil, pyremous look.
I did.
What's going on?
Yesterday, he praised that in those few months, I worked very well in my office and that he was satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the readings on the distance.
Now this?
You realize that you're a track distance technique, and that's what you have to act like.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I've been in love with the fact that I've used such a greeting since I was a kid, that I've been so raised and that I don't see anything wrong with him.
It was like a red rag for turkey on the front.
“You are on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is an honor to work,” says the desperate chief.
Plus, you're still wrong about the superiors.
One day you will say, \"Panise, and the second time, the second time, the second time,
But I am no chief to you, but the comrade chief.
The governors are the governors, the chief liners are the comrades of the main line!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... comrade Chief, but... but I have greeted you with a common civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor to work or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
“It’s not your priority that you’re not on the side,” the student presented the chief who, in the meantime, calmed down a little.
But there's gonna be talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have an early retirement chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the others.
For a while, he was waking me up with a cold, penthouse look, and I was looking for the words I would answer.
I'm also upset with his promoted tugging.
He was just a few years older, and he was playing a gauntlet, actually a soprabobah.
A pedigree, self-adhesive, arrogant, how it happened to him right now.
We've all fucked him.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, president of the party organization to him as every party, but also to the non-straitians, he did.
But the chief said many, especially those with whom he could use his superiorship.
Right now, he shot me for all the crap.
I thought of something about my ass and it cost me a lot of effort not to shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn't go back to the squeezer anymore, let me keep doing the irritable official.
What would I use two kids for?
And a broken house!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
“This is all you can go,” concluded the audience chief and began to carefully review the leystro that he had previously had in his hand.
I was called in at 12:30.
Everyone in the office was there, asking questions about what and how, they said it would be good.
Only Ježin did a bit of talk about how it used to be his habit that they couldn't throw us all out, because he would have to make the comrade chief himself with his loyal ones, and that he wouldn't threaten us.
The word “fellowship,” he pointed out, as if he knew what the old man had shot me for this morning.
It was a nice neighborhood in the front office.
Comrade Chief at his desk and another judge at the long advisory table who should have decided on my shop or not.
Kádrovák, President of ROH, employee recorder, referee for special purposes, something on the way he counters to the military, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the track.
A regular track worker, patterned a pig or a fork to throw a brush.
But also a former brat.
It was heard that there was no fun with him at the time, he said it was a nice beast.
Bad languages said that school went out in seventh grade, nothing learned, he didn't know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up in a hurry.
But, comrade, yes, comrade was destined!
The chief instructed me to sit down.
There was a little soul in my neck, an unscrupulous neck.
Kádrovák read the civil committee's opinion from his place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, I'm two kids and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I've thought about it, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a judgment from the street organisation of the party.
He's been copying the civil committee's judgment, perhaps he's both written by the same person.
But then it came!
The long-term members of the party refused to attend before the commission and subsequently stepped out of the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The Chief looked at me hard.
Kádrovák noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief said he was supposed to go on.
It was worse than that.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was acquired as a party candidate.
No matter what the parents who came out of this country, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I also had a wedding except for the National Committee.
I failed the confidence of the party the worst way.
That's why I've been cut out of her candidates.
But that's not enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I made a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
In all this, I express my negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the Cladler reads, only the taping of the pencil into the board of the table interrupted the tight silence.
Everyone was careful about me, and I wished that I would be far away somewhere.
So I kept repeating myself in my spirit, “Commons - Overhumans, communists - superhumans - what have I got into?
Why didn't I just stay with the tailors?
I could've fixed the shifts without some kind of fucking checks.
But now?
The D.A.'s career took her for it before she started.
Go back to read?
I don't think that's gonna work, but I'm sure my chief's gonna be out for an hour.
“The other way you checked the comrade discussed here,” he interrupted the tightness of the chief’s question on the road.
Well, according to the judgment of the previous job.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, it wasn't too much.
He's nervously mutilated in the creases of sweat, like he's being tested himself.
He took a quick jump and gave some paper to the chief.
“No,” said the chief with a sign of grievousity, but which was often the foretellation of storms.
At first sight praise, taught with honour, studied industrial, worked as a locker in the task wage, full of 100 percent on average.
But it's a major meeting.
From where you took the judgment, comrade, he turned again to a coffeemaker who felt that it was starting to turn against him and that he might not have been a glitch very soon.
This is where the comrade gave it to me when he arrived.
Is that enough for you?
- Well, when he came to us, he went to the precinct to read, - he bled the bucket.
And there's no request, he was a little extra, so I put him in the file.
So, when you are included in the technical function, this paper line was sufficient for you, the drought was represented by the chief.
He was nervously mortified and had nothing to answer.
“We will discuss this later,” concluded the matter of the chief, and apparently, the cadaver is relieved.
For now, he's fixed it.
So what about you, comrade, is the chief turned again to me.
He's suddenly telling me, so it's over!
In my eyes, I was covered with heat.
He followed the regrettable and accusations, and I knew that I was the most supportive creature in the world that did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by undercuting the incomplete judgment, I misled the comrade's leadership, and I didn't understand why the judgment was incomplete when I got it from the cadaver in the factory.
I am also an antisocial worker who, at the time of building a real socialism, supports the lives of religious darkness, ba, even taking part in them.
That there was a lot I'd done, or maybe I'd still commit, and I'd pray for it to be over.
I don't care about everything.
I didn't care if I got out of the mechanism room.
I didn't care if I could get the crusher.
That's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
\"That's enough, comrade Chief,\" said the President of the Party, and he strongly interrupted the leader's left.
This comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he made!
But he's already given his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close his door to the side at a time!
To open up again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is once again worthy of our trust.
An unborn brat spoke as a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he so cunning or papsing the phrase from partay training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us too!
The chance to prove that he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not just you, comrade chief?
It is your duty to this young man, truth, a somewhat confused comrade, to support his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty no one's gonna get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty to all of us too.
This comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother not only punishes, but also loves.
When the President finished, no one even looked.
No one expected such a change of situation.
At least I am.
\"I totally agree with you, comrade President,\" said the Chief of Director, \"in an effort to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that I was headed for that conclusion.
All of them were boldly excited by their heads, but it was seen that they didn't believe him with a word.
“So I was confirmed for the function of a separate reference to care for basic resources,” I hid when I returned to the office and cried back.
Except for Eva's engineers, they were all at lunch.
The milk was listening to my inseparable fresh experiences and I was calming down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked if I could have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she built water on the boiling machine and had a cup caught.
In the meantime, she talked about track practice.
Like one judgment, often full of praise, they put a man in hand, and the other, in which dirt is found, they send to a new employer.
But I didn't end where I had it, but on the squeezer, and they didn't know where to send it.
And our bucket?
He's just taking care of where he'd eat or drink, and he finally figured out what happened.
- That one from the old one was caught, - it was misguided.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him, he's a lot of pressure.
And the party president?
Pretty much worse chief, no humane.
The Nula from the crotch having great power.
The coffee water began to warm and the office filled with the smell of salt coffee.
I put sugar cubes in the cup and the milk mixed a hot potion.
I hope I'm from the worst out there.
Now they won't fire me and the next checks are up to three years.
Anyway, the comrade chief won't forget that day.
It was published in the EPIKA's Institute of Technology.
The symbol of the village lived.
A round of windmills over Chlum are turning again after years.
You can see it's far away because it's located 15 meters high.
People from a wide area call it “the windwind on Chlum“
For the municipality, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal mark which the municipality gained for the occasion of the arrival of the natives in 2010.
“We asked for a sign and a fan at that time, of course, we wanted to have a sign, knowing it in the area,” said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It's kind of a memention now: it reminds us of the time when people here fought for good drinking water.
The one in Chlum last centuries was rare.
Until 1910, the Georgian representatives decided to address it, which then met until the mid - 1980 ’ s.
In the village of the branch of Chechov, they had to wipe out seven meters of deep well.
Three years later, the well was filled with metal structures with wind pumps, which pumped the water into the reserve room at the highest point of the village, near the church here.
“The company Antonín Kunc from Hranc at Morava costs CZK 2,400,” states the memorial inscription on the ground floor covering the construction of the barn.
After several repairs and wind wheels fell, the Czech Republic served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, the new chapter of water struggle began to be written: that day in Chlum began to serve a new water supply.
The wind pump has remained only a non-functional general symbol and a new rarity here.
The Dominant was brought up this year's family reunion.
Up until 2008, the Chlumští decided that the wind bike would reopen and bring again into the corridor.
They had to make a replica of the original wheel smaller on average by half a metre.
The wheel was set on a barn, but the same year it had to be lifted down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist the wind.
After that, the Chlum Dominant rested for several years under the roof.
Since this June, however, the bike on the high table is turning again.
On the occasion of a family reunion, the village had the replica of the wheels adjusted and replanted it at the top of the railway tower.
But the bike only draws useful water from the well into the fallen blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty.
“In autumn, the wind wheel shafts from the pump in the suction basket will be reconnected,” explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the wind bike has come into the general sign, but the only village of this kind in the whole Vysočina.
Similar element in the mark is in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chlovkovice and Green Hora in Vyškovsk, in Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerovsk or in the Police in Vsetínsk.
I don't know anything bad, but the Lafatu, she admitted to Opora Tripoli Goian.
“I remember my goal very well against Slavia, as well as all of my career,” said Goian at the presale press conference.
We were trained by George Hagi at that time, and it was bad luck we lost.
I hope I'm going to score Sparta now too.
Just the difference that we won't lose this time,” Goian continued.
This man who played 60 Romanian representations is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, says the Greek duel of Spartan Hybš.
And part of the ink that can wait for him on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Romanian Astro with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, and that's why he also went to Sparta, said Goian.
Another football player of the Prague club didn't name, so there came a direct question whether he knows David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of Czech leagues and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and had a easy look at Czech journalists.
The helpless expression in his face meant: ‘Why do you ask me?’
After a while, he triggered silence.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teamwork.
He's got a really good player.
And Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
They know very well about Goian.
“My experience from bigger clubs can be said to hold the defense of the Asteras, it is their organizer of the game,” pointed out the Spartan assistant Stanislav Heykal.
Goian's already had the best years in his life, but he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both the United and City Manchester units, but also headed for the Italian Palerma, played for Glass Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European Cups, pere wins in Czech league.
For me, he's a favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start a team with a good result.
Like Sparta, we're going to try to win, he said Goian.
I am in peace with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very looking forward to the competition from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague stock exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of the company's trading in Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken for the time being within the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on social events, says Daniel Buryš, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
In connection with the movement of the shareholders' registered office, the location of the shares at the Prague Stock Exchange is considered.
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company will complete the prospectus of securities which will submit at the nearest time the Czech National Bank for approval.
The transfer of holding and the related transfer of shares will be made in the form of non-public transactions, with only existing shareholders being involved.
Thus, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors under this operation.
If the company and its shareholders decide, later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016, the company stated.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or sales of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the shares in Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of objectivity of Czech TV in informing about the migration crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting of major Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time, broadcast the main news coverage of Czech TV.
How'd she get up?
When they are at the Faculty of Journalistics, they can learn about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's Czech TV Events.
The Migrant crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute when the Czech Republic informed about the concerns of Serbia's Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police called them euphemistically there was patience - throwing stones and attacking metal poles), now the current pro-migrating propaganda - check out the names of individual reports.
Critics of NGOs - a large area for non-profit organisations that criticise poor treatment with migrants.
Syrian children in Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugee not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Putting fugitives - ČT consistently uses expressions of runner or escape and not migrants.
The most surprising is that the CT uses only consistently and only images on small children and women in illustrations.
At the same time, she said that 80% of the men from migrants held in the Czech Republic were involved in the same broadcast.
Summary: From a large part of propaganda, which does not resemble communist agility.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
I soon stopped being the only resident.
I've got fishes moving in on the satchel toilet.
Domestic fishes, insects with imperfect change, i.e., not producing that crop from the flowerhouse to the bug and the young looks like an adult individual, just a tiny one and gradually grow.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't eat them.
First hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore for their liquidation provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cycle B.
Or something else?
However, they were successfully destroyed.
Later, I talked to the pharaohs the same way.
A box with some Juvenicalian who had brought the ants into the nest, and then he did not allow the Queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went, it became an insect subject to my admiration and more and more and more I was inclined to think that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from my life that interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace others.
I wouldn't be able to get a lot worse with the chins and the puppy's karma.
In the new housing, we agreed with our partner that if we don't find the fishes behind our necks, let them eat loose skins in peace, some of those invisible algae and everything like that.
Their peaceful existence, after time, broke the spider.
It was a common kind of a cop who had long-term sat on the ceiling.
We thought he was living out of occasional flies and mosquitoes, which just made us feel comfortable.
Because he's been with us for several years, we've discovered that he's been living mainly on fishes and that his number seems to have been holding on a small number of times.
Trustable regular contact with every need we have found out it's a female.
For we saw a romantic talk with a partner about about a third smaller, as carefully as it will be used on the thread of the spiders, so that it would not be eaten before it could reach an excavation.
It took about three days not to move and react to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love toys were played, we found the remains of the dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't even move for weeks.
When we thought she had it behind her, we were surprised by a lot of little spiders hanging around her.
They're gone soon.
The mines were eaten with a mother, and they broke up their work elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she left somewhere else or fell asleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little bit smaller, probably the daughter of the bathroom publisher.
For a while from the ceiling, he was careful to observe our behavior and move under the toilet bowl has assessed our non-vention as friendship.
The number of fishes has decreased again and the spider looked at his normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter reached the age of the night when the use of the night was already a shame.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've already had eternal healing of its content.
We encouraged her to use the toilet even more strongly.
However, the daughter found an excuse in that spider that she had seen very well when she was running away.
Our talk about the spiders seeing, the luck in the house didn't even take.
By crying and screaming, she forced her bedtime.
It wasn't too much.
There was a moment when a spider, in the interest of her daughter's development shift, had to rule.
It's left on me.
He was caught in a glass and banished through a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I used to hang out with him like a friend, but I still felt awful about being married for so long, like I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would begin to appear more often and start to multiply by geometric series.
The world wonders, the week, the two of us, there's no one there.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if that spider was there after antagonist's pattern, he didn't even pretend that the toilet environment wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of middle size appeared, and they came back together.
I had to figure out another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their bond to the spider had to have a reason to believe that if they didn't see him hiding somewhere else and that they were at risk of danger from anywhere else.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his quick disappearance in them caused some kind of alarm reaction.
More like I don't make any illusions about their eyes.
Some light of the placehost showed, but they would respond to hand wailing or rapid movements, no.
My daughter's been going to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she forgot about the nightbook.
All we have to do is attract another spider.
I'm sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they haven't shut up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the B-marker.
Desatro's statements of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
Humans will probably never stop fascinating in the past century.
He was able to dive so deep that the explosion was always a stunning finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the conscience of people, he entered primarily his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in his giant relationship.
It can also not be forgotten by its clarification of photofect or the idea of quantating the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the self-destruction system and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory are so mistaken for many, that it prefers easy proportions for closer knowledge.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he hadn't found this brilliantly simplified form of explanation: An hour near your dear seems a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems like an hour - and that's a relativity.
I have chosen to choose from his whole circle of famous quotations these tens that have literally captured me.
Smart people try to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of temptation can ever prove I was right.
But the only time he can prove I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break the atom than to destroy prejudice.
If there's a mess on the table with a reflection of the mess in mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight for in World War III, but in the fourth, it's gonna be rocks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to raise it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes in his study, 15 minutes with his analysis and 5 minutes by his solution.
In the world, the hardest thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue for teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlínský Region are waiting for a change for 1.5 billion.
“It’s a success when we consider that all four of them remain in black numbers all year long,” he said with satisfaction the flockman Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the regional equipment is at this point about CZK 32 million.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In addition, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiští and Zlín, the construction of which will amount to nearly CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period when we bought mainly equipment, it ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top health care cannot be done, justified the country's plans for health care Lubomír Nečas.
There are changes in all hospitals.
The construction staff are coming to the hospital next year.
In Vsetín, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now choosing nearly 300 million crowns.
In addition, they have a scheduled port of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new internal for about 200 million this year to the open central pavilion.
And the Zlínska Basť Hospital awaits a long-term construction of a new central income and an internal hospital for which three quarters of billion will need.
In all cases, it is a major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
“For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step,” said Věra Prousková, for example, the director of Věra Prousková.
The five-storey building there is to be completed in about two years and offers comfortable amenities for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and an intensive care unit.
Bigger comfort for patients.
Changes that have been significantly recognized by patients will be affected by all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many people in one room need just one toilet on the floor, beds are inconvenient, windows are unsatisfied and health professionals do not have suitable conditions for work.
“For example, our boarding was built five years ago, and now it is at the border of its life,” said the director of the Zlínských hospital Pavel Calabek.
By a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-floor modern building connected to a urgent income.
Doctors and patients will thus have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to new spaces.
The same model already has half the finished Uherské Hradiště.
Central income is already in place and will be brought to it within three years.
“We will pay the loan and partly from our own resources,” explained the director Petr Sládek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
Zissk still has the highest, and it hasn't reached its loss two years ago, when the Zelín hospital had almost two hundred million dollars lost.
“We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, increase revenue and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital,” said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
The patient will also receive improvement in non-Kierch hospitals.
Within ten to fifteen years, he will go to repair, new instruments and reconstructions up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year will be a complete recovery station, then the dialy port begins, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

Nobody explained how I should keep the refugees in the country when they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of Interior Milan Chovaec (ČSSD) complains that the other Czech states are pushing for quotas for the recast of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
It also notes that no one has explained to him yet how the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should maintain when they do not want to live with us anyway.
“We didn’t get the answer, and that’s why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text,” Chovac told the journalists.
Can you describe the position with which you have come to the meetings of the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, they're heading somewhere, they've got some kind of relative.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to maintain our migrants in the territory of the Member States if they redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about that for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas solve everything?
We've had 40 grand a while ago, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When's five hundred thousand?
And how are we gonna keep those people in this territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all those who cross us want to go to Germany.
We just don't know how to hold them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as their target country, receive asylum in our country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, from Syria and other countries, is limitedly close.
You mentioned that the refugees don't really want us, but fifteen people are already committed to accepting.
Wouldn't it be possible to take more of them this way?
We're committed to accepting 1500 people, but with a condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even those 1500 are about to lose 1100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detection facility and treat them the same as the ones we caught.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe, if we can arrest people who are registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe is acting so that if they have registration, they cannot be held.
That means they will come to our territory with registrations, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may happen that even those 1100s will not remain in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will leave Germany again after the arrival.
If we can hold them for the period of asylum proceedings, we will deal with them in a asylum procedure.
If Syria’s citizens, Eritrea, nearly 98 percent of European statistics receive international protection.
Then they get documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will move.
That's the second project that's going on so far, and that's where we progressed only in discussing with the churches about the possibility that they could be able to help them get jobs, accommodation and so on.
But it's running on a very long track.
You said the other states were not willing to discuss with us at the meetings of ministers.
It is not, however, that the Czech Republic merely rejects quotas, but does it offer no solid step to unlock the discussion?
And what exactly is that supposed to be a solid step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says that all migrants from Syria can come to them, that message spreads in the hours after all camps around Europe, but also Turkey, Jordan.
It's another migration wave that's headed for Germany because they just don't want us.
We think that the way is protecting the external borders - just the migration waves to repel, help the necessary, and separate economic migrants.
I want them to make sure they don't have a chance.
Only last year, 50 thousand Kosovons came to Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturies of this state, including police, courts, state representations.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or receive them only according to the needs of the economy, the 50 percent of what the social systems spend on them today could go to refugees.
Unlike the first days, when Germany took control, the number of people held in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was twelve.
Where is it supposed to go to make controls at the borders even tight?
We were afraid to catch hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we manage.
We still have a few hundred free seats in stone detection devices.
Of course, all the people we hold will return to Austria within seven days.
We do it standardly.
The Rakus are the only ones who take those people away from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the break point?
Must it be like a thousand a day?
I think it might have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days, will drain our capacity so much that there will be crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would call for an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation arises, the government may sit down de facto immediately and one resolution would decide to strengthen the military police, give it a customs administration or a prison service.
The national variant is an exceptional state which has now declared Hungary in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Realize that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we only have the Schengen border and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to make this happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, shows that the Hungarians are trying to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched this very marginally, almost ever.
Slavia paid for the last minute a great deal of debt.
They're trying to prevent the announcement of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid the debts.
Even the football players were ready for their money.
Fotbal Slavia was held for the first time on Tuesday because of the insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after the proposal was submitted to Online Services from the Pacific Authority for about 20 million crowns.
The lawyer Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to judge Michael Wenzl within a few hours to convince him that he was not in charge of Slavia to declare a bankruptcy.
And it has to be said she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that a predominant week with the new owner of Slavie became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently, money came from the new owners to the club at the last minute.
This also shows the statement of Slavie before Tuesday's trial - the Warsaw Club on Monday, only on the day before the trial, sent tens of millions of crowns.
“All were killed between September 11th and September 15th,” said Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, to the Slovak ex-representant of Milan Ivan or to the Czech supporter Maria Ličkov.
Slavia also paid the fee to Agent Alexander Losenicek.
Already on Friday, the club paid also debt fees for the city part of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, de facto only claims that Slavie opposes.
Either according to the club in question, they did not come to an end, or they are held in court.
However, we are prepared to pay in the event of a loss of these disputes.
“We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can write off the account,” said Judge Mládková.
“All that has been paid after maturity is paid out,” Mládková declared and added that the non-payments are only invalid or broken down commitments.
It is also clear that the Judge will not decide in the coming days and that the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.
Then all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on 3 November.
However, the decision will not even take place at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is the representative of the latest generation of invertor holiday sources.
The combination of high-tech, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular construction brings benefits and rapid return on investments in the form of high-quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And any of this, from welding construction steel to welding special alloys, as well as from welding rough materials to welding thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in ships.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple setting and expansion of welding source allows you to quickly respond to changes in requirements, leading to a reduction of simplicity, the need to stop resources and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which provide higher productivity and welding quality.
It ceases to waste time and there is no waste of material or repairing faulty holidays.
Flexibility is ensured, is less simple, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's news, which had the Prime Minister in Nitra, where she also won the gold medal.
We appreciate these respects very much, because they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The leading world producers can boast of similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameter management, include FastMig X on the world tip.
For those who are interested, they are certainly pleasant to add deadlines that go around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts that will certainly expand after the Brno fair.
We have been his regular participants for over twenty years, and our business results are almost always better than before him, stressing for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsier, the manager of Kemppi's sales in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka was able to build up so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from a company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka went a lot safer, says the expert.
Blanka's tunnel designer, Alexander Butovič, claims the production director of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel.
He said that Wednesday night at the press tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
“Tunnel could have been more secure, but costs are rising on an exponential basis,” said Butovič.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all along, but the country fell only a few steps away from where it began to go with a safer and more careful method.
‘If this measure was used 500 metres earlier, a tunnel would be more expensive than half a billion,’ said Butovič.
Tunel Blanka went through three times during the construction.
Two times in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010, the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessary, said Euro weekly.
The construction was intended to cost CZK 17 billion.
When we add VAT, which has jumped twice in the construction period, from 17 billion, you have 11 billion.
When technology, acquisitions of land and engineering activity, valorization and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is no longer that far from the 37s, he said,
That's what someone ordered and paid for it.

Zisky FedEx mixed, reduction in fiscal perspective for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactionable results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of annual profit due to low demand for freight transport and higher costs for land division.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holiday.
This year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50 000 seasonal workers on holiday.
The shares of the company decreased by about 2.5 percent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before the Wednesday opening.
FedEx submits that he expects the pay between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a decline of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to the FactSet survey.
The reduced view comes despite an increase in interest rates on average by 4,9 percent, which is shown in January. 4, and higher charges for road transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it was still expecting an increase in profits compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
President of the Board of Directors and Director-General of Fred Smith said that the company, despite the weaker than the expected economic conditions, in particular in the processing industry and global trade, had been put forward.
Holiday hire plans were announced the day after the company UPS stated that it was planning to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, which was about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets have increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts asked by Zack expected $1.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused the revenue in its express unit to stabilise.
But boom online shopping has strengthened the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for bigger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in the freight trade due to higher prices for labour.
In the pre-market trade about an hour before the opening of FedEx’s shares fell by $3.85, or by 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline in 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the 11th June record.
At its most expected meeting in years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week at 27 feet of a long Dutch mahogany table and decide whether it is time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
The walling over them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story sitting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to give the nation's economic interests over everything else.
Central bank has double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep prices stable here.
However, from the great recession, Fedu’s representatives recognised that there was an unowned third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be notified on Thursday whether the American economy is ready to start at the disposal of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data show sound growth in the economy, recent turbulence on global financial markets could already frighten Fed due to adding to impermanence by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even more than a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is clear that the labour market and inflation will firstly be the most important thing to watch,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, the main economics of Stife Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think that they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the degree, an increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of the economies recently received by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to stand down, with a key indicator only about 30% of the chance to increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if Fed increases the rates, only if politicians negatively fail to fail to see further increase.
On Tuesday, the industrial diameter of Dow Jones jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4%, at 16,599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that politicians Fed will receive rates this week in peace, says John Loski, the main economics in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if Fed had now raised the rates,” states.
If Politicians Fed did this, they would have to go to the extremes of their programme statement and hold hands on financial markets so that they would not fail to panic.
Other experts claimed that the increase in tariffs would calm the financial markets, because it would remove uncertainty from how Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in slow monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over spring and early summer, she expects to increase rates this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed down in August, the labour market recorded solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level Fed considers to be full of employment.
The profites showed signs of lifting.
While inflation continues under the annual 2% target of central banks, Fed politicians claim that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, taking into account the tightness of the labour market, said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world began to throw away at the end of the past month after China devalved its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones decreased by up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing China economy would go down to global growth.
The market is somewhat reflected in this month and Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of May's maximum.
Fed’s political factors provide a comprehensive calculus in the market when to start an increase in interest rates.
In the absence of what happened in the financial markets and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a strengthening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, head of UCLA Ziman Center researcher for Real Estate and former official Fed.
They now predict that they will wait for at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
“There are many uncertainty about what impact it will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed became the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
A mere sign of President Ben Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could use their monetary expansion on the market, launched the quails around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly connected, Fed’s representatives are expected to observe developments elsewhere, but they also consult with other central bankers and experts in order to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Head of the Global Strategy for the Rich-Management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that “Fed has a history of overflows on financial markets that seem to be unrelated to economic foundations”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Committee for the Open Market, who pushed the increase in rates, quoted the decision in the years No.1999 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to a reduction in its reference rate by 0,75 percentage points during three meetings, despite limited identifiable effects on growth in the US, said Lacker.
One year later, Fed's representatives turned these cuts.
Fed should favour concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, as was the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Bank of England Committee.
The latest layer is not even close to this level, he said.
“You do not want to be in a situation of fear of growth in rates because markets have broken up,” said Posen, President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the top.

The speed on the highway stays old.
The acceleration to 150 km/h Sněmovna rejected.
On selected motorway sections, the maximum speed allowed shall not be increased to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, Sněmovna decided when she joined the Senate's amendment proposal, which refused to increase the speed.
The amendment of the Landing Law will now head to the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said by the end of April that the law allowing the ten-year-old speed to be tattooed.
The Minister of Transport Dan KYok (after ANO), according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built at such speed.
On Tuesday, Jok supported the Senate Version of the Law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-producers.
The House first extended this option to motorways which could thus be taken in selected sections by speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The Members have now come to his motion.
Senators with the consent of the transport minister from the amendment also issued the authorization of the transport police to have the last word in adapting local communications to which the municipalities are concerned.
The senate version approved by the House also counts in order to channel, water or cable public lighting can be stored longitudinally below the surface of the vehicle.
Foreigners would have saved for the purchase of land.
In addition, municipalities should not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local routes regardless of the owner of the property concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve the protection of roads and facilitate the use of alien loading with cast vehicles which are not reported by the owners.
The new municipality could sell unladen vehicles which, within a six-month period after notification of the withdrawal of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory across the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of fines even for freight companies.
The amendment also violates the possibility to introduce electronic highway marks instead of existing paper, which will be used as well after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The U.S. Expressor is in court.
He's been at risk of being welcomed to strangers for 10 years.
The case relates to an alleged project of the Remuneration of the Decorants.
The police also wanted to prosecute Zuzan Kail (ČSSD), but the Chamber of Deputies did not release it.
According to legal qualifications, the case threatens both to 10 years of prison.
The main ticket is scheduled for two October days so far.
According to the State Secretary of Mandík and Mack, at least one million crowns have caused damage, results from the prosecution.
The psalmist is leaning on the expert judgment.
Former members of the city's leadership, according to the applicant's title, have unlawfully made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company that organised the welcome of the people.
The Mandík, according to the prosecution, would have accused the chief of the local branch of services, education and culture to address five interconnected companies in the selection procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered into the competition was cancelled by the City Hall.
The order was then to entrust the city to the administrator and only the Darothore company, which then assigned the city council to the contract.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges were led to ensure that Daroth’s award of public contracts for the holding of events Received by the Visitors in Usti nad Labem has acted at least contrary to the demand for a proper economic operator’s care procedure, writes the state attorney.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore was subsequently charged the Saver over Labem for the implementation of the Receipting of the prize, which would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company, according to the file for the project, has written more than five million crowns.
Finally, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then it resigned.
The amount paid was at least one million crowns, according to the expert's assessment.
The Mandík once refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit a crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this bail, he's already told the former Mayor that the city under his leadership has just made a similar project from the past years.
In 2008 to 2010, Roxy II provided the event.
“It was under the same conditions, under the same money,” Mandík added.
The criminals originally wanted to accuse Mrs Kayl, who was also a member of the city council.
But the House of Deputies didn't leave her to the prosecution.
Therefore, the criminals in her case have dropped the case of a case, but they count on the fact that Kail's accusations after she has ended her mission.
The welcome of the villagers was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly let go of a dog fugitive.
Then the reporters got the record deleted.
The Hungarian police said at the border with Serbia briefly arrested the cameraman of the AP agency and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the refugee country.
However, the Hungarian government is questioning this accusation.
The given incident happened on Saturday night when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who across the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
The fugitives advanced the police and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his face.
The dog of a man who shouted, “Please, I am a fugitive,” says Muzi.
The fact that Muzi is filming everything, he noticed one of the cops, and he didn't let him leave.
Then the reporter couldn't make a phone call to his superiors, nor to his colleagues on the spot anymore.
Police officers took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had in charge.
Then they ordered him to erase the record.
Music has thus lost the result of two days work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
A.P.A. sent a protest letter to the Hungarian Government of Zoltán Kovács.
The behaviour of police officers in it was unacceptable and claimed that journalists should have the opportunity to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, with appealing to a police report on Muzi's reporting of events, questioned.
He said the police just wanted the press to show them whether they were on some of the footage they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him.
“The dogs can bark - they are trained to scare off and fear a little, but they certainly did not attack,” says Kovács.
Unforgivable League of Masters.
The prize in City will kick us, believe us Juventus
“It’s disappointment, I don’t think we deserve to lose,” said Manuel Pellgrini, the coach of hometown.
We had more chances, and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic league of masters.
Not one team made too many opportunities, but we had the ball on the hills longer.
“The fate of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals,“ he evaluated the pellegrini game, whose team had been kasing in the contest game after 636 minutes.
This finalist of the last season of Juventus was exactly the opposite of each other - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has as much as the lawyer titled only point and score 2:4 is located on the 16th place of the table.
That's why the turn to Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
“This win will be psychologically helpful, he will kick us,” believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala.
In Manchester, Pogba, Manchuch, and Morata started them.
- It's true, this victory is very important, perhaps because of it we will find a winning wave, - Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
We were better at the second half, especially at the attack stage.
This result deserves my players.
“By the other hand, we could have copied it to 0:2, but Gianluigi held us,” praised Alegri Golman Buffon's coach.
“We have burned down some good chances,“ Yayu Tourý, a supporter of City.
We have to take from the League of Experience masters and try for a better outcome next time.
Good-bye, Angela, good-bye to old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that the whole media banging around is managed by professionals.
According to media needs and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of kids who carry their parents on their hands in the dustlands of exodus.
And this causes man - i.e. in a European man - automatically feelings of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate kids, notice the images of the incoming boats to the Greek islands that the children are not so much to see!
Well, somehow we have disappeared from television recently, images of ships heading to Lampedus, fleeing from the French border near Menton, with thousands of young men at whose beautiful Promenades lay low.
A lot of young black people.
And the images from Callais have also disappeared, where these snows and black men are waiting for them to go through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think she's taking it anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian Church of Eritrea have made no special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of this has been a waste of falsehood.
So when it's a quota for escape, it's kind of a secret that it's not just about unfortunate children from Syria, but also about the established - for older people: fashioned - young men.
Their musculatures look like they're just coming out of some kind of fit center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no hams.
And they came out of them young black.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in brand clothes and shoes, in their hands, as otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, it was not interested and employees - Turks, Muslims!
They've taken out all the leopards.
Whoever didn't lie on it and was right in the sea had bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper film.
On the heads of the hat with nails, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they got to the local beach bar and started to throw.
They've put tables around, set themselves up next to sitting snowy and white guests of the bar - read Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children were running out of the dining terrace somewhere to relax.
The incoming black men drank beer straight from the third - as in the US series?! - on the beach they threw empty bottles around each other.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
Of course, it wasn't English.
Then they got into the wine drink, too, straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimmers, especially those young ladies - in the water they screamed and shouted, mothers with children and pensioners fled and in half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the pool or no one black guest.
They're all gone.
Whether someone was a Christian or Muslim.
The hotel staff were worried about them, too, just to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in half the evening: ‘You saw the gold that they had in them.
- Yeah, I said.
- Well, they certainly didn't have it from work, - said the waiter.
I remembered: ‘I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had about 20 inches of a massive gold cross on his neck.
And women were like gold.
- These are drug smugglers - I asked.
“You've always seen them drink,” the waiter said.
They don't do drugs, they don't even use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 it was not so important to me yet.
I had no idea what would follow.
But secret services and top politicians should know that first.
I don't think they'd know.
Some 1.5 million immigrants were released in Europe at that time.
And they go and go and go.
Today, it has been shown that the European Union's main problem is that the totalitarian-political-correcting politicians, such as intellectuals, and they have the greatest strength of lobbyist and economically important groups in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, also the tip of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent TV images about the exciting welcome of fugitives in Germany are at the level of Moscow’s television film from August 1968.
Of course, there were some Sunflowers at the station, but mostly - old-fashioned - Muslims welcomed their soukmen.
For the long weeks, they've been wobbling in the news on Czech TV, as said by some research, the Germans are almost all for the arrival of migrants.
However, who was only a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, famous research of public opinion organized by the ARD - Czech Society of Public TV companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TV used to do.
However, they concealed what the next day broke in Germany: that in an annex vote for the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want to have any immigrants.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, i.e. five years ago, said: ‘Our efforts to ‘multi-chulti’culti have completely failed’.
She also said: ‘Niemko gives up the fight for multicultural society -
“All attempts to use such a life have failed totally”
In a country where four million Muslims live, according to her, there was no strategy that allowed people from a variety of cultural environments to live next to each other without integrating themselves, and today they live with us, and we were lying for a while that they wouldn't stay that one day they would disappear again.
That's not real.
Multicultural approach, when we think we're just living happily next to each other, failed this approach.
Absolutely failed.
But even Merkel may not have the power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political integrity.
It shows an escalation of events.
The fight is growing fast.
Euromec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, the only one who has no talent in the Europarlia - yes, it is the one that Berlusconi in the EU Parliament has said that he could play a concentration overseer for a minute - as he has done more.
It seems, especially under the impression of the recent statements of German politicians, that Germany exceeded Rubicon.
Let us note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the state states that were victims of Naziism are inherited.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least on the outside, to deal with their horrific past aggressor and a million killer?
Are they right about what they say in the soul of Germany the devil of aggression, superiority, violence?
Was he right, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when all his strength stopped the Greater attempts to control the whole center of Europe?
When did he say that the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When they stopped him, she started preparing for World War I.
The Great German thought, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, has probably returned in another form.
Following the attempt of Marxists to control the state, such as the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of nacism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long prevented the creation of German nationalism, and so they left all those atom fighters in their room, enthusiasts looking for paradise for everyone, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password of our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who want to do something differently and better everywhere, they have fully leaned on the side of planet heating fighters, they have stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semite - so-called pro-Palestinian stream - and an anti-Slovan stream considering all the Slovaks as a difficult verse - already from Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements show, Schulze and the German Mints, who are openly threatening to the disobedient eastern states, the idea of the leadership of Germany.
Which must be listened without saying.
Otherwise, you're a white man!
And when we get to it that immigrants are a very sensitive group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is as always the capital, especially the German one that meets and which means that Germany is actually controlled by the banks and the Union by most of the countries of Europe.
The Sunflowers’ pedagogue first introduced the German into the swamp of ecology and multictalism, and today brought them home and perhaps brought millions of Muslims.
Who, the broken voices of siren, will soon run into the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start to storm.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, it can once again some of its inhabitants - but as it seems, still smaller - ideologically stray, but eventually reality will bring him back as always.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostel is on fire.
What will the German government do when the German protests against incoming Islamists come out?
Do Muslims have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, following the fear of Islamization of their country?
What will it do with the Germans, and even with Germany, when people who will be loud and publicly protested against the new euro-wide Muslim?
Germany just changed.
A conflict that has created the support of sunnic ideology in Europe, i.e. ideologies of elites and, in principle, total, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the infallible democratic Germans and all the subordinate and disobedient Eastern neighbours, it can't do well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the found sellers: scare them to death.
All you have to do is knock and the robust curse fell upon you in a way that is weaker than it is necessary to stop.
A living head will take you down and get you poisoned, and they will escort you away (or rather marry) an impoverished seller and a living statue.
Maybe it's a shame you can't even get a talking cage.
Even with us, there would be a lot of excavations and crap.
Bedding (Oxalis corniculata).
A little weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And so it's located between the outdoor tiles near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which, although one of the expansion peers, looks like a nice impression of flowering.
The outdoor tiles are located.
She's out of her mind, she's in the garden with us.
She likes a dryer environment, she's easily adaptable, modest and unattractive.
It creates leaves with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching it and taking pictures.
The beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple escort are just under minor consideration.
The Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breast feeding
The Brazilian pedagogical SPRS came with a shocking way of trying to mediating women’s knowledge of the importance of good diets during breast feeding through pictures of children painted by the display of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates which supply infants all the nutrients they need to create for a strong immune system.
Due to the energy requirements, pregnant women and newborn mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure to be followed by mothers.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic production of their children and protected them from tumour development.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the Chambers, although Nine's trying to take charge of the Today Show
As part of Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra due to the cost of the escape of the liberal lead, there was no sufficient increase in the evaluation for Today.
In the morning, Nina's show of national capital after the collapse of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage is stuck in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny to the distance of the viewers of Aussie TV was so important because it recorded 397 000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330 000 broadcast viewers Today.
Today, a smaller increase in its evaluation compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was over the last quarter (343 000).
Today in the last few months fills the gap on Sunris.
In August, 318 000 compared to 330 000 in Sunris on the average of today.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has, on average, 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change influence more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The great news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thompson.
The new drama of a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the central part of New Zealand, has a very impressive 1.219 million viewers on average.
The critics considered whether Thomson himself could pull a TV hit without the Rafters Rebecca Gibney star.
The result of last night is clear - yes -
The X Factor of Seven has left a strong 1.116 million viewers, smoothly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Familias (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings of the second night The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV show (from 17:00 to 17:30), which was exhibited by Andrew O'Keefe, had an average of 446 000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 viewers, which was enough to win the Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, she had the first half hour of The Chase Australia on average 520 000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620 000.
Due to the decline in the rating The Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute, which could not defeat McGuiro show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy, but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have found out who will win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is wrapped with an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay standing will certainly not tell who the real one is, which will eventually get roses.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they only stayed two, they would never tell us who was going to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday final.
All three lyricky women have wondered why Wood is a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, ‘If not, which will get Wood's final flower?, they could work as a connector about who gets the heart of Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, so Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would fit Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing a light relationship from one day forward.
“From the moment I entered the house and watched Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible and still think about it during the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah is really a country woman, she has a lot of fun,” she added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're well and well together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could make a nice couple.
For her alone, she felt that during her last visit at home she realized that Wood could be the right one--
\"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now,\" he adds.
I asked him who Wood would pick if she didn't, she looked mysterious.
\"I don't know if I can say it,\" she said.
I love both girls anyway - it's between Snezena and Lana inadvertently.
Bachalor's on Wednesday at 7.30 to Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several ways to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States and a lot of teams were asked after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and looks like a reasonable decision.
Some of the trainers had Hayne sit down for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian rugbi league at the first foot dig at Tuesday 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also still honest in the game closet.
Instead of getting the new guy to eat before the rest of the team, he can cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the game.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, declared that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his mistake and take care of just another game.
Already during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarrid Hayne fixed his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian Radio Duu Hamish & Andy to 2DayFM 104.1 worse start of his career in NFL he could not imagine.
“That happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in its own brandy territory led to three Queenslad.
Overall, it was a great experience for 27-year-old players.
Hayne published a photograph with fans on which he held the Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russia Vladimir Putin will meet in discussions on homosexual rights
In 2003, the richest man of Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by gunmen at the Siberian ranch.
After Mr Vladimír Putin had openly questioned, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic effort was limited.
The U.S. became an emigrant who made the replacement of the property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and acquired a new owner of the property.
After 1989, the assets could no longer be recovered, so the pair turned to claims for compensation under the Act on Involuntary Rehabilitation.
The court first granted them the amount requested, i.e. over 2,8 million crowns, but the Board of Appeal changed their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90 000 with a reference to the fact that the amount of the refund is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Emigrants had become the Supreme Court, and they had the original defendant's claim.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, but it turned to complaints about the US.
In the intervening period there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted in accordance with the legislation in force at that time - would then constitute a compensation of adequate in relation to the withdrawal of the property - now only a fraction of the value of the property is achieved.
“This cannot go to the burden of the parties involved in the restitution of the authorised persons who have at least claimed their rights since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier,” explained the rapporteur, Jarosslav Fennyk, why ÚS had stood on the side of the emigrants.
The Court of Justice has repeatedly called on the General Courts to proceed in reinstitutional matters to ensure that any indifference is not interpreted in the non-conformity of the authorised persons and that the purpose of the restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. the recovery of property damage caused by the acts of the former Totalitarian State, should be added to the judge.
Evitu at the musical study DVA now established by Radka Fišar.
By the way, Radka Fišar became the world's youngest Eve when in 1998, in her 20 ’ s, she established the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timea Rice in the Prague theatre of Spiral.
To return to the same role he says: “To this day, the challenge of Evita has not been balanced by much of the performance.
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
In the role of the first ladies, Argentina recommended her to Monica Absalom.
I saw Monk three times in Evieta, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
This is where I saw a whole new concept.
I'm a totally favourer of modern adjustments, but this one is just particularly leading.
The director, Ondrej Sokol, is original, relaxed and contemporary, says Fišarová.
The final transmission of the musical iron between the two singers takes place at Monika Absaloon's birthday concert on September 27th, 19th in the Studio DVA Theatre.
In the evening, Evita's music compositions are up.
It will certainly belong to the experiences of the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (You will honor your cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondrej Sokol will also take place from the real artist when he takes part in the film of Karl Roden as President Perón.
For the sake of public interest, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita reports Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Ondrej Sokol's main female role was originally taught by Monica Absalom.
Following her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenačik.

4 people were killed after the police shot rubber designs on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including four-year-old boys, were killed in Southern Nepal after the police fired rubber designs in the crowd of demonstrators against the proposal of the new state constitution, said at the center of the official.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi quarter, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu City.
Bistu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officer, states that more than 1,000 demonstrators have gathered before the police station and some have thrown stones and burnt bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used the tear gas and then fired it in the air before they moved to the rubber designs.
Twenty police officers and five civilians have been injured, reports.
It was not immediately clear why rubber designs, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have clearly caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the Southern Plan of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they set up new provinces under the proposed new constitution and eased their political influence.
Another demonstration in Western Nepal has also been recorded by the Thai ethnic group, which requires the creation of its own state.
At least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes since August 10, including 11 police officers.
when four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, a big step in meeting the new constitution, but a very disputed question in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled for centuries.
The work in the new constitution lasts since 2008, but the legislators have speeded up the process of destroying earthquakes that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week in Kathmandu for the provisions of the draft constitution and the officials state that the new Charter should be adopted in Sunday.
We definitely can't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of master Litvínov you did not manage the home duel with the hockey player Sparta (3:5).

I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC predicts the 60% probability of cyclonon south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the scariest Cape Verde Islands has a probability of 60 percent in the development of tropical cyclones in the next 48 hours, said the American National hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another well defined low pressure system about in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Malmimonians has also 60 percent probability in the development of tropical cyclic formation in the next two days, added weather thresholds based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to choose $111 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said that it launched a campaign aimed at choosing $111 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states while fleeing the war of rejected and poor countries. Each selected amount of Google doubles.
Google announced this on his blog a very unusual way.
Reported on her blog by a staff member, Googlu Rita Mauduk, based on personal experience, when she was a seven year old fleeing with her family from Kabul.
“We experienced hunger, thirst, winter, and fear in many dark trains and buses,” said Maudou.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, there are more and more families like this, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made via google.com/refugeelief up to $5,5 million double.
Europe is facing the greatest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, a four-year war that only drove 4 million people out this year.
Many are also fleeing from the war of rejected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly Oedicated diabetes, useful weight surgery could be
The benefits of weight loss in surgery for slightly osteomy people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too soon to say whether mildly circumstantial people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those provided by non-irrurgic therapy.
“The experience of mortality lasts long to display,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to the new study of JAMA.
Operation for weight loss, bariatric surgery uses different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
During the years, bariatric operations have proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the relationship of weights relative to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indicate the excess of the person and people with a value above 30 are considered to be opaque.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan have used data collected from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and Gastroectomy - in treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly circumcised.
The average BMIs among those undergoing surgery dropped according to study 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMI remained the ones that were not provided with surgery for diabetes, about the same value of 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent of patients were resolved to compare diabetes and in part only about 2 percent of patients.
Also, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and poor LDL cholesterol was demonstrated to be generally better in the surgical group, - they found the authors.
Researchers also monitored the patient’s haemoglobin level A1c in the blood that reflects the continuous blood sugar level in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, reports researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin value of A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, this value remained at around 8 percent in the treatment group.
But this better -glycaemic control - which reflects at better haemoglobin levels A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, a group with bypass lost more weight compared to a group of Gastrocectomy (18.7 against 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and Haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent against 2.1 percent) and had a higher probability of remissioning of diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, foreign people who have undergone bariatric surgery had about 29 percent higher chance of survival in the next 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although a new study has not shown improvement in survival between patients after surgery, Blackstone’s view is a satisfactory result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
“Just here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with less BMI, - without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it states.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the patient’s BMI decline between 27 and 30.
“I think we are waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that when one gathers these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really heavy.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the near East.
The Tibetan leader of Buddhists has called for the end of violence in refugee home countries.
Dalai Lama dealt with the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech when opening the Dalai Lama Centre for Compasion in Oxford, which focuses on the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
It also stressed that the response of the Western European countries, however admirable, was inadequate in this situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said.
Although Dalai Lama commended the efforts of Germany and Austria in solving the crisis, he stressed that this was just a temporary solution.
“Take care of several thousand refugees is beautiful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring true peace and real development, especially through education of these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also expressed an action against George Bush after a 9/11 terrorist attack and claimed that the US’s strong response caused a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11 I expressed my sincere condolences in President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to resolve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have experienced an ambulance in the last 4 years
Tox screen centers around the United States have reported nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years who have hunted high alcoholic sanitary agents, according to the toxicological center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopeze, the director of the toxicological centre of Georgia, the number of children's health resources under 12 years of age reported on the poison control centre increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
“Those children are more likely to receive these products and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who must be taken to an emergency,” said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitary equipment intentionally while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Youtube videos show teenages how to drink ambulances because of cheap habits.
Respectably, they mixed an ambulance with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by an attractive smell.
“The children do not think that it might hurt them,” Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (santitative means) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary devices with scents of strawberries, grep or oranges that are very appealing to children.
Sanitation agent contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, several locations may be alcohol poisoning.
“One of the highly concentrated alcohols,” said Fox 4 in Kansas City Medical Director of the Control Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let the whiskey slide, either, but people leave these ambulances outside and when their children get to them, it's a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who had recently died in school to four locations of an ambulance accident with a smell of strawberries and was taken away because of emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold values considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside the Atlantic.
Nhaijah spoke unfaithful words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because a girl fell for alcohol and hit her head, reports Ritchey.
\"It was very scary,\" said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended the parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange that they were sanitary devices from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitary devices have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after a swallowing of an ambulance that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Health professionals believed that the product included methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was presented as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in northern New York planned to poison their “bad” teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room, according to police reports.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary devices and prohibits their presence in the room.
The police have assessed the frozen plan as an innocent crowd, and referred to discipline in the school district,
Fama: No conflict on Celtic team
Griffins bagatableizes the talk of a failure in Celtic, while Diila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll turn it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements of January will disrupt the team unit.
Dons increase their lead over Celtics by 5 points
Penalta of the first half in ADAMA Rooney's submission secured Aberdeen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, making Dons a five-point drive between himself and Celtice.
Griffins denying the talk of non-compliance
This situation has caused gossip about a failure in Celtic which has been denied the Griffiths, which insists that he and his co-founders do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for the fight against the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel under pressure, and I think the players are looking forward to it.
Insufficient in Scottish title quality boredom Netherlands - de Boer
Former Deputy Rangers and former Dutch Representative Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador to Ajax, states: “In the Netherlands they no longer show the best of the games of Celtic, and why -
Because they're not Rangers anymore.
People here don't just talk about the return of Rangers.
He's talking about an old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the fights of the Old Company, and not just the Scottish people are watching these games.
I turn things back to good things, she commits to Neil.
RONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a bit surrounded, but the Norwegian boss committed things to turning back to good.
The Malm defeat and the following fall from the League of Masters was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players, and now he's turning at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says: “Celectic has had a bad time and will rise again.
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really mad or sad at the current events.
We're exactly the same -- but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton is concerned about the January reinforcements
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago, and indicated that he had already identified some of his January targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of force and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team unit.
Former Chief Brentford states: ‘The Led's crossing window is very different from that summer -
Players who come in the summer have a whole pre-zoning period, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage arises by adding the needy players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target suggests retirement
The attacker Swansea Mich, who was associated with Celtic in the crossroad window, suggested that he could retire after the termination of his contract with Swansea.
Two-year-old shooter has been having problems with a susceptible ankle for two years, and he couldn't find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - it is the third red card issued by the Judge Collum, which was canceled.
Neilson is behind his claim and says: “I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.
Griffins committed to avoiding Tynecastle.
The stubborn Hibbe was strictly shown after he admitted that he sang a song with a text aimed at former Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roserburn in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
“One thing about the derby and it was a high moment,” the attacker said, “I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle if it is not in the Celtic suit”
The Tandacy Council believes in Dundee United - Donelle
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in correcting the situation of the team's current management - but admits that the fall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to move again, - she promises Donnelly.
MCInnes is happy to win for “a nasty victory” against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team must have been desperately held against Hamilton Accies in order to succeed in winning the seventh league victory after itself and the five-point drive before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half in the submission of Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: “There is no team that won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of game,
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged while overall unemployment of UK is rising
Scotchness remains unchanged in the number of 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The level of Scottish unemployment 5.9 percent was above the UK peace (5.5 percent) as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland has dropped by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers has now stopped at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased to 74.0 percent during the quarter - which is the number above the British average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell said in his comment on the latest data: ‘The long-term government plan has set the foundations for a stronger economy’
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made historic decisions to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we saw further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment grew while unemployment fell.
Why I witnessed executions in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will follow the death of a man.
If this happens, and I hope it won't happen, I'll sit in a tour of the gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will witness his death.
I first received an invitation in January over my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When that day comes, I'm starting to worry about it.
Why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
The offer would make me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow executions in America and because there are often more requests than free seats, there is a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the entire execution unnoticed.
I can't do that.
I'll sit by the side of the closest friends of Richard Glossip and create a special connection to him through months of calls and one or two and a half hours visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness at the same time and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being on Twitter that I am intimidating my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell him the story of the breeder as he's going to apologize to it, get in touch with it.
I've been complaining about her.
She admitted that “this could formulate better,” but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story in place.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't be sure to say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would make him guilty of his fellow crime.
But I believe that there is a great probability that he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
And right from this perspective, I'll be watching his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love to die useless death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase.
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he evicted a man from Canning River.
A man's bet from Petrhu didn't go after he got into shallow mud just meters from a police officer who tried to forcefully persuade him to return to the shore.
Canning Vale P.D. was called at an incident exceeding Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw a suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
“I’m not going out again, just come and get me,” said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavic just wanted to get a uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic, and that was police negotiations.
“Sometimes people try to do funny things when they escape,” said Castledine.
The Ben Cousins football champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race.
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria that he tried to get a spy last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organizers and the Department of Integration of Racing Victoria and he was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai during the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation as regards Lidarin's positive cobalt paint, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue about spying charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a \"dry threat.\"
\"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once,\" Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight, and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best for them.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Previously on Moody, he released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
“For 18 months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call after the question - and offered him employment in my stables for finding out the information about the things that they do in my stables,” said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an effort to catch me, they've completely burned down.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Does RVL grow up a few balls and make people take responsibility outside the coaching position for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need me to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm saying is giving them material to think about.
But I got to a point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push on them, and I will take their burdens to make decisions.
I have my family's support and I can go away.
The levels of frustration of the coach increased with a long-term cobalt investigation, including Lidari and the recent scratching in it, felt that it could, perhaps, a clock of his licence on the table,
Moody, the most famous for the preparation of the failed champion Black Caviar, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the race as “smotherful” - after the horses were applied to the clay lining or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
Someone from my team accidentally brought a mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened too.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody was faced with three months of disqualification for the treatment of the site on the day of the race for which the organisers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
“We all understand that we need the rules, but this went too far,” he said Moody.
The Kobram driver who ran away was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a biker on Cobramo weekend and left after a collision.
Bikes were air transported to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by cars on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be accused of stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic barriers.

Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy is returning a hit against rivals because of a wrestling claim.
Craig Bellamy, Coach Melbourne Storm, criticized the cover of his players as a “stated plan” - two NRL favorite Prime Ministership.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the referee allowed the storm players to “rest” his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the Sydney qualifier final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, Coach Brisbane Broncos, made a lightly covered remark on Strorm after his team won the qualification finals of North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game as a “walking” - rugby league, and according to him two of Queenslad were not too large - for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the cover of his players and said that they were focused on contact during them.
Bellamy added that this situation made him more confident because his team is criticized by two trainers, which may mean that they are afraid of defeating the Storm team.
\"I still don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,\" he said on Wednesday, Bellamy.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, the last few weeks we've just put emphasis on contact during surgery, and that meant a turnover for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how these things always come in this year's time.
Bellamy disassembled Bennett's idea of \"extended football\" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won in 2010 by the premiere of the \"nut\" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday play as exciting as ours. She was also as exciting,” said Bellamy.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that seems to be disruptive, especially his young backups with their speed.
You'd like to play that football if you had this type of player available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backups like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that style cannot play.
It gives me more confidence because they say such things because they worry about fighting against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals fell in the match of Storm and Roosters than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it an exciting football?
Or are the breaks and failures interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, that means we'll definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm has this weekend's break and won the right to host either North Queensland Colonboys or Crollalla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night in AAMI Park. The tickets will be available from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man won a deposit of USD 200 000 for drug charges
The man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled from Queensland received a bail of USD 200 000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men who arrested federal police for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht that arrived from South America through Vanuatu and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovice was seen in a meeting with the accused at the port during the morning and later met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for the fact that he had commercial-quality cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovice had set up a defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the whole quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop completely by accident and innocent.
The judge of the Supreme Court Peter Flanagan believed that he had escaped from Maksimovic.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said in the middle of court.
He lied to the police about where he lived in the crown case.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice together offered a bail of USD 200 000 for his release.
“After reading the strict statements of both persons, it is clear that the deposited bail of USD 200 000 is a real financial burden for them,” declared Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts were clearly insufficient, since the accused did not come further to trial, he warned.
The Maksimovice was awarded bail on condition that both the Australian and the Serbian passports give up daily notice to the police and will comply with the ban on the exit from 18 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Steve Hogg used the girl's phone to lure the pedophiles to send images
Pedophile used the phone of 11-year-old girls to get photos of child abuse.
Steve Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, then applied to her online chat, where he had a lot of dirty photos of children who sent him another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing her phone, and then found it in Hogg's hand.
She went through it, and before she pointed out to her mother, she found some disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photographs, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a quiet search on the site using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was to “put pedophiles on the Internet before he pretended to be a police officer and scared them”
Eilidh Robertson, a Finnish representative, said to Dundee Shreiff Court: “He said that it was an addiction - that he was dependent on the abuse of people.
He admitted he was doing the search on the computer, but he said he wanted to pretend that he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked at his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.
According to him, he did it to lure them.
He says that he's been skipping him in the drunks and saying he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When a girl found messages on her phone, she called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of an action concerning the acceptance or granting of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the terms of bail on 25 January and did not come to a hearing in court on 24 March this year.
The attorney of the defense Gregory Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual offenders because he could argue that in his act there was no essential sexual subtext -
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed his judgment to October due to the report of social workers.
Hogg was awarded bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing of other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zembabwský Robert Mugabe presented a bad speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, African oldest leader, earlier this year fell on the stairs leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became a virtual in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also undermined by the opposition legislators’ claims that they received anonymous threats of killing which warned them against Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they sang him and provoked him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Chairman of the Music Club for Democratic Change (MDC), Incent Gones, said that seven opposition politicians adopted text messages on their mobile phones with warnings not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
“The report comes from numbers that will not appear, but is named 'Death',” told the journalists after Mr Mugabe’s speech.
He warns the members concerned to know that the immunity ends in Parliament and, once they step out of Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The Chief stated that Morgan Tsvangirai led by the party had a lot - about threats to the Members.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancellation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the course of its restructuring efforts and the cost savings of business services.
HP will be divided into two companies on the stock exchange later this year and separate its business with computers and printers from its faster and faster business hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, as reported by HP.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” states Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP and the Chairman of the Board, who will become the head of the unit after distribution.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a wide and large portfolio of shops that will help businesses switch to new business styles,” said Whitman.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the emerging requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will send a statement to the company of more than $50 billion and will focus on providing uncompetitive integrated technological solutions to society.
This will be the distribution of the company, which was founded in 1930 by the University of Stanford Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was overlooked by the Hilicon Valley.
HP was going through massive reorganizations to make it possible to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP, the second largest PC producer and one of America's largest technical companies, is the latest of this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Captain Mikel Arteta says the co-masters must get behind the wounded Jack Wilsher before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also pointed out for Wilsher that he was still just glowing and, if his rehabilitation went according to plan, there is no reason not to play Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will surely miss at least another four English games and, from the perspective of history, its involvement in the next summer European Championship, is clearly uncertain.
The great damage to this new problem is that Wilshere ended the past season strong after the ankle injury and then again got into the former form during the previous season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten a career,” says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not concern his ankles or the injury that he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
The survey carried out by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilsher injuries since he had his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he played only 65 league games of Arsenal from the total number 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs, which lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of an initial circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of the injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
You have a vulnerable period, when you need to strengthen your body and gain a competition, says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he'll have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in Lize champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreeb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to shoot his team.
Hétor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta probably will.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreala Theo Walcott.
“I try to maintain balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the progress of the F Group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season they held a campaign - uninhabitable -
The stadium was shot by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
That was this year in Zagrebu.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal learned from last season of League Champions, when he capped against Monaco and remained a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
“This deployment is enormous,” says Wenger.
The Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand I must be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
Absence of similar views in different shows is in the eyes of beating, especially given how men need to open up desperateer than ever, in the case of suicide between young men within 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserable (CALM) 2015 as the Year of Man, whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this fight there is a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing signs of depression found that if the damaged had a high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Even for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of developing mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be available first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, an immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a deep influence on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and the creator of the game recently explained, money really doesn't buy any more luck.
The beautiful series of friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but their personalities, which were lit by means of friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the time of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the laundering from knowing that, yes, men can also identify themselves, even though they usually keep their feelings for themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ... my role as listeners of people who feel depressed or have suicide tendencies confirmed to me that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference--
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying - dealing with this - is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up the problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will arise in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It highlights little moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of outsider on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a larger close network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FriendsFest station Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what difference your friendship can do.
Friends series will be sent to Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - full 236 episode - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG close the Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavanim after shooting goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut in Lize Masters and helped the PSG on Tuesday defeat the Swedish Malmo team.
Here's a message about the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani scored both in the Tuesday game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in Lize Masters with a final comfort win of 2-0 against Malmu on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Lize Masters and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then threw some chances after finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only focused on the qualification of the decommissioning wheels, but on improving their journey to the quarterly recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they received three points, it was not the classic performance of Laurent Blanc's team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was in front of the prodigal goal and later he was represented against his home team and the club in which he started his famous career in 1999.
“In Lize Masters it is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents a problem and looks comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things we need to improve with season procedure,” said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, but I regret not shooting one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes of the PSG team, which at home lasted this weekend with 2-2 with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but in the fourth minute he was abducted by Di Mario.
Argentinian wing was marked as a man who would shift PSG to a new level after crossing from Manchester United, who had passed last month, and showed why when he ran into Marc Verratti's passport behind Malma's defense and sent the ball behind Johan Wildand's back to the distant corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to begin with a grand victory of PSG, they had to be disappointed.
The Malmo that defeated Celtic in the playoff and got to this stage took 9 internationals in the basic lineup and five defenders and two covered supporters were a heavy opponent.
But besides the shootings of Nikola Djurdjice, which was just a minute away from the corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG himself was about to benefit from the attack with bad threats and a miserable ending, which was not good or good from Ibrahimovice, which could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shooting arrived in the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed up a lot more suitable when he came to prepare the chances for his classmates and it was just from his credit card when Di Maria sent a rolling shot that ended up in Wland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayec head sent a sixth goal this season after Ibrahimovich played him after he played the game from Maxwell's left wing.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make something out of the game, and only the excellent test of Wilanda from a great distance made David Luize's hope and score unaltered even when the goal of the alternating Ezekiel Lavezzi was not recognised at the end of the match.
He admitted that PSG were above his team, Nor said: ‘Our last game in Lize Masters took place in December last year’
Since then, we've only played a Swedish league that's not exactly the same.
The qualifier fights aren't enough.
Knock down for Paris.
It was a wonderful fight for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
Glencore mining giant, based in Switzerland, which was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, earned in the middle of $2.5 billion of the sale of shares in the framework of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in her statement that she sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This year, the company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is facing commodity price managers, as China's slowdown in the economy reduces demand and infests the sparks across the markets.
The legal problem was sent to Glencore on Wednesday at the top of the London stock market in early morning stores.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 coins on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore discovered last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of the wider plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which has accumulated about a third of its assets.
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 coins per share, which marked 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in total price of 9,99 percent per group.
The concerns regarding the extension of Chinese growth's sounding decreased the price of iron ores by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the USA at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25th in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the President welcomed the report in November.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Lyuan for a public dinner that will take place after the interview.
“The President’s visit to Xi represents an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the US and China and to cooperate in addressing problems in international, regional and shared interests and is an opportunity to provide a constructive debate on the disadvantages of both countries,” adds a report.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN September session.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with the problems involved, including Washington's concern of the alleged cyber-defence of China and its increasing aggression in the waters of South China.
How the refugee crisis spread the Schengen area.
The Nous lights were lighted by Germany from far away by the European crew, but it is already pushing the ship to change the course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union decided to deal with the refugee problem: rather, it will systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than to argue because of the future division of refugees according to quotas based on the quantity which is increasingly given up.
Six days after Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to relinquish 160 thousand refugees, to change the priority of the interiors of the Member States.
Before taking care of the final destination of runners, it is necessary to filter those who are coming today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
The effective management of the external borders of the EU is essential for the management of migration,\" notes the text discussed by ministers on Monday in Brussels.
Following the crisis, the common currency finds the EU at risk in its next large integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its credibility and increase pressure.
It restores border checks, especially with Austria, but without blocking the tide of those looking for asylum in this country.
The central power makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia have already joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, even though with varying intensity.
Hungary has made it a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now an effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone into the interior.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it's realized from fat.
In Italy, according to informal statistics, two thirds of new arrivals have already been registered and identified.
The Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory because it fears more than others to remain on its bedside camps in which refugees would gather on its account.
Greece remains a real black hole.
In his islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200,000 people arrived this year, which is twice as close to the recent arrival in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they went through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge opening.
Athens, which are still in the financial breakup and waiting for the new government, put their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and the source of common concerns for the German Chancellor Angela Mercel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The Juncker Commission promises that the introduction of control points will take place as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
“The challenges facing Greece apply to Europe as a whole,” they agreed on Monday, on behalf of the EU Home Minister on the mobilisation of this front.
It is therefore important to deploy in this country an intervention team of the European Agency for the control of the Frontex border.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum beneficiaries and strengthen the surveillance of islands.
The text submitted to ministers for approval will be adequate financial resources.
In terms of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the eight-year-olds, as the second turn, moved the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was already established by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, which strongly supported Angela Merckel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear or hear about this.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the duty, was kept in a text approved by a majority of eight-year-olds on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the allocation of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached by an agreement in June during the EU hectic summit, is concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the bench in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed the lavina in French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who has survived as the only one of the eight-member groups affected.
Previous media reports indicated it was about Poland.
A 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with serious injury to her legs.
The dead were mostly 40-year-olds according to the AFP.
“The rescue event ended, as well as the victims’ bodies were taken to identify Briancon,” specified Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
Unfortunately, it happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the top of Mount Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 metres.
“The naked lavina was a wide 250 metres wide and a high mile [50 m],” noted the head of the rescue team Nicolas Colombani.
The eight-member group, according to him, had a huge amount of snow at about 3900 metres.
Meteorological service has not been in the area of non-intervention today.
Trpišovský before the game with Bragou: Finally true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, at his premiere in cups, managed to go through the preschool of the European League to the main group and now he is looking forward to enjoying true Europe with the team.
Sloven to launch the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Brag and wants to force her game style according to the coach.
After all the nerve in the extortional fear, when every goal, and every situation could turn you on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're playing six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every incassed goal, we can play our tactics and we're not just bound by a double.
“I am looking forward to it, and it is true Europe, before that it was only a qualification,” said Trpišovský at the press conference.
Brag thinks it's a top team.
It will be very active, they themselves have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good for the ball.
The player may be harder than that, but he's got a player in his corner who's been giving three goals.
\"It's a great whole of top teams,\" Trpišovský said.
But Brag doesn't consider it clear.
I take it we're playing at home, so I'm sure we're not the outsiders.
“I think we have also shown in the home competition and in the kindergartens that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that,” said the coach whose team lost from eleven duls this season only the opening Superpohár in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can also force Braze into its style.
We're going to have a team that's going to be strong on the ball, at the same time he's not typical for them.
They're playing with a 4-4-2 breakup with a quick transition to the attack phase.
“He is a very heavy opponent, although we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field,” said Trpišovský.
In the kindergartens we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to training.
“And we certainly want it to be very difficult to play according to our notes,” added the coach.
Students take over Sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works to the competition of the 15th International School of Student Films in Písek this year.
The four tens of them, which the commission of students and pedagogists sent to the finale, will be held from 15 to 18 October in Portyč.
The best of them will choose an international jury, said the spokesperson of the festival Jakub Charvat.
Every year, the festival has its special theme that comes from festival sounds.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's celebration evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
- And of course, we also need to solve the crime committed in this year's demand,” said Charvat.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting student production - film playful, animated and documentary.
It will be valued by an international jury, for example the winner of the previous year, the director of Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers are preparing an accompanying program every year.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on Diddgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, trbošanson group Let us fly?, play band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will receive the graduate of the film school and the holder of prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jan Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring about an atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
The German film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the sandy native Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the Ateliére of Jan Novotný's statue will be baptized by his new book of 3 friends from the town of P.
This year we also forget Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of the FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will continue to live.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences and develop joint links and film crafts,” said the spokesperson.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, attend several job auditions at the same time and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of Private Higher Schools of Films in Písek.
Her founders, married Vladan and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
The sixth year was once in two years.
When the CK falls, insurance companies are to pay their clients' claims in full.
Insurance companies should be entitled to customers when the travel agency falls fully.
She decided on it in the centre of the House when she approved a revised amendment to the Act on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy by a bank guarantee according to the pre-positions which aim to assess the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay clients' claims and on the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on local adaptation, arguing that the consumer is protected.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel insurance against cows when the amendment is paid.
But the proposal also criticizes travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll have to either end up or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development of Karl Šlecht (ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full refund are not euroform.
She warned this year of the decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client was entitled to a full refund, irrespective of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, stressed Šlechtová.
\"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be made,\" TOP Vice-President 09 Miroslav Kalousek said.
The bank guarantee he thinks will not work because no one will miss her.
“Case offices will have to stop or move their activities abroad,” warned Kalousek.
The member of the Presidency of the Association of Czech Travel Agencys and the agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalousko's concerns on the basis of a survey between the CK Member States did not agree.
“Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies,” he said.
The claim of the insurance undertaking does not constitute Okamura as relevant, any their official written expression in that sense.
They say that the travel agencies will be involved, which according to Okamury, is not a problem.
In advance of the provision, Jan Fischerová (ODS), which referred to the opinion of the competition association of travel agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke of the lubrication of the stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Travel agencies according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” Judge Fischer.
Her proposal to release the disputed passions of the House did not approve.
Nor did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) go with the proposal to return the proposal to the Committee for alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Mr Filip pointed out that travel agencies which, according to him, could threaten consumers.
In view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, Martin Berdych (ANO) has withdrawn her proposal to limit the liability of insurance undertakings in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum four million insurance limit for travel agents offering air transport tours and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales sales of tours.
However, the limit on insurance performance will have to be such that, in the event of an accident, the travel agency will cover all customer claims.
Norma also provides that travel agencies will have to reintroduce at the guided tours that the travel agency organizes.
Travel agencies will have to submit insurance prior to the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, information on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee shall also count on further regular information of insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with information about the number of passengers and tourers sold each month, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of the deposit and the cost of the trip and the vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that a travel agency has not complied with any legal obligations against an insurance undertaking, it shall invite it, in accordance with the forecast to remedy or be able to prohibit a new contract if a breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of the customer.
Novela also has a newly adjusted funding for mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the grant of the mountain service on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan for expenditure and a view of the next two years.
According to the law editor's association, he didn't think what would happen if the insurance company shuts out the CK contract.
That won't mix the tour, and the clients who bought the tour before the insurance went out, so they'll lose it by the association.
In such a case, CK will suffer significant loss and may also break, even though its management was in good condition.
One of the ways travel agencies can cope with such situations will be an action for compensation.
Another option will be to leave abroad and use many softer conditions abroad and then in our market we will act only as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Jan Papez Association.
Although the amendment also includes the banking guarantee institution, it is not thought that it can be implemented in practice at all, as the bank guarantee cannot sound at an unlimited amount.
Moreover, the association considers that the change in current practice of de facto unnecessary.
In the two-year horizon, the new EU directive will need to redistribute the entire law.
There are now 942 active insured travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CCs ended their activities.
Local travel agents will sell annual tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion.
Merchel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be committed to improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of runners to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merckel following negotiations with the German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, she again called for the allocation of refugees who have arrived in the EU among the eight-year-olds.
We need to help countries where refugees are leaving, or when they leave their country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are laying down the dignity conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which more financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations would be possible.
The countries also support the German Government to promote fair distribution of the scales of the refugee crisis on the European country,\" said Merchelová.
The Earth Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke in this context said that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The allocation of runners in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke to speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to begin with the integration of foreigners faster, said the British Prime Minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that the majority of the money Germany spends on the care of the runners serve to integrate those who have a chance to get asylum.
There will be a need for more teachers to handle the German refugees.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners are able to integrate, they can benefit us, he said.
Matt Damon's got the diversity in the movie
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmer Effie Brown during the debate on the division with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO, Greenlight interrupted the actor in the Brown series when stressing the need for alternative views about the black protagonists in the script.
“When we are talking about diversity, you are doing this by taking a film and not at the show’s seat,” Damon says.
Shocked, reacted to the deterioration of Brown with distrust and sighed -Hoo! Wow. Okay, when the comments about Martian were made to broadcast.
Damon and Brown joined together with a common well-known producer Ben Affleck and brothers Farrelly to discuss finalists' shows.
\"I'd like to appeal to people to think about whether the director is anyone who acts as Harmony,\" said Brown at the beginning.
The only black character that's a hooker that is packing a white belt.
The producer of the Drahé White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon cut off that their regime - so that eventually she could give us something we don't want -
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded in a non-compliance with Damon's commentary.
MrPooni’s Twitter user expressed anger on writing a clip, “Mattt Damon jumped into the language of a single black man in the room so that he can explain to her that the diversity is TAK BÍLÁ, that it is as much as it hurts”
Tweet has won more than 5000 retweets and 4000 foxes since he was published.
Damon's comment comes at the moment when the exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After killing young Michael Brown, a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took a national effect and pushed the law and authority creators to refrain from discriminating anti-colored practices.
In February, the singer Prince used to make noises while he was showing nominees in the category of Album of the year during Grammy's price transfer.
“Albas are still important,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as an hated group.
“Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love,” said the leader.
Damon has recently been reported on the list of entertainers, producers and media mouls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether the invitation has been accepted, or has already met with the Pope, it is not clear.

He's glad to have achieved what he's done.

Geoff said to me: “If there was anyone who could have defeated me, I am glad it was Isaac--
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.

The Detroit tigers just passed past Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season was not just a walk through a pink garden for tigers from Detroit.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is currently in the last place of the Central Division of America's League.
Just turned the Tigers away when they defeated Minessot in the Tuesday game with a tight result of 5-4 at Target Field Stadium.
The twins have wasted their chance to approach the Houston Astros team and hold the second wild card in the American League.
Even though it was only one night for Detroit, it was a return of words to Z, which was so inadvertent to them during the second half of the season.
“The win is always fun and it does not matter how,” said the manager of Tiger Brad Ausmus.
Alfredo Simon's tiger pitcher maintained his offensive launch and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another one in the sixth and ninth shift.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponents 6 1/3 of the fire and 3 both.
It was his only third lead game from the last nine games.
“This year I want to end up with convincing results,” said Simon.
“It’s hard to live in a game when you often sit on the bench and that’s why I want to get properly into the game -
The Tygrów envelope Victor Martinez got hit three times and made two rounds and his first download point from mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last June game, in which he got hit four times in a fight against Seattle Mariners.
“He had a good fight, ” said Ausmus.
“He looked good at the training, he set fire markedly better, and he managed to move it into the game.
Thanks to the three circulations at the end of the seventh shift, Twins got the greatest chance to go back to the game.
The Middle Pole Byron Buxton won a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The right polarist Aaron Hicks got a point thanks to the set bat and Simon spooked Brian Dozier before he replaced Blaine Hardy's left.
Hardy shut down his only opponent Maurar and had before him a Miguel San bat who set off a ball and ran two meters and left behind Drew VerHagen's right hand.
With two players on the finishes and chances on the tie in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third base over two meters.
Plouffe has already gained 27 circulation over two meters in this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit has held the ninth shift, Mauer has two downloaded points, and Bruce Rondon has secured score 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this right hand has disabled San at three disadvantages.
Detroit took advantage of the advantage and won points when playing Phil Hughes.
Tigers gained three shoes in the first two shifts against a earned rightman who entered the game after more than a month's break due to the inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly did not imagine such a start,” he said Hughes, “but during the third shift I felt that I was better off throwing things into my mind.
After he resisted the force in the first shift, Hughes left one point in the second point to Ian Kinsler's metas.
Two exits for J.D. Martinez's right field were taken out by Victor Martinez, who first passed all the finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
The third metator Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another course, but Victor Martinez was moved when he tried to pull on the third base.
The tigers added in the second shift when their pitcher James McCann and the archer Anthony Gose got two and each one point, and the score of 3-0 on the resulting board was on the score.

Hughes passed three meters, won six launches and four strikees.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right pitcher of the Tigers, ended the match with pain in the right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews will take care of him, who operated Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been injured on the list because of his muscles in his shoulder from mid-August, should be in the middle game.
Sanchez will replace Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and come against the Doubles.
Since June 30th, when Norris was replaced by David Price's left pitcher, he has 1-1 score after 4 matches.
But since August 20, he hasn't played because of his muscle being pulled.

Xi calls for the opening of the economy into the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to strengthen growth, said President Xi Jinping Group, whose task is to reform the external governance.
“Member States should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies,” said the Central Head of the Group on the 16th meeting for deepening the overall reform.
Propagation of opening up during birth reforms will be added to new impulses and vitality, and will also provide a new area for economic growth, Xi states.
The Head of the Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the release of border controls policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganise the registration residence system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up in which sectors and enterprises which are outside the limits for investment are identified.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, the provision of a legal business environment and make the market more open, states a statement.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and will ensure that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new regional growth support mechanisms.
In an effort to open a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
‘The government will not change its foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of companies financed from abroad and will provide them with better services,’ says the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for a foreigner to request authorisation for a permanent stay or a ‘green card’, thanks to the optimisation of requirements and simplification of the application process.
The guarantee of lawyers' rights to practice and develop a professional judge and the prosecutor has also been discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and representatives of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to the statement issued after the meeting.
A new bed department may be created in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the Karlovy Vary Region, the current capacity of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of each hospital.
In the region, however, there are possibilities for extending care.
For example, at the surgical department department, a centre of day-to-day surgery could be created, where, according to the planned concept, surgery operations that do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals would focus on day-to-day surgery, it is not clear yet.
In Karlovy Vary's skin department, a laser center could again be created with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the formation of an apalal centre that would care for patients with brain disability who are in a vegetarian state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological and resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility to concentrate such facilities into the hospital of Ostrov, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, is the bed of subsequent care, especially the bed of Léčeben long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdku is insufficient and should, above all, be closely connected to the bed of acute care.
Part of this facility should work as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends a concept.
As pointed out, the beds of subsequent care lack mainly in the hospital of Karlovy Vary.
That's where you could use the abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary Region, social health beds are presented with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are in shortage throughout the Republic, so it could serve for other countries as so called Alzheimer's center.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called related beds to be released by European subsidies.
“One bed that will link to the range of unspecified care and will create room for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiochirrgic, neurosurgical, transplant or other surgery,” describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
