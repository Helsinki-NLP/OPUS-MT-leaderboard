Civil Rights Movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefit of Colored People (NAACP) published a warning for the colored people of the passengers to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
‘The NACP’s most important recommendation to the State of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls for African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to take greater attention when travelling across the state as a result of the series of racially motivated incidents currently taking place in the State, is in the declaration of association.
NACP stated that this step had been taken on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri which make it easier for the defence of racistly motivated acts before the Court, as well as the conduct of the institutions acting in criminal proceedings which are disproportionately aimed at minorities.
\"There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police only because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed,” said Kansas City Star President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
“We are proud to have the biggest complaints we have yet to complain about.
This is the first warning of its kind, which the organization has issued for the United States.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated assaults directed towards students of black skins at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, men of black skins from Tennessee.
Sanders died in a dispute this year after he was traveling across the state by gas, and the police put him in custody without a crime charge.
The travel advice also draws attention to the recent declaration of the highest state representative of the State of Missouri, which states that black skin drivers have a 75% higher chance to stop them.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers against what might happen in Missouri,” said Chapel.
‘The people must be prepared - they should carry the money with them for the payment of bail, or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the State -
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme, the reports of hate crime took place in Missouri in 2015 with hundreds of cases of hate conduct, which results in a state of 16th place among all states.
Travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri Act, which makes it difficult to sue for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States approved the immigration law that allows state-owned agents to hold people on the basis of a violation of this law, which, according to ACLU, is expected to improve racial profiling.
The travel advice is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently the advocacy groups have agreed to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family doesn't have any peace after 12 years!
The murder is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
The girl originally from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by the chef Mark Dixie directly at the restaurant she worked in, and he planted stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex together and smoke marijuana, and then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a careful criminal work to cover the crime scene.
Dixie, the former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to the release of freedom of 34 years for the murder and rape of models Sally.
The one in court admitted only to assaulting minors and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead to lie on the street.
After three years, the police testified him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting for the fate of the night.
The killer said: “He was really upset and after his attack the girl began to scream--
The taxi driver, in total, attracted attention, - claimed lying.
A girl, according to his statement, was supposed to defend herself, which she could, of course, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved to be a lie and accused of him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his tightness and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to burn a marijuana.
Before Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, he told the police Dexie himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started yelling for help, and therefore attacked her from behind and put her hand over her mouth,” she added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family is facing other attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people on the loose who dig these graves.
\"So our daughter is no longer there,\" said the Mirror Mother of the deceased girl Linda about the disappearance of the urnny with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrator also costs tens of thousands.
“The Czechs are not prude or conservative,” says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague Intimity boutique.
It includes design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mares.
It started out inconceivable, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycle trip after Moravia.
One of them did not only bring a bike, but also a box full of unseen vibrators.
- Different moles and dolphins and all of it was green and yellow and just completely different, - it tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with the German producer of design erotic aid Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help with marketing.
When his partner left so he could take care of another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he operates in Prague's Benedict Street butik Intimity, where he sells erotic aids in ways that are normally offered luxury purses or shoes.
Why wouldn't he?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, do you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such a punk!
The Berlin trade Fun Factory, designed by the recognized designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the boutique of Intimity.
They opened it in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, deceivable style, products more than in perfume.
Martin and his business partner, Zdenek Šebelka, began to consider how to take the Prague trade where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimity liked both.
“It is intimately related, and it is also, it can be said tender,” he says.
It followed the purchase of the internet domain and the search for an appropriate space that was parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, she won a variant that spreads the shop into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom with a walk of bed.
Dagmar Štěpánová from FormaFal's studio prepared it.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem completely perfect because he wasn't on the main street, but he was back in the name of Intimity.
He's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no one's testing customers, - praises Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first one.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with brandy nice goods, in a environment where women, mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a store.
When I walked into the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the streets of the wasteland.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the erotic business.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior that I knew from fashion bouquets.
Even if there's only a woman in the shop to ask for help, it doesn't mean that a man's foot wouldn't come in here.
Some of the gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
“You can usually not estimate the right size and choose more,” Martin smiles over often error.
These are the prejudices, the gloomy, that women need some big aid, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith would like to choose an unnecessary big vibrator.
In the same way, men choose mostly black underwear, while a woman usually tends to be more of a pink color.
The absolute best seller is currently a product called Satisphyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don't know who beats because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a painless clitor.
Pere has an adolescent need for me to take pleasure in the way the interpretation is given to me.
It's like they're not missing.
And it doesn't actually go well.
It's at a good price and has perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well accepted.
It's like the last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care of the fact that women started to be more interested in the design of such products.
The other was a vibrator for a couple of We-Vibe.
He completely demolished a taboo that can persist in some men, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
“There are different variants,” he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
With love connection, a woman can have a vibration in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, there is a certain fall in the category of loading vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they need to be used only externally.
At the same time, in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it's a little different.
The question is what to offer men, Martin considers.
We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent - most often sold mainly by the massurbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like anatomic vagina imitation, but you sleep as a shower gel or as an egg or futuristic object.
It concentrates a lot on functionality and experiences when you use it.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It's making me wonder.
I thought Japanese would suffer a lot on erotic aid, I'd say.
- That's the Internet reality, - it's explained to me.
The whole thing is completely different.
In Europe, erotic aids are more linked to women being used.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, the women's taboo - just for the interesting - what the Japanese Tenga brand, which is represented in the Intimity book, sells worldwide, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and Czechs are no prude.
On the contrary, we're a nation of honor.
Definitely unlike the countries such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client moves between 35 and 50 years and, however, has a certain experience with sexual life, but with some aids.
She will come for something nicer, more comfortable, to fill her partner life, or to herself - to return, Martin Ráž and her business partner Zdenek Šebelka are trying to convince each product to function perfectly.
We also don't want to get into a type of bondage and latex special, because we don't have space for that, but it's not gonna happen here.
Such things might reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which is people who've always had shame in having to go to the sex shop because they were afraid they'd come up with something like that.
Many of the products on the cheeks really kiss them.
It is also given by a selection of renowned brands.
Some of them even won design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever appreciated was the mentioned marine horse - and it triggered a change in the entire sector.
It began to move from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with healthy unsatisfied, to produce other designs, different colors...
The pleasure is that some are behind the design of some, while Anna Maresh's popular designer is behind them.
I have to say, I'm kind of surprised how many people have the design stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Maresh, even though they're relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus's balls from Anna Mares.
She did a really huge job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nice, with the story.
Ann's story started as a school job.
Now it's a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not a great deal, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
I may go a little against the current, but it seems important to keep us in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything,” describes Anna’s situation later, which agrees with Martin that our society is more and more open.
He does not meet with negative or repulsive attitude.
They say people are gonna get angry.
“But even you will start smiling,” Anna Maresh currently has a vibrator in her offer, which you can make a personal message, and this year he also plans his own lubricant gel.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other news should be added.
Ginger of Healthy Sex
I'm interested in where he lies the border of what's fine.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's really hard to define.
What happens to one person may seem completely abnormal, so we're more likely to define a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them go into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the most crazy demand they got?
Right now, an e-mail came in the week that some lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural nature of 20 inches long.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like this.
The question is, if any of us were not kidding, Martin takes a suspicious look at me.
And that happens from time to time...
Karl Gott's wound.
Two cancers of Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štědný is fighting serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that steals people's memories.
“Yes, unfortunately, it is true,” confirmed the sad info of Lightning himself as a singer.
I know about my illness, and so far I'm handling it pretty well with regard to circumstances.
“I am taking medicines that are supposed to slow the disease,” he added that he thanked him for his support.
The whole diverse family came here to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to be home as far as possible, and his father's home on White Hora comes also from his first marriage to Zuzana and Tereza, the son of Karel spoken to Karel Karel.
The generous twice fought cancer and gave his experience to Slavík to support him during his demanding treatment.
He's got 60 chemotherapy.
He was able to return to work on the tennis court and ski slopes.
\"From astrologer, I have been foretold to be here by 90,\" said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
“I keep putting words on my mind so I don’t forget them,” Karel admitted.
With the same disease, she's already fighting at the Institute and actress Květa Fialová.
Do you have a patient in your family with Alzheimer's?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilian Parliament has cancelled the ban on interference, the law will judge the US.
In Chile, an absolute ban on artificial pregnancy must therefore not be implemented for health reasons.
“I am sorry that the legislators filed a complaint against the Constitutional Court and that there will now be ten people to decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years,” said Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should get a new President who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition by the end of August.
The law canceling the absolute ban on interference, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would be assaulted in court because she thought it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
The Members of the vote on the draft law last month have withdrawn until the Joint Parliamentary Commission has analysed it.
At the centre of the Members, the proposal was approved and the Senate made it again.
According to the new legislative arrangements, a criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy should be stopped in three cases: if a woman is at risk of being killed if the child does not have a chance of survival, or if pregnancy comes from rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, i.e. before women got the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on interference in 1989 introduced the legal dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world with an absolute ban on interference.
Other are Nicoragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30-year-old prison sentences for the interruption of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, there was spontaneous abortion, which the court referred to as murder.
Is there anything sacred yet?
The territory of Trump's White House is now Socha Freedom
An insignificant sign of change of mode is the critic of statues.
Americans could talk about it just as well as everyone else - see carefully staged decommissioning of Saddam Husajn's statues on the Prague Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what was coming down to when he was having a passionate debate with the reporter CNN Jim Acosto on the subject of President's proposals for the drastic limitations of legal immigrants went out with a symbolic axe on the Soch Freedom.
It's good to say that Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
For that, the crowd of owners of cruise ships and imitators of Sochy Svoboda would drain him.
However, he attacked its importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 the poster was placed on the foundation with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller said to Acostus: “I don’t want to go into history here, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom, which brings light to the world.
The poem that has been placed on the foundation is not part of it, and to which you refer,
Miller's real right, but as he said himself, it's not about history.
This is especially about the surprising words of Emma Lazarus, which are resonating today - they are not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: “Let me be the ones who have fallen, who are barely able to breathe freely, who is a poor worm in the midst of cities -
And in modern times, we can be better than ever to watch these “black worms, ” in our paintings.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people weren't welcome in the United States.
This conflict about the importance of sculpture is part of a massive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about America's importance.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to put the posters with poems on the base of the statue, knew quite well that they were letting themselves into a high political game.
The statue was supposed to express the connection of the French and American Republican government by representing the classic theme, i.e. women's embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem a woman is not an abstract figure, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of Extortions.
A bonding poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And the same way Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing expert has long been trying to reverse this meaning.
The well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan Krzybít in the matter of Trump’s taking power - in 2010 argued that Socha Svoboda actually does not invite anyone to the ground, but represents an early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the world: “The Peace of Freedom goes forward.
It's taking out a march of freedom from the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
It is not intended to illuminate the way to the United States -
Limbaugh's getting into an important thing.
The importance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the sight of a exhausted and bloody passenger who, many times after a long and scary cruise across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart of a new country.
This is literally about the view of the world of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view there is a statue of hope and listens to their needs.
And this is, of course, a perspective that Miller and Trump do not know.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to promote hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship in the athletes 2017: Neil Black is praised on the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members
The head of the Attletic Federation of the United Kingdom of Neil Black said that the 16 Scottish Sclerosis in the World Championship will be “a major contribution to the team”
For MS in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that “there is something strange happening in Scotland - and British athletes could learn from Scotland.
“We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it,” said Black.
“I was talking to people from the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it had something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletes: they have what they've done.
People in the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing -
Several Scottish athletes will strive for a medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in a race of 5000 m while Eilidh Doyle was elected as captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing,” said Black.
“Some athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came out of a room with a feeling of great pride and motivation.
The passion and the indiscriminate feelings that Emilidh spoke to were unrepeatable.
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the run over obstacles to 400 m on her fifth World Championship, stated that it was “unbelievable - that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
For the last year only five British and two European records have been set by a runner on Muir's medium line.
The MS will take part in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scotlands is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track at 1500 m. This season won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team captain said that she was “very proud of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues had come to the team, but in many cases they will also attack their participation in the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary on the team captain’s post is that I was elected by other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members to be pleased about it,” she added.
“I’m very proud of all the skits that got to the team.
It proves where I went when I moved.
They're athletes who'll think about the front positions on the stage.
And my initial speech?
Yes, I think she did it.
I just pointed out that we could be proud of this year's championship because it's taking place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'll enjoy an amazing atmosphere.
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not miss out on a public function unless you bear the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the papers didn't last long to criticize him for anything, starting with a local politician and ending his political views.
Yes, this critic didn't let him get cold.
But he wasn't trying to shut himself up.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “The freedom of expression can be taken away from us - and the stupid ones and we will be led as sheep in defeat. ”
This brings me to Maryland is the governor of Larry Hogan who needs to work on how he can act as Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted contributions to at least 450 people who freely showed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The governor’s staff rejected the action as unfounded, and many views of the type “who cares about it” appeared in the comments on the Internet.
“It’s only Facebook,” said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially at the moment when it comes to people like Hogan.
This is an extremely popular Republican governor in an absolutely democratic state.
He may boast of the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not populative.
As you can see, the state manages its own confidence and strictly respects its principles.
It turned out that it is also visible in the use of Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters - except for the first photograph with a naked head after the adoption of chemotherapy.
The blocking of people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid by taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and, ultimately, dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor with the fact that blocking comments took place from the position of modifying contributions.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spamers or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post has contacted several real people who have been deleted from contributions.
And that's exactly what they are-- real people who talk to their elected leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not violent.
In his comments, Pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The attorney of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramaniová, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hated.
“I was polite to note that I was disappointed in his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other current reports,” wrote Washington Post in the section commentary.
“I do not like to think that once a number of people commenting on the same subject, some people are marked as promotion of so-called collective efforts instead of being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens.
What the governor’s staff called “a concentrated spam interest, probably the others would call“a defense. ”
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It's much more convenient than in the past when the same procedure would require the second sending of employees to the street where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism or arrest or silence protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor to be criticized for the shame of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing an action against Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudun County Board of Supervisors violated the first addition in Alexandria, according to the district judge James C. Cacheris, where she prevented the access of one of the voters to her Facebook page.
The Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's times, the low price of the post office had the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press was numbered and his position was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those times Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms as “Juricola, ” “Valerius, ” “Belisarius, ” and “Portius, wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people in the framework of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions, criticising his opinion on the agreement of Treata of Amita, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain, gathered in his office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lie on the very foundations of our nation.
And a true leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, abroad use more data than at home.
In the Czech Republic, they use more of their tariff than at home.
The most common is in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is Croatia.
On vacation, however, they have more time to pluddle on the web, but they usually do not have the opportunity to join the Wi-Fi under the sun.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in your hand.
So it looks typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of those operators at home prices.
It's coming out of O2's fresh statistics.
Thanks to its new roaming rules, the majority of Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the paušál than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where a minimum of our soldiers ride through winter, data consumption has increased even fifty times this summer season.
Italy was placed in the second place in the data ladder.
Most of the minutes the Czechs are calling from Germany, where many go from work and during the years.
Croatia, according to the data of the Association of Czech travel agencies, will visit 800 000 Czechs annually, so our most popular holiday destination is our most popular holiday destination.
People here have, however, exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was this July 7th.
“For the data transmitted, tens of millions of photos would be included,” specified the details of the head of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
While Croatia is in the data volume, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
In the first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to the fourth and Italy sixth.
To Austria, we are heading for hiking and active holidays for which we do not have so much time to ply on the Internet.
“In addition to Austria, Czechs are heading towards Jadran,” explained Cieslar.
While the data was recorded by the operator following the release of roaming charges for high annual growth, it is much lower for phone calls.
The number of minutes released in roaming increased from last year to double.
Germany dominates with a huge head start in front of other countries.
“Roading is more likely to be used by corporate customers on business routes,” Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes at home's atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping in the cool atmosphere of Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th year Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who came from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finale according to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of the Ambassador of the tournament in the representation of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament shows the world of its beauty,” said Rafferty.
“The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands -
The English Eagles will first defend the master title, despite the victory of European Tour and European Challenge Tour during its 32-year careers.
“I have a good feeling about it,” said the southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the earth is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year, when Sharon and I were winning a very great deal.
It was a beautiful time I would not forget.
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from this year’s country, returned to the home land.
This event will be its first participation since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“I always like to play homeland,” Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want to be successful while you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result that I have achieved.
The three players will also join the former Masters Ian Woosnam and the winner of the Senior Tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Included in the tournament is free. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to the Prostate Cancer UK.
Poor and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Badin Degei cooks dinner, he doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a manor.
In its wooden cottage located in the capital of Madame Enarotali in Papua Indonesian province, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the words of local “nota” - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, we take out the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina is sitting on a mud country - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where it is also doing its daily work, such as washing laundry in turbulent water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof has a toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned a field to work.
Polygamy is common here.
Work in late nights poses danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, there are soldiers in the village.
“In the afternoon after 5:00 a.m., no one will ever be lurking around the village,” says Badan.
It is a rare view of everyday life in the vacuum of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public appeal before the occupation army.
The current movement of protesters against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakartian government, which controlled the whole region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights overseers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and deserted city, where you can get from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire after you reach the 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach passing ride.
Right to the right in this place is not working.
The city with 12,000 inhabitants consists of wooden cottages covered with bamboo fences, roofs of wave sheets in shades of grey and rusty colours.
Very few Indonesians looked at this place, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival, local Christians worshiped God named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We were not used to wearing these clothes,” says Bardina, pointing to our colorful handmade turban, dark shirt and a bright dress.
“We used to wear leaves only.
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the inhabitants live below the poverty line, and the present child mortality and gravity is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grassberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from America's Pheenix, is only 60 miles from Panama - a rocky province of approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport produced gold and copper worth $1.1 billion.
In addition, Papua promotes the mining of wood at the estimated value of $78 billion.
These wealth, however, are a source of suffering for the Papal people and a guarantee of oppression from the powerful Indonesian army.
From an investigation conducted by New York Times in 2005, it appears that Freeport paid to local military agents and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including the amount of $15,000 for one officer.
Papals who call for self - control threaten this gold goose and are therefore heavily oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papants have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, trained and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murder in the Tribal area of Papua during the 1970s was equal to the genotype, as stated by the Asian Committee on Human Rights.
Only last year has Indonesian police arrested in the region more than 3900 peaceful protestants.
We Will Lose Everything, a report by the British archipelago of 2016, describes the cruelness that occurred last year, as out-of-court executions, torture - according to other reports, is especially popular rape and execution by electric current - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It is difficult to count the number of victims, because there are incidents every week,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation burdened the fact that the papal resources attracted to Indonesia’s colonist.
With 3.5 million inhabitants of this province, 83% are reporting to Christianity, but demography is changing with the tide of Muslim immigrants from Indonesian islands - Javas, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Java canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“The immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papans,” explains the four-year-old Abeth You, born in Panama and moved for work in the capital of Jayapura Province.
“The main inhabitants of Papua - Mom-Momama (men) - so they lost their jobs -
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is called Jokov, promised to deal with the inequality and violations of the law in 2014 as part of his presidential campaign.
The former Emperor secured and his way to the presidential palace in Jakart 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including the Lady.
But it has changed very little in Papua, and local people feel hurt.
“Our heart was broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokpwi’s hope to hear our call for justice,” said You.
The fact is that just two months after the October inauguration of Jake experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers, this extract and the tone that she had touched and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in an undermanned state followed a group of children and beat them with their arms, reported the victims and witnesses to the events.
One of the soldiers then burned down on a group of children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so strongly, he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby building of the electoral commission and the following day things were still going off.
Some 1,000 young papal men and women gathered at the football field outside the local police station and military headquarters and claimed justice.
They came with circumstantial hunting gaps and made dancing vaita - in which they ran in circles and imitated the singing of birds - the papal tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones on the buildings.
With the increasing tension, the order was given to soldiers through the radio: “If the crowd attempt at least three times to resist, you have permission to shoot,” said TIME in an official document, the content of which has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali Kego Koto quarter, identified the dangers and called on the inhabitants to break into their homes.
But no one had a fight on his words.
“ When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” said TIME on the porch of his dog-painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who was the shooter yet, but according to his words, she was a bullet from one of the present soldiers.
“A lot of people have been around, and a lot has been fired,” he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was hit three times by his cousin's words.
“ I went to the body to convince myself that it was really him,” said TIME with a sad voice by Yohanes, who only uses one name as many Indonesians.
“I knew he was dead... I kissed him--
Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told the journalists that his officers only “deserved the station under attack.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to die,” said the press spokesperson of the Papal Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio.
“It’s a matter of life and death. ”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protestors were killed, and many were thrown out of injury.
The report on the murders was on the following day of the Jakart media.
Three weeks later, Joko presented a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' family and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
“I demand immediate solutions to this problem so that he could never repeat himself,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that it would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, but they started calling out excuses.
“ Most violent acts have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them happened in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task,” he said.
In an interview of June 5 for the TIME week, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed not to plan any action in Papua.
Instead of saying that “all cases will be brought before trial, ” he said.
According to more than one thousand dead in 1999's independent elections in East Timor, the UN accused of “manufacturers against humanity,” said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including an incident in Panama.
The families of the shooting victims in Panama welcomed his claims with distrust.
“In the last three years, I have been asked four times, but I have not yet waited,” said Yohanes.
“I’m tired.
As he says, several years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I fear I will be arrested by an army or by someone who shoots me.
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the view of many of the state's inhabitants who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After burying the body, the army began looking for me, ” he said.
And the shooting doesn't stop yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at the villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
There was an attack involving one person and another 17 injured between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24) who drowned in a nearby river fishing died on his way to the hospital.
The villagers protested before the building of society.
According to the police's statement, the villagers were throwing on the corresponding stones and their response was a warning shot.
But the locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indian paramilitarist police) began shooting at the crowd and killing one man.
“There was a panic, we were afraid of payback,” said TIME 29-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
“ I didn’t leave home for two days, ” he said.
The Deiyai Parliament requested the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Lady was always in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papuan Movement for the liberation of Papuan (OPM) - the army of rebels who protect the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Panama, among them the Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kimya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has been arrested and has held freely for thousands of people in the country, all under the presumption of “the provision of national sovereignty. ”
Some of them never see again.
Mseai is known as “the tragic and forgotten place” among Papuan people.
Oil comes in the fire with poverty.
The few rice that sells in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still inconceivable.
Here, the residents grow their food: especially sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
Women work in fields; each of them make four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between the native Papuans and immigrants.
Even so few jobs will usually plant more educated and richer immigrants.
The popes rarely have the necessary capital and education so that they can get into business.
“Young people move from the village due to a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, President of the Lady’s Tribal Council.
Because of isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
This also contributes to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were fired from papaya - because of “the lack of cooperation with the authorities - all despite the fact that they received such a rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jok in his election campaign promised to repeal strict rules for journalists and to achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
“For foreign journalists working in the most extreme areas of Papua and West Papua, they are at great risk: not to recognise visas and to be included in the blacklist,” he stated in the statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in the matter of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “various and extended violent acts - in Papua, including shootings in Panama.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of the Arrmanatha Nasir took out the charges when he declared to journalists in Jakart that: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.
Local people call for participation by foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, at the head of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the local people called on the source that took part in the meeting, but wanted to stay anonymously, the word “we want freedom,”
Another election is scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the papayas say they won't vote for Jokov.
“Jok is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Panama,” said Gobau, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokov to know that the inhabitants of the Lady - except that they live in constant fear of the robbery army - are involved in poverty, poor education and health systems.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Panama, as well as the other popes, consider their voice to be “the debt that Jokom must pay.
“They don’t want money, they demand justice,” he added.
Despite threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Panaian shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of rebellion: they bury the bodies of victims on the property across from police and military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least they will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
“He was killed by a member of our family,” said Yacobus with his head down.
“What can we do?
The French Navy intercepted a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has kept in the Pacific yacht of 1.46 tons of cocaine worth approximately 256 million dollars.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
During the intervention, four members of the ship were arrested, which apparently consists of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
Jachta, named Afalina, sailed from South America and the police dragged her to the port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said that she would work with her international partners to accurately determine where and where drugs were going, and to reveal the ‘litevian Syndicate’ in cooperation with her international partners.
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures to stop a large number of drugs going to Australia,” said its Executive Director Col Blanch.
The roads were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of growing numbers of drug addicts.
The current raid is not the first one recently.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia that tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in senior homes, the solution by the physician from the Geriatric clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavel Mádla could be an infusion of the physiological solution, which are pushing a thin needle under the skin.
But so far, they only apply in medical devices.
The older a person gets, the more water falls in his body.
Moreover, the feeling of thirst is losing, so the seniors generally accept fewer fluids and are very rapidly dehydrated,” Mádlová said.
Two liters should drink for sure.
But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem,” she added.
There are often no physicians in the senior homes.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually managed by infusions.
“I think that there should be gradually introduced to receive subcutaneous infusion,” she said.
By day they can be added to up to two semi-litres of the physiological solution.
The lack of fluid may cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is manifested as a total loss of self-sufficiency.
“One day, the old man will say that he can’t get out of bed, talking confused,” she added.
In case of neglect, it may result in brain events.
Blood is going to get worse and cut blood in the brain, and there's also a risk of renal failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a furnace, a maximum cotton sheets.
One-off diapers may also be a problem.
“It’s more nursely difficult, but it would be ideal for the patient to discover and let the skin grow up,” said the doctor.
In Dubai, it was the second time the skycraper The Torch
In Dubai on Friday, he was found in flames one of the largest residential marbles of the world. Firemen had to evacuate all the inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 floors of buildings.
In the last two years it is already the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the corresponding name The Torch (Security).
Evacuated all the inhabitants of the building and there were no injuries, the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and woke us up an alarm. We heard screams.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the marble.
The Dubai Civil Defense stated that firefighters managed to get fire under control around the fourth hour morning (0:00 GMT), which continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they provide spare accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could once again open a debate on the safety of materials used to cover height buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which initiated the management of the Torch marble after the fire in 2015, appeared to have been most damaged by the lining and external panels used for decoration or isolation.
The British police said that the isolation and lining system of the Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the June fire, where almost 80 people were killed.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of five passengers to the United States are carrying out prohibited items on board an aircraft
The survey between passengers has shown that more than 20 percent of them have been carried out knowingly or knowingly prohibited objects through the control post of the US government agency Transport Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers have entered on board an aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have found that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosive.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and which responded to more than 1000 questions - it appeared that there was more likely to be a breach of the rules in younger passengers.
From respondents who admitted that they tried to travel consciously with an object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with a few thousand hours charged compared to less than 15 percent of the Geneva X members.
Among the most common items that have avoided the attention of the TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents were aware of the sharp object, while 2.2 percent of the women concerned and 3.7 percent of the men concerned also admitted that they had deliberately carried out on board the aircraft prohibited drugs.
The company stated that she carried out research among passengers around the world to determine how many of them were accidentally carried out by unauthorized objects through airport control and how much had done so on purpose.
It is no surprise that the majority of people who have carried the unauthorized items - whether conscious or unconscious - travel by plane very often.
As the company stressed, the TSAs are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and what amount they can carry on a plane.
It is therefore no surprise that TSA has seized in the largest quantity of just prohibited fluids.
At some point, people thought TSA was going to deal with books the same way as with smuggled goods.
The flow of fluid is allowed within domestic flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned directives to reduce the emissions of Obama administration
After 15 states have been sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Head of Scott Pruitt dismissed his previous decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes in the framework of his plan and reacts so much more closely than previous governments for the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal against his previous position in a federal appealing court.
This is the last deadline that was set for 1 October when States should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the agreement would postpone one year and establish a more detailed study of the plan to avoid ‘the relations with local decisions or the risk of economic growth’.
Pruitt, who had held President Donald Trump's position as state attorney for Oklahoma before taking up the role of Head of EPA, served for a long time as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly moved or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden mid-term turnover is the greatest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that an EPA contractor exceeded his authority in order to postpone the inclusion of Obama's administration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In its statement published on Wednesday evening Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards in the given time frame.
“For the government of the previous EPA administration, she often didn’t fill the terms and conditions and waited for her to be sued by activists and others, agreeing with the settlement and other setting of plans,” Pruitt said, who had put more than a dozen complaints in his previous position on EPA.
“We do not believe in the regulation by means of legal proceedings and take the deadline seriously.
We never apply to our statutes and authority, which results from it -
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may use ‘the possibility of delay and all other legally accessible authority’ to ensure that the regulation ‘will be based on health policy and the most accessible information’
The Republicans at the congress are pushing for a more extensive revision of the ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measures have not yet passed through the Senate.
The New York Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who stood at the head of the Coalition of States who sued this week, said that the group was not willing to allow in law enforcement.
“Regarding in EPA - following our judicial over - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million non-EUs and more than 115 million Americans, directly affected by air pollution,” added Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone occurs when common harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
The advocates of public health and environmentalists have a sudden change in Pruitt's life.
“It is worrying what pressure must be developed to change the thought of responsible persons and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of Centra biological diversity.
“We must continue to fight with the ideologies of Trump’s administration, which seeks to help inviolents and special interests.
He's a man of acid, yet he's not dangerous according to court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing at each other, and you suddenly change your whole life from scratch.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andrea Christopher from Great Britain, whose face was blinded by an unknown attacker’s acid, which was finally released by guilt.
Reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christophers'.
Andreas said he was going to open.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man he never saw in his life, immediately after he opened the door without warning, swallowed with acid, saying: ‘This is for you, my friend--
The pain was indescribable.
The dressing fell on me like nothing, and I felt just an unreal pain on my skin,\" Andreas said.
The family quickly delivered him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned a terrible message - according to the doctors, he did not have a chance to survive.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would be responsible for the infection that threatened to penetrate into his wound.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent were affected by the face that the doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A great complication for Christopheros has become a loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most violent thing I've ever experienced.
“You cannot hide from an unexpected light, you cannot close your eyes,” he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has 12 operations behind them, which are far from the last.
Injury victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical treatments and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after challenging and long-term treatment, tissue victims have been scarred for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people will not recover, and have been fighting against deformation and abuse throughout their lives,” said Professor Peter Dwulski, spokesperson of the British association of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
Attacker's wrong.
As for the attack, Christophers is sure that an unknown man had to hang out with someone.
He believed that he was a man who sexually abused his near person.
The police have properly examined the case and the attacker has lost the case.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict on Christopher’s family’s wonder changed significantly.
“Those judges finally concluded that the punishment should be cancelled, since a man is not considered to be a threat to the public,” Christopher said.
In the last few years, the number of assaults has increased considerably.
The Ministry of Interior has expressed its view on the issue that it plans to establish new guidelines for the state’s representatives on the classification of beet.
You should be included in dangerous weapons.
However, sacrifices of similar attacks do not fail to give up.
They demand that the UK Government promote more stringent and longer sentences to remove freedom of people who attack their surroundings with acid or other thirsty substances.
They also require strict control of sales of dangerous substances which are often common to be delivered in different stores, as these are various cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates Dubai burned in the night the famous skycraper The Torch, which belongs to the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dublin Civil Defense, the population of the 80 - year - old building was able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the dubay police spokesperson, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several inhabitants of the house, it was the opposite.
“It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us,” one of the tenants said.
Also according to another tenant whose quote was Reuters, the fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling hot wrecks.
We slept.
The alarm woke us up, people screaming.
“We were going down the stairs, it took us from the 50th floor about ten minutes,” described the events of the tenant George.
Another member of the CNN Witnesses estimated that the flames were captured by about 40 flats.
There were at least two cars destroyed on the ground when they were caught burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defense Communication, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of his creation is not yet known.
According to the Witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the current fell out.
The extensive fire damaged the Dublin skycraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There's about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone because the population managed to evacuate early.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the highest residential building of the world with 352 metres.
The record was prepared immediately next year by another dubay skyscraper.
The cultist had 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in the sample of the 13-year-old Ippolita, a petra collection of illicit drugs was found - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him to the title, it ended fourth.
Now a bodyman is at risk of four years' distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian ragbist David Vasta was positively tested on 11 doping substances, which was until then a record quantity for the increasing athletes.
A three-gauge player started taking steroids a year before he fell through his bodybuilding.
Luck Vondorková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionate about her former lover!
S barely Lucka Vondáčková entered the Czech territory, is in one round.
And he also pays attention to wherever he comes from.
Last time she fell into her arms, her former lover Michal Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and longed for the family.
Lucii was only 19 years old, and she definitely didn't want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went away, but friends stayed still today.
Which was also proven at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
The coincidences have both fallen into blue colors.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michael's pranks when she looked like a belly.
Then they hugged, and the photographers were willing to pose.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, because they will play a milestone couple together in the new Prima Captain Exner series.
The Islamists got lifelong in Britain for the preparation of the Atentate.
The British court sent four members of Islamic cells to life on Thursday, and three Musketeers, according to the D.A., planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
The Czech Republic of men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of such acts, was arrested in August last year.
The authorities then thought they were about to attack immediately.
In the car one of the men, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean “faithless” - and a gun makeup.
It happened the moment the MI5 secret service agent was handing out a listening device into the vehicle.
“The recent attacks have shown what horror the defendants may have caused if they were not stopped,” said Sue Hemming's deputy prosecutor.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after twenty years.
The fourth convicted, 38 years old, can do it after 15 years behind bars.
The men during the London trial claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed by an MI5 agent.
The court also questioned him, but then rejected the defendant's claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38,3 °C on Hodonínsk.
Onward temperature record 37.3 degrees Celsia remained on top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees of Celsia recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodonínsk, he overcame Thursday, which thus became the warmest day this year.
This was confirmed by employees of the Czech hydrometeorology Institute.
On Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records for 35 of 145 meteorological stations were over 30 years old.
On Thursday, record temperatures were recorded only nine long-term measuring stations.
Maybe the Watchtower was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, in Břeclavsk, the quarterly 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths and in Pohorlice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the Watchtower of 2013.
There were ten degrees less in the west.
The high temperatures appeared mainly on the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Watchtower was the largest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojemsk and Brodá nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where the mercury fell well on 37.8 degrees, but the record failed.
On the other hand, for example, in Western and North West Bohemia, according to the ČHMÚ website, the fourth highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsia.
“Teplotypes started to grow there until later this afternoon,” said meteorologists.

Most of Morava's places remain high temperatures on Friday and the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions for visa policy.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without using force resources.
She spends $10 billion annually to support language schools and to build universities abroad, pushes her entertainment industry into foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
That's not gonna happen to Beijing.
There are state media talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force of economic change and modernisation.
Last year, however, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent and about 80 percent of tourists in China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, inter alia, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China is not familiar with its open arms, it assesses the situation in the world's most humanized country, professor of economics from Christopher Balding University in an article for Bloomberg.
An example is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contact with China, citizens of those other countries must order a visa before.
Therefore, there are crowds comparable to the celebrations of China's new year in China.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait a long time in the front, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance has shown that the need for visas reduces the number of visitors in the country by 70 percent.
In 2015, China visited only two million Americans, while Hong Kong, who participated in a gross domestic product of China less than three percent and lives there less than one percent of all the population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem by using the tourism movement to achieve its political objectives, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China reduced transport to South Korea in the context of a break-up around the South Korean anti-racquet system, the South Koreans paid it back, and China were avoiding it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent annually, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to recently published reports from the US central bank Fed, China could leave up to 190 billion dollars as a result of the Chinese foreign routes while China is selling currency to incoming tourists a year.
According to the official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in last year, which is equivalent to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in the trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, the country that is anxiously preventing the spill of capital, is putting a very painful wound.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one more general expression of sustainability towards foreigners.
In many places China has practically heard of immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China.
They have more in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not just a crossroad of immigration, has doubles.
Many scientific work shows that immigrants tend to restore economic growth, business and innovation.
In China, however, you will not practically find them.
It will be politically difficult to solve these problems, but the step offered is to simplify the visa aparate.
Other Asian states, especially India and Vietnam, have recently developed a great effort to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, they reproduced deadly poisons.
The Kingdom of Pilsen can enjoy three rare, deadly, toxic beaches.
In the exposure of visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish people.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 metres.
“Also the meth lengths grow,” says the spokesperson Martin Vobruba.
The men of the other two species, the mortals and the cobras of red, so far they will acquire strength in the breeding garden.
We can't tell you when people will see them yet.
“We would hate to lose them,” said the nurse Miroslav Dohn with the fact that it could take a year or two.
Australia's deaths have come to the world eight, they're descendants of breeding couples originating in the population around Sydney.
“The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals from the area of Pertha,” said Vobrua, saying that in human care, wintering is required for 6-8 weeks for the mortals at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsia.
The ultimate success was accompanied by a dream of African spitting Cobra red.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo came out of four eggs with a total of four youngsters.
“Incubation lasted 65 days, ” added Vobruba.
This species in nature on its victims will spray poison, within a distance of up to four metres.
He's headed for his eyes, he can cause a permanent blindness.
Youths of all three species live in the zoo with mice.
In 40 days in the garden they still expect to kiss the baby out of the dreams of the mother black, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unbelievable letter of telephone interview, Trump is making a pressure on Mexico because of payment behind the border wall
The American daily Washington Post published a copy of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview of 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nitem had his Trump alerted him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
According to American president, he publicly condemns the construction of the wall, saying: “You cannot speak this way in the press.
On his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announce that he would pay Mexico for it.
The public also escaped the transcript of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing the intense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbulls that the US Security Agreement on Refugees to Australia was “screet - and“ stupid - and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama’s Government - would look “hungry - after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the United States.
Trump closed the call after Turnbull explained that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day, ”
Tusk once again spoke to the D.A. about the Smolenko.
The address of the dead president, President of the Government Party of Law and Justice of the PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński, said to Tusko.
“I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not scare me,” said Tusk, and read the country’s current leadership that he was trying to exploit justice against political rivals.
At the departure from the D.A.'s office, he waited for Tusk on TV TV TVN 24 dav, which scandalized Donald Tusk! and wished politics hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: ‘I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not frighten me.’
According to his words, the prosecutors don't question anything, but they don't doubt that justice has the current Polish rulers to serve as an instrument against opponents, oppositions or people who don't like me, and I'm afraid I'm part of this group.
He's been in interrogation for the second time.
The ex-premissor was questioned at the D.A. for the second time, and this time he was asked to question the doubt in the autopsy of the victims of the Smolean disaster.
The bodies in the coffin have come to an additional exchange.
The families were forbidden to open their coffins and there must have been some reasons.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because he would have burdened the Polish-Roman relations.
The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve Donald Tusk to become someone very important in the EU, said Kaczyński on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would freeze Tusk's chances of getting the most important chair in the Union, of which Poland had absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merckel that it could have fallen differently with Donald Tuske, but she did not realize it.
Tusk has submitted an eight-hour interrogation at the D.A. since April 19th.
He didn't even speak as a suspect at the time, just as a witness.
However, many of his calls for questioning were considered to be part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tuska as a political opponent in connection with various scandals.
The prosecutor's office in Poland is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who carries out the role of the Attorney General.
The appeal to the hearing came upon the election of Tuska to the European Council, which Kaczyński tried to prevent, inter alia, from visiting the Merchels in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of the Tuskova mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, he left Varsava on the sticks and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

The massacre on the Moore's Ford bridge: activists remembered racist lynching
Ford Mercure from 1948 passed past the overseeing inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia and the codercal towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four passengers of black skin and a white driver enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns encircled it.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a pruned suit - long pulled out of a cigarette and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside, passengers were shaking with fear.
\"We want n-and Roger,\" said the man.
“ Bring him to me -
The silence will be interrupted by a young black man who's pulled out of the passenger seat.
This scene is fortunately a mere reconstruction of events that occurred on July 22nd.
But when one of the men goes over the “Roger’s neck of the back, the audience will be excited.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford Bridge has been returning regularly to a group of activists who have rebuilt the fate of the night of 1946, when two black and white couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcomová and George and Mae Murray Dorsey were killed by members of Kukluxklan.
No one's been tried for murder yet.
“It is strange that the only person has not been arrested in all these years - although we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,“ he let himself hear Tyrone Brooks, helping to organize the reconstruction of events.
“It’s a stain on our history and burden in our souls, ” he says.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong fighter for civil rights.
In his eyes, it is a reconstruction of the events of a dramatic call to be held. Every year, Monroe reminds us that justice was not done enough.
“We require judicial prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” said Brooks.
‘ Until then, the healing and reconciliation process must not be initiated.
The medical examiner covers on July 27, 1946 one of the bodies of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI records received by NBC News, the lynching was expected to take part in up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
But no one has been tried to prosecute before.
Although suspects remain free for decades, citizens' rights claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, they obtained the first right to participate in the elections scheduled for summer by the Supreme Court of the people of the Black Stocks of Georgia.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the farmer had a black skin of Roger Malcom during the attack stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white skin - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, Brooks thought he was involved with Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, the most important owner of Loy Harrison's white skin land for Malcoma bail of $600.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey in prison.
When she returned from the prison, just before she arrived at the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects had taken their way.
“As it turns out, he planned the murders and organized Harrison,” the FBI brought out.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between the state and local defenders of the law, who were not only involved in lynching, but also removed evidence and kept the identity of the Witnesses.
Brooks expressed himself briefly on the whole matter.
“It was a massacre over the election law,” he said.
“The murders had a clear context for all the locals of the black skin: ‘This is how you will go if you register and go vote’--
The annual reconstruction of events at the Moore's Ford Bridge organizes almost ten years of Cassandra Greene.
Its performance is iconic, obsessive and obsessive, showing a deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider in modern America to be exterminated.
It's not easy to follow this reconstruction and it's even more difficult to reverse sight, but Greene says it has its meaning.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we must face the unpleasant feelings that hide within each of us,” Greene said.
“However, we cannot have a relationship if you do not listen to what I had to go through. ”
The main exams of this year began in June and the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of black - included them in a room where Greene met with a very carefully scheduled performance.
Wade Marbaugh carries out the position of the assistant director.
For many years the leader of Kukluxklan played, but according to his words, the role of exhausting is.
“I have a bad feeling about it because it contradicts who I was,” Marbaugh said.
“I think it is very important to remember this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time.
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcom's role, and Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The presentation begins with a pot - Malcom deals with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
‘Get off my property n--
You can't have Rascon.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every actor of the black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
“What has happened - to ask Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
\"No,\" says Greene's wedding.
“I don’t think the white men said that’s the tone,
“Exactly,“ one of the actors of the black skin will win.
\"You must put greater emphasis on R-
The energy in the room is suddenly better; the hostility replaces the feeling of approach.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors of the scene are repeating.
Rascon this time puts emphasis on the correct expression of the words on N.
No one laughs now.
The introduction ends violently and quickly.
River, gunshots... and the next silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and drinks Billie Holiday’s gloomy song “Strange Fruit”
With every word there is sadness in the room.
On the background of all this, about a dozen of those watching are running out of sweat and tears from their eyes.
In general there are practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple arrived from the New York Ithaca, many overlooking them from the nearby area.
Each one of them is taking the local wet climate for almost eight hours and Brooks leads to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until this moment, it could have been seen murder with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where lynching occurred, the atmosphere is scary.
In the last words, Greene will invite the crowd looking at the body inspection.
The children bow to the heads of the victim, watch fake blood, and the wrong bodies and whisper something in their ear.
“They’re not dead, ” the little boy smothers.
She'll run out for a few minutes and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean up the rope and tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, a man in a suit that played the leader of Kukluxkan.
Nick Rascon will cover two of our friends-herce and cry in their arms; they eventually lay emotions on him.
“It’s okay,” she whispers one of the women.
“We know that the role is coming to you.
But you had a reason for--
Later that day, he sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski hardly found words to express her feelings of today's performance.
“It’s difficult to listen to the ugly words and to look at these horrific works... that do people that look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said for reconstruction.
“ I do not want to realize that lynching is still a current topic, ” added, “only it is called police attacks.
On the other hand, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom and enjoys dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning a show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear that we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about,” he said.
“If we do not learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.
I love instructions to use.
One of my friends says the instructions to use are only the srab.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything was rather a rational record.
So maybe my first phonophone contained only one paper on which hieroglyphs depicting the involvement of some parts, some secret markings on everyone.
When something went wrong for years inside me, I offered that shaman's letter that wasn't afraid to screw up the back board.
He gave me a hint of what the paper with the labyrinth is suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid for chronic toilet paper depleting.
He found a hot wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl cookies again.
A new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply held a cross-sectioned jump, required about ten images.
Especially led was a sketch with a description of how to move one part into another.
The debate was two-part, and another procedure was simply not possible.
To give it the opposite required considerable effort with the need to separate certain plastic parts.
My contempt of instructions ended with my own Seat Leon signature.
The year of production 2003 was still such a prince with the instructions for minor repairs, including the exchange of blinkra bulbs.
It was easy.
Three steps total and the work was supposed to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the guide forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right went to change really only in three steps.
1. separate the cover.
2. Fuck a crack bulb and screw a new one.
3. remove the cover.
The left shark had a problem in the form of a battery cover location.
At first, I thought that by moving the right upper limbs into the car's cutting, I'd find some gear, screws, and then I'd follow points 1-3 savings author of the service book.
I think it's the lava.
The cover had no place, no space for the slick hand of Popin, let alone the Oscillating Slesen.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was still strengthened by the entry of my wife into the garage, which he called his lips and the words that my mouth hears very exceptionally.
What are you doing here? She asked for nothing.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I had missed the vulgar terms, there were only two published words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
- And why does it take so long to risk you with a sentence that may be her last in a long term bond?
I slowly explained the problem, and I put the main emphasis on the torture process of the author of the instruction, where blessing the burnt iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, by putting it down, so that it could never write anything again, was simply a introduction to a wide range of instructions by Kladiva on the witch, including its comic fire on the top of the Losin lock.
How about decommissioning the box, having a woman put out the battery?
This occurred in clear despair and then steps 1-3 were as easy and as fast as on the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day that I got a call from a colleague who just got away from the collapse post-checking two-blockers of the State Medical Control Service.
I know him as an equal colleague who has experienced even impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories with an unbroken voice.
“Consistent that I received a fine for not putting out instructions on washing my hands,” he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually generated the whole problem that touched him in the fact that in the washroom of patients, there is no picture instructions to wash their hands.
His argument by the Commission is that grown-ups usually know how to wash their hands and that they do not need icons to handle the common activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost it a small amount of money.
It's not just that, she told him.
He understood that a simple fulcrumb of soap-washed flowing water is a primitive act at the level of the limition that a person modern, Homo sapiens sapiens, is carrying out this ceremony in ten steps.
So it must be said that it is necessary to leave the tap of water.
The whole process has 11 points, but at the end, it's a joyful finding that a man washed his hands exactly as he ordered it to be a hosudar from the SÚKL.
Finally, I must point out that I let myself inspire myself and prepare a detailed plan for action in the bathroom.
In the question of defection, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, in the case of wetness, given a certain differences in both sexes, two instructions will need to be raised.
The problem is that these icons remain, because creating a perfect procedure means even the exact drawing of all anatomic details, which could wake up at a pruder visitor toilets of certain side-by-side, resisting that he finally can learn that he spent all his life using the appropriate openings of a completely incorrect procedure.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce dividends in an attempt to restore business
On Friday, the Pearson Group of British Education stated that it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another run-off wave, which, according to the statement of Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, will be followed by the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees in the course of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs of another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in an effort to increase trade due to the sharp development of digital education.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann stated that the view of this year remained unchanged after it declared a single percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £ 2.05 billion.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul. During the attack one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, said official representatives.
Five soldiers and interpreters were wounded, stated in NATO's statement.
According to informal reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh City District.
This month, more than 30 people were killed by Afghanistan's bomb attack - on Tuesday during an explosion in the heroic Mosque.
On Monday, a suicide attack killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that the Tuesday explosion occurred after a patrol with the members of the Afghan army was attacked by “a local person with a subspace produced by an explosive device”
The statement further states that all military injuries are outside the threat of life and are located at the U.S. military hospital on the Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs' statement, the increasing power of the Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is a major source of concern for NATO's allied forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb was killed in a car of at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
Taliban volunteered for the attack.
On May 31st, he killed a large explosion in the city centre of over 150 people. This is the most deadly military attack in the country since the U.S. units have thrown down the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is already undermined by such a questionable situation in Afghanistan and the US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of American soldiers who should assist military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have been shaken in the past few weeks by public confidence in the government, its regulation and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín.
EPA reassessed its decision to withdraw smoking rules in response to the action
The US Environmental Protection Agency rejected its decision to postpone Obama's administration law, which ordered the States to reduce emissions, only on the day after the Agency has sued 15 States.
EPA announced its decision on the delegation of ‘zone standards 2015’ during the Wednesday nights, with the words that the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with States.
\"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and hear their views,\" said Director Scott Pruitt in his statement.
Pruitt announced in June the efforts of EPA to postpone ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of measurements set limits to be met by October 2018.
The 15th group of the majority of democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed an action on Tuesday with a reason that the EPA negotiations were illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trumpa aims to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama, according to Trump's words in an attempt to undermine economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have started countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups that are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA on its website states that breathing of air with ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got wound and the blood flowed!
This, in our new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this time we have almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event on Czech terms, where he hosted such prominent figures as Master Karel Gott, Lucie White, Simon Krain and many others, and no one else was able to do the event other than Leoš Maresh.
The purpose was simple, to show yourself to the public, and to present your music video clip to Sara's song whose baptism just became called personalities.
However, a few already know that the film making itself that took place in Russia did not happen without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it didn't happen without a proper gloom.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene he had a singer's juice in his video clip to suggest a punch.
At one point, however, he was struck so strongly and directly in the nose that young singer had to be treated by doctors.
“It was morning, I didn’t expect it, I immediately got blood from my nose,” Ladislav commented on the situation.
The colleges and producers said that it was an unfortunate coincidence and Ladislav was not able to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious as to affect the continuation of the next film.
We now bring you a video clip of a young artist, you can also record the scene with the punch.
Uninhabited version with blood, but not more used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most demanding boxing game in a light vase, first met at an Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the failed champion in a light scale World Boxing Council - came down to the hall where Lomachenka welcomed the champion in the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime game, both boxers got to the list of five best boxers in a lightweight.
Garcia drew his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck
Lomachenko defends on Saturday at 19: 00s his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN.
Boxers serve for photographers and manager Lomachenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential boxer fight would be “a perfect test”
“I am the former champion of the cockweight,” Garcia adds.
\"For the struggle with the Broner (67 kg) I had to raise, but I'm not so big.
On my 63 kg, I'm small.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
Lomachenko's got to come back to get lightly weighted... then we can go out.
The fans are looking for it.
Why don't they do it?
Lomachenko agrees.
“The box would benefit -
Klimas raised a demand for payment for sight - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should graduate his debut in a light weight at the end of this year and next year to go with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the fight against the winner of the duo Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who took on the title in the lightweight in the Forum.
“The belt should take the style of payment for looking at, they request fans,” said Garcia, who later stated that there is an open opportunity to send a game through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attractions.
No one else will draw such attention.
We will wait for the right opportunity -
Garcia said that he recognized Lomachenka as a “acquitted boxer” and could participate in his Saturday game.
Lomachenko didn't give Garcia the honor of rounding up when he said that the champion of three Divisions from Riverside looked “very slow... Sorry, Mike, but you're thinking about knockouts”
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other's duel.
\"You won't forget this fight.
There's no other game to pay so much attention to each other.
And I will put great comfort in the fire,\" said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: “I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey--
It's gonna be a great game--
A young couple 12 years ago, he disappeared without a trace.
They found their car on Volhy's bottom right now.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
They have developed a large search, but without success.
And in the end, the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of a lost couple have lived in uncertainty that they will not know what happened to a couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the whole story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver on the bottom of the River Volhy in Čeboksary in Kuwait.
Only thanks to the documents that were left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The evidence survived the entire underwater decade, without them, would take much longer to identify the identified people.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous so far.
He reported his findings to the Serbian police, who pulled the car out on the beach the following day.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a firm road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, after its completion further details will be published.
Latest test results to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subject to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been asked as 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rêtttsmedicialvertket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess candidates in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was brought up after the Swedish Migration Agency (Mmigrationsverket) was criticized for failure in determining the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
The Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to date and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, carried out from mid March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were considered as 18 years of age, while in the next 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the question was “a possible older than 18 years old.
In other 423 cases, it was decided that the question was “may be less than 18 years old.
The test shall be subject only if the age of the disputed age is.
According to Johan GÅsransson of Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
“In contrast to last month statistics are kept in the rolling tracks and numbers are very similar,” he said for The Local.
The higher number of candidates whose age was estimated to age 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie by their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and indicated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned was 18 years or older,”
The New Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 cases published and found that, in 243 cases, he had reported that he would have 18 years of age this year.
Critics have also experienced a medical method of determining age, which includes X-ray teeth of wisdom and MRI scan of knee joints, which subsequently judge dentists and X-rays.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological origins of people to determine the age of which the teenager concerned went through.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of the biological age is very uncertain in a certain sense.
If we cannot determine the age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise,” said Metro.
Forensic Medical Agency Agency Agency Agency Agency’s GÅsransson advocated the decision by saying: “The risk of wrong assessment of a child as an adult is very small.
The highest risk represents the fact that the requested person is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all the questions asked.
Trump threatened President Mexico on the phone.
American President Donald Trump in January's call to the Mexican President Enrique Pňa Nietov threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for building a wall between the USA and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that funding would somehow be arranged even if he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke openly.
It's coming out of the transcripts of the talks that the American daily The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of the wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last year's pre-election campaign.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking up the function of Trump Peňu Nieta undiplomatically lark for building the wall.
The Southern neighbor has hatched as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president to publicly say that his government will never pay for the wall.
“You can’t say this to the press,” said Trump repeatedly in an interview of 27 January and threatened to interrupt contact with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a supportive statement.
They say financing is going to come up somehow, and it's going to end well.
But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me,” said Trump.
The wall was called the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it's probably the most important thing.
The exclusive order to build the Trump wall was issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico’s construction and financing of walls with a length of 3200 kilometres is refused, and the relations between the two countries have therefore increased.
In late March, Trump said that the project would be paid to the United States so far.
Trump finally met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed about Trump's phone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28th.
Boss of the White House, the conversation was called ridiculous.
To that end, it has made an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia will provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the adoption of persons from international facilities in the Pacific Island States.
Trump first considered the deal stupid, but later he joined it.
“You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you created, but you will have to stick to it,” said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, a telephone interview with Turnbull was almost grievous, for example, when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to receive refugees coming in boats.
- You're worse than me, - he was kidding Trump.
Suddenly, he's spooked that conversation.
“I hate to accept these people,” said Trump.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
“They will not be great people who will be able to work for local milk,” he said.
He also pointed out in the interview that a fugitive could become an asset from Boston in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, i.e. about a week after coming to the White House, phone interviews with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
The conversation with Turnbull finally called it the least pleasant in the whole day.
Before he finished him, he raised that he had a pleasant conversation with the Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
They executed Rana's killer before the crowd.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place at the square in the capital city of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Ran Almatari who lived in his neighborhood for his sacrifice.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took him to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which then threw close to the Mosque.
The violent death of little girls hit the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of the thousand - head crowd that came together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel like I'm being reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
And the other members of the family were present, along with the crowd shouted the password, and the righteousness lived.
A messenger in the square brought a police van from which it was removed.
The police put him on his stomach.
One member turned his weapon against him and started fire immediately.
The conscious crowd celebrated every wound that was fired.
Mr al Almatari said to the MailOnline website that justice was performed in accordance with the country's legal system.
- Justice, Alah, and the law of Sharia won, - he added.
I stood in the Square of liberation in Sana and waited for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jamilah are grateful that justice has been accomplished.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would fall through hateful madness, the killer would fall and drain.
The execution was ordered by a court under the command of Shia Hútí.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 punches, but his act woke up such a disaster that the judge decided for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Ran's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, she found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
“Our family has no enemies and the injuries that did not hurt Ran's body were horrific,” he said to the media.
\"Rana disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told it to the newspapers and to all our television stations, posters with her photo hanging everywhere,\" he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible act.
A girl's mother, Jamilah, must have been hospitalized after she found out her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to go out playing with other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where he was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgruntled by the crime and began gathering before the police station, where al Maghrabi was held, and demanding immediate punishment.
Deputy Ministry of Justice read the present crowd's investigation record to calm them down.
The accused did not show regret over his actions.
Just before the punishment was carried out, the police read him a verdict, but the convicted man only took a flight to look at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many records on the internet that the crowd ordered.
Governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at the meeting of President Trumpa that he was moving to another side.
“If you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their back on me,” said the Governor of Justice.
\"Today, after long prayer and thinking, I am telling you... today as a people of West Virginia, I am telling you that I cannot continue to support you from the democratic governor's position.\"
The entrance of the watching ones exploded in joy.
“Tomorrow, I will report to the Republican,” said Justice.
\"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game,
Trump had already promised people to attend the West Virginia Assembly important announcements.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited great property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement: “The course of the Governor of Justice is another morning for a democratic party that puts obstacles to our journey instead of giving rise to our country’s recovery.
“For a democratic side that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last drop for an already so-called side without a leader who is in vain seeking to find a positive and unifying report,” said RNC Ronna McDanielová, in her statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises “direct - excuse of Russia for the Doping scandal
Former outstanding sporter Sebastian Coe praised Russia for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated again that there was no real time to return Russia to the sports world.
The chief of Russian athletes Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - who took place in the previous MS in the athletes - that evicting his country from the world of sport was right and that it was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the atlets who have lost gold and silver medals in this way. ”
Despite his comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency report (WADA) concluded that Russia supported the Doping of their athletes.
“I think that today we have witnessed very sincere answers and presentations,” said President Sebastian Coe to journalists.
“All members of the Council and Congress have been pleasantly surprised that Russia has granted its mistake and works out of all forces to correct and restore the right function of the entire Federation.
Coe said that he was also “loved - that Russia has accepted criteria for reintroduction.
“I think today has been very successful and we have come to the next stage, but the congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that was murdered in Russia,” said Coe.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the unholy ones,” he concluded his speech.
At MS in the athletes starting Friday in London, under neutral flag will compete with 19 Russian athletes who have complied with strict IAAF rules.
IAAF Rune Andersen on Monday said that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it will be brought back.
The drug presence tests are still inconclusive and exclusion of trainers continue to operate, told the reporters in London after the end of the IAAF presentation.
The State Order of the CzechTrad has acquired František Savova, whose state is undermining.
The public contract of the State Export Agency CzechTrad received the publishing of the Young Front of František Savov.
Officials gave him 100 percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind the fact that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and requesting his release to the Czech Republic.
Proport agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrad has signed a public contract in April for four years to ensure the editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract in total amounted to CZK 30.8 million was obtained by the publisher of the Young Front of Business František Savova.
The Czech police charged him with tax evasion in 2014 and prosecutes him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic has asked for his release.
In case, he alerted the server Current.cz.
The award of the contract was based on the original CzechTrad criteria to decide from 60 percent of the offered price and from the remaining 40 beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
At the same time, Savovo’s company significantly helped the second criterion.
According to information, Dotyk.cz received a hundred points in all sub-quality criteria.
It just moved her to another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a portion of CZK 404 900 a month, the VLM offered CZK 324 350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it has gained 62 points from assessors in all qualitative criteria.
The team also participated in the consultant company BDO Advisory and digital agency R-media, which falls as well as the server currently.cz under the label of Economia.
VLM issued several objections against the outcome with the fact that its evaluation considers a non-legislative and not sufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it decided to attack competition with the Authority for the Protection of Competition of the ÚOHS.
He feels CzechTrade was in violation of the law.
“The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the choice of the public service provider on the basis of a level of subjective assessment, a clearly favorable participant of the Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the appellant and other suppliers,” writes in the proposal for the initiation of the procedure submitted at the ÚOHS this week which published the server in the Official Journal.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors, VLM Michal Klíma appears to be an unfamiliar and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
“Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success to one of the competitors as unlikely and suspected,” said Klíma.
The CzechTrade has not yet expressed its view on the situation.
CzechTrad will not generally comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about you mentioned in the contract is published in the contracting authority's Profile and in the Public Contracting Party.
After the contract has been completed, the full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot comment on it,” said Stephen Long.
The young front responded with a statement that it considers extremely problematic that the label of Economy hit an article in Update.cz in the competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this was mentioned in that Article.
It could have helped her by providing BusinessInfo's database services in the previous four years.
The contract first suffocated in 2013 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Cuba ODS.
František Savova blames the police on tax evasion in connection with excessive deduction of VAT on its companies, which caused the Czech state to a alleged damage to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, he is behind his criminalization as the head of the movement of ANO Andrei Babiš, under whose influence the publisher's Mafra.
The London court rejected Savovo's appeal against the release last year, but the businessman called off.
From our point of view, the case has not moved since last year, from Great Britain, we have not received any explanation in respect of the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment until this day,” said Štěpánka Zenklová, for the current.cz spokesperson of the Prague state representative of Štěpánek Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was represented in Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Czechoslovak Samson beer industry, and in the Maraflex Cyprus company, which is profiled as an investment fund, purchasing a threatened asset.
He should also manage the collapse of the Heavy Machinery Services company, previously Legios, who owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the nearby Socialist Union of youth.
The biker was running along the sidewalks and the park, ended up in the boilers.
The biker drew attention to a carefree ride across the streets, pedestrians and parking trails in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to drive her in the direction of Stanovišt.
“Policy men followed the city with caution when, on one of the side paths behind Mariánské Lázně, he failed to control the motorcycle and went into the field where he crashed,” said the police spokesperson Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, an ambulance helicopter must have arrived in the accident, which was transported by the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
The police found out that the biker had no driver's license, the motorcycle registration marks were cut off, its production number has been removed and the production label itself has been removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The reason for the motorcycle is another investigation.
However, a positive result on the substance methamphetamine was detected at the site of alcohol in the driver’s driver’s presence, adding a police spokesperson.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymara to Paris
The rules concerning the financing of European football clubs do not disturb Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona to France Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by an EUFA organisation that supervises European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in prestigious Lize masters.
The financial fair play rules (FFP) that introduced UFA in 2011 provide that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer has not been financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary in the sum of several tens of millions a year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a rich cataric family who has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymara into such a starful football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on purchasing players, but on the other hand they must prove the legal source of income, which allows them to cover the living costs of trading activities related to football.
TheFFP introduced Michel Platini after the entry into the chair of the EUFA director in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that are in pursuit of new reinforcements are indebted to be subject to and risking bankruptcy if the banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP re-directed its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that a business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend a hot sum for players to build a global brand - suddenly it was not so beneficial.
In the course of the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may show losses of EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Čeferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The rules of theFFP are still valid and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,” said Accompanied Press Andrea Traverso, who supervised compliance with the FFP rules last week.
Although the PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in one-time payment, the amount may, for accounting purposes, be distributed to the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44,4 million per year for a period of five years.
The first wave of the highest penalties of the FFP hit in 2014 PSG along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi group.
PSG took a fine of EUR 60 million (82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the Men's League of Masters to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25 players.
UFA is careful about teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through the club owners' company.
Thus, even if the Catar company sponsors PSG as soon as funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, the EUFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amounts.
A similar measure was taken by UFA in 2014 after it decided that the funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority of PSG was too high.
Part of the Neymar's income in PSG could be paid out according to some reports from the MS Organising Commission in football 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become an EUFY ambassador in football and that such maneuvers would easily reveal themselves.
The previous penalties imposed on PSG mean that the EUFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the Tuesday expressed by UFA’s dedicated persons, no investigation was launched in the matter of the transfer of Neymara to PSG.
The purpose of this report was to remain anonymous because it is not justified to comment on the situation with PSG, the Agency has stated the Associated Press.
The last published accounting statements show that the PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling dressings.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the contract signature.
The leaders of the Spanish League, apparently concerned with the departure of one of the greatest stars, sought to erase Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would break the rules of the FFP.
“It is a clear case of the “financial doping” club and the state,” said President la Liga Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG of the Catarian Syndicate Club.
The Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same position La Ligy on financing the club.
“This is the result of ownership that has changed the football world since the foundation in the last 15 years,” Wenger heard Thursday.
“As soon as the club owner becomes a club owner, it is possible to do everything.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult as the State may have different interests in participating such players in its club -
Spartan backup Russian: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand appealing foot fans.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the square.
Same scene as in Sunday play against the Bohanians.
The Spartan Warrant was moving against the Crný Zvezda game, made up a few gamekeepers, but his classmates didn't go to black.
The air force pumped with new multimillion reinforcements, so after the opening doubles in the European Cups, ends.
Was there anything else that was hard to do after Belgrade's goal?
After the inked goal, we had to shoot four, which was hard for us.
At least we didn't want to lose, raise our confidence, so that we should go away from what to other fights.
We had some chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the fight for so long?
The game is so busy.
The combination of opponents was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we fired once in half.
That is, of course, very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you need to push your opponents into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the set?
Of course, it's one of the pains when they form a new manhood.
We've only played three competition games and the team is still changing.
The point is that the coach can find the perfect 11th to sit down.
Is it encouraging for you that you've already played a part of the two games together?
It's still just part of the play.
I don't know how my condition will develop, and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as with the injury.
If you don't believe me, you can't come back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be worse.
Fans came back in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was once again a wonderful visit, just like with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
To prove something they'll come up with next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without any cups at least be an advantage to the league?
We're fighting ourselves so far, we're playing, so it's not that good for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the businessman is ten years away.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint by the businessman Jiří Toman, who is supposed to serve ten years in prison for the shorting of taxes.
The estimated damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that the justice had infringed his fundamental rights, the effect of finding judgments in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges referred to the complaint as unfounded, found the ČTK out of the court database.
ÚS is not another appeal court.
‘It cannot, as a fourth instance, judge the facts or legal doubts allegedly committed by the General Courts if they do not constitute infringements of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms, it is in the resolution.
Toman was judged as a fugitive.
Verdict is competent since November 2015, when the Supreme Court in Olomouc confirmed him.
At that time, Toman was in a teaching custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The General Court referred to the case as an extreme tax leak, which has up to the macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
A man worked as Chairman of World Service Board between 2005 and 2008.
The amount of CZK 645 million was incurred only for the period from January to July 2008, and the total leak of the expert exceeded billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the defendant, World Service did not include any invoices in its tax award.
The place of monthly VAT and excise duty in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some companies that the company has traded with have a relationship with Radomír Zychora, whose justice has dealt with as a VAT machine for 13 years in fuel stores.
He also rejected his complaint before the Constitutional Court.
“ Not for survival” series, and “Comrade Detective” plays on the nostalgic string
This faction of the story is nostalgic both for characters from the famous 1980s; as for the dirty 1990s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter stated on MTV the comedy sketch “The State”); and of course also for modern times, namely 2001, before the stars as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were able to make bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also the emblem of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
But it looks like someone's breathing is running out of sight.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (a story about the formation of talking can be about the formation of vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin has spoken).
The authors have turned away from the main funny point of view - middle-aged actors who play teen horny children - and could not pull out of previous events.
Continued “This Years Letter - in which adults play adults do not push so much on emotional plane and satira is a place to be complacent, including parody on thrillery from the 1990 ’ s as “Ruka on the colébce”
At one point, the figure will be found at a pile of Apple Powerbook, collector skates, and “all other things from 1991, ”
Many major stories are repeated.
The Dobrrdre Coop (Mr Showalter), now the writer, has still not moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (the same Mr. Showalter) which encourages George H. W. Bush (very well-deserved Michael Ian Black).
As always, they are the best part of Frenches many side stories.
Especially fun is watching the eternal young Rudd with long hair, and the character of Matt Dillon from the movie Young, whose once respected figure of Andy is now behind an old paprika.
The French could start moments of random madness, such as the “Seven Up” series, until it reaches what I suppose it will be logical: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twetty Years Letter,” when the whole group will be released on the last scene “Léta for non-life” Prime Minister.
“Comrade Detective, on Amazon, appeals to another type of nostalgic: the revitalism of the Cold War series “Ty normal Americans - film “Atomic Blond: No regret, and even the series “GLOW” in which the icons of East and West Wrestling scene are encountered.
The composition of Brian Gatewood's creators and Alessandra Tanaka in Rhys Thomas's regime is to act as a television production: the drama of two bookkeepers from Romania of the 1980s who are fighting for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Lennicism.
The main role - a tenacious Gregor and idealistic Iosefa - is played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which was titled in English Channing Tatum (a powerful producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
In some jokes you smile (such as police watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The series gave its voice to many known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
“Comrade Detective - but it is too focused on the unscrupulous propaganda drama - which includes also a killer with a mask Reagan - and it also looks like that.
Six long episodes are too angry and comedy moments aren't enough.
In shorter tracking, propaganda satir could work in “Comrade Detective”, such as in the scene, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly attend the US Embassy, where the two fat people blow burgers sitting in a large pile.
The clear message for the imaginary communist community is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The thought of Romanian creators was not wrong: we do with our own culture as well as theirs.
The Russian athletes failed to cancel the launch ban from the IAF.
The International Amatic Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on start of Russian racers due to the state supported by the Doping Programme.
The vote in the world championship stage, which starts on Friday, came out very clearly as expected.
For the extension of the ban, 166 delegates were spoken, only 21 votes against.
The main reason for rejection is that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as the Head of Special Investigation Group IAF Run Andersen said before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been answered, and in the country the trainers are still working with a corrupt reputation.
RUSADA is not fully operational yet, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
RUSADA may, however, be carried out under the revision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping agencies.
\"Although progress has been made, there is still a need to do a lot of work,\" said President IAF Sebastian Coe.
Russian Attletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, Russian athletes so they lost, among other things, the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians, who have previously proved to have been tested for longer outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But they won't be able to start at national colours at the championship, and in the event of victory, they won't play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will receive a interest rate of 0,25 %
According to England, it should be expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following the unexplained economic growth and weakening inflation, which underwent speculation on sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “in the background, in connection with the maintenance of interest rates - in spite of family budgets.
The political factors of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of England voted six to two to maintain interest rates of 0,25%. The results of the vote for the increase in interest rates have supported unexplained economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank predicted to increase to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
In the next few years, the Bank also indicated that growth as a result of inflation caused by Brexit was expected to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted for the withdrawal of part of the mother's package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago as an answer to Brexit.
As a result of the above mentioned above, it should start paying the agreed financing plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England said that, compared to the $115 billion planned, £15 billion will now offer £15 billion less.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC submits that the gross domestic product (HDP) will, in short term, stand together with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption,
On the basis of the rates, the Bank stated that it would be necessary to ‘to draw the option of monetary policy’ to calm inflation, ‘at a higher rate than the markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be ‘free,’ and ‘limited’.
The Bank reduced growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 amounted to 1.8 % remained unchanged.
Following the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11 euro.
The decision to maintain the current state came after a draught increase in hope for further growth - GDP stopped to 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0,2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although slightly increased at the end of the year.
The latest report on inflation is a carefree comfort for households affected by rising inflation and a poor increase in wages. The Bank said that the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report further states that the monetary policy will “can not prevent the reduction of income in the coming years, but it is expected that wages will ‘ rise markedly to the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also grow thanks to great interest in British goods thanks to weak libra, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came one year after last year the rates were reduced to 0.025% in response to the shocking votes on the EU referendum, resulting in a fall in libra.
The Bank estimates that there will be at least four years of full harmonisation of prices and economies.
Before the decision of the Bank on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates, along with an increasing inflation, which increased pressure on the household, and three political factors required an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation dropped back to 2.6% of June 2,9 % last month, even though the bank claimed that it had expected such a change and the inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the relative overrun to 2% of the target was ‘excellent’ as a result of weak libra.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that the competition on the mortgage market will only stand as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and mortgages - free of charge options are available as well as the low rates that they receive on the dam -
NHS will prescribe controversial HIV therapy to 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access from September to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention on the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure pphylaxis (PEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high risk patients up to 86 percent, will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Board of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year with the view that the NHS had financial resources to pay the PEP despite the statement that the medicine should finance local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was adopted by NHS England from the mouth of Director General Simon Stevens as a major intervention, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) of the decision described as “the decisive moment”.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Another clinic will join in October and until April 2018 will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a HIV medicine that is administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PreEP is significantly reducing the risk of HIV transfer among vulnerable patients.
PreEP prior to sex means that the patient has sufficient specific medicines to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who will sign their consent with participation in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK may also sign up in their local sexual health clinic and address potential participation in testing.
The programme will come to 10 million £ and the NHS of England signed this week a contract to distribute drugs after obtaining international public contracts.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PEP, its treatment, use and implementation in a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be completed and fully burdened with constantly expanding and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
He's another milestone in over 30 years trying to stop one of the biggest challenges in human health.'
Deborah Gold, CEO of the NAT (National Aids Trust) said: ‘We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PreEP is administered correctly and to patients at risk, it will offer the potential to change the British HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer patients who are exposed to high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and does not subject to the need to convince a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘The number one has to be a quick deployment of tests throughout the country; we need to ensure that each patient is available.
We now have a preEP trial and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.’
He said: “The beginning of the preEP trial period is welcome and the long expected change after months of delay and retention by government.
The evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending this life-threatening infection.
The follow-up tests will lead us one step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the PreEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country and protect those exposed to HIV and complete the spread of HIV in society together.’
Life on the high leg: interpath and smart design turned this small apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, former banker with a passion for real estate, replaced a great house in Knightsbridge for apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is an impressive example of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
“I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” said Joanne.
“I've been looking for something more reasonable than that.
I ran into this apartment at Earls Court and had the same height of ceiling.
I fell in love with him right now, and I was on him the same day--
Since then, he's been through an apartment with a size of 1000 square meters complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated dissipation - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the space and the interpath to use a high ceiling.
“I longed for high ceilings, large windows and lots of lights.
That's what my demands were,\" she said.
To this end, Erfan Azadi employed from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, using nearly four meters ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights to climb above each other two spaces - a challenge for architects was thus to create an interpath where it would be possible to walk in the crossroads.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is completely complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk uprightly.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the steel construction in such a way that the height above and below the ceiling would be correct.
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two full rooms on its own - and also add to dramaticness.
In the meantime, the old copper windows are looking at a wonderful living room in the Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro mirrors Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticness, space and lighting.
Short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so long.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storage of collections and greenhouses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the entire apartment an impression of a much larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if not used.
Glass kitchens aren't new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the diaphragm door.
“We had to solve the technical site,” says Erfan, about the hardened carpets.
“The door is provided by counter-terrorism to take it very easily -
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes to it, what you sell is a residential area, or an award of your property,” Erfan said.
‘Real broker essentially calculates the estimated price on the basis of residential areas when entering the apartment;
In this case, it has been able to increase the residential area while maintaining quality materials that lend the space of luxury appearance.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional connection with home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love the power grids in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts won't get them.
As it turned out, the quality design and the increase in the residential space can transform the ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States are beginning.
Cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepened.
California has declared a ban on the journey of its citizens to the State of Tennessee and other seven states.
The State of Tennessee paid her back and declared a resumptuous ban on travelling his citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in full terms, citizens of the United States can travel freely in all 50 countries.
It is true that California has forbidden state money to spend on the path of its citizens to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and any expression of opposition to LGBT's lifestyle considers it discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted a law on the exception of conscience, according to which psychotherapy, which has a moral problem with the treatment of LGBT patients, has no obligation to provide them, however, has an obligation to provide such patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws according to which religious charities which have received children from mothers after birth to adoption have no obligation to provide these children to adoptions to the same sex couples.
Because of these laws, California has prohibited its citizens from financing the route to eight states of the Union from its means of conscience.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have a trip to a scientific symposia, for example, in Texas paid from their universities, because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support to their schools.
There must be federal grants on the road, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund the path of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsoring.
The state of Tennessee has become patient, and its parliament has adopted a law with resolution that it also does not like California's high tax policy, high state expenditures, high deficits, and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it does not influence California's travel embargo.
He's putting them away as a respite for California's travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every state of the Union, who would order a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he invited the Parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, it's all constitutional, there's no counter-responsible.
States have the right to adopt laws on conflict of conscience as well as to decide what their money is going to be and what they cannot do.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience?
If the butcher had a religious problem selling pork, why couldn't he just offer beef, lambs, poultry and fish?
Why is it required under sanctions to sell pork when butchers offering pork is enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to make a cake for a homosexual wedding.
He refuses to cook Halloween cakes or containing alcohol, too.
Why don't you punish him and leave him alone and order the right cakes for hundreds of other bakerys?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states may have internal domestic policies in powers which are not federal, adjusted according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, the LGBT community had once been legally committed to tolerance towards their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of living, and let them live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not tolerance against themselves and others, but about extreme non-tolarians against others.
No one can ever show moral, religious or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle anymore, and if they do so, it is to be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
In the fifth time, I don't know the situation in American history, when states have done so because of political issues, except for the one case.
Even in times of struggle for civil rights of black people, where North and West were on the side of integration and South on the side of the congregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was that of the 1950s, the political caususus was slavery and the North Wars against South.
Of course, there will be nothing like this now, but the situation is still toxic.
Cultural and political divide between the countries of blue democratic and red republican states is deepened and the US are mentally committed.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin got a little fine.
The Russian opposition policy Alexej Navalnyi received a fine of 300 thousand rubles for violation of the campaign rules before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court held a fine to him for inviting people to participate in undeserved demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny organized two major anti-governmental street protests and announced that he wanted to address the state's head in March next year.
President-in-Office Kreml Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidate, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He gave him a fine for inviting people to demonstrators through videos placed on YouTube's website.
The lesson is three hundred thousand.
“Let us draw them from the judge’s salary,“ he was joking on the Kremlin’s twitter.
The Russian electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalnyi was unable to participate in the presidential elections, because he had previously been convicted of embassies.
However, the judgment in question considers it politically motivated.
At the rate of 300 thousand rubles, a court of 25 thousand rubles on Thursday also laid down two members of the Naval pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyy entered Russian politics as an anticorruption blogger and gradually became a dominant personality on a fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign.
In February he was sentenced to a five-year-old parole sentence because he stole Kirovles' forest business.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal.
The judgment is so competent, which, according to the Russian laws, prevents candidates from running.
Brothers are fighting for an empire worth over 500 million dollars.
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire of their Italian family, are taking over one of the most expensive Victorian real estates worth more than 500 million dollars.
Former Director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis is staying in the estate of Toorak, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has had a dispute on the common property and commercial property up to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly denied before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna's own brothers, 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, the first store bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, Westco Jeans started a family that grew into a chain with 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company to convert $85 million.
For money they bought other properties and portfolios of the family De Lutis now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns approximately one third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is “a significant driving force and dominant personality - the family of De Lutis, owns an infinite two-thirds of the assets.
Court records say Colin owns a property worth $316 million while Paul manages real estate for 176 million.
Paul's problem just became the distribution of assets and funds.
“Colin’s proposal spoke significantly in my eyes in his favor, ” wrote Paul in a preliminary declaration in the judgment in 2015.
Last Friday, after a few failed attempts at peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now are also competing for who will control the existing business, from which Paul cut off according to his statement Colin.
Colin resists the fact that it's not true and accuses Paul of misinterpreting certain properties.
In Colin's previous statement, he said that he believed in the apparent settlement of the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates that my family is of all importance,” he wrote.
The costs of the court stand up. Hundreds of pages of foreign statements, e-mails and news from the company, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood attorneys, including Allana Myers, QC and defence attorneys of both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and bottles since the 1950s and bought a mall in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For money obtained by stopping property, they bought real estate in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco, “the last year of college, Paul was still a little, about a 10-year-old boy--
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigim who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place well.
“ Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court, ” she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of the De Lutis family. Colin said that Mark was trained by a sum of $10 million in his departure and Luke amounted to $26 million.
As said by Paul, Luke and Mark, “will not be satisfied with the terms and conditions of his financial compensation“
Colin has been holding back since then, despite the fact that he is a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL, as he said in his autobiography of 2015 Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin through the text messages in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is settled before the trial, “I do not add anything to it.
“ It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter before the trial, ” he wrote.
In mid 2016 in one of Colin's statements, he said he was trying to adapt to his brother's requirements.
“Our father would be very disobedient if he saw our current situation, ” he said, “he still hopes that he will be able to find a solution.
On Friday, all hope was inconceivable.
“Our disputes will be resolved in the early trial period, ” said Colin.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers are fascinating water and summer clothes.
In the mother school of Chodovce in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now taking place, only the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a great shadow.
There's no pool, but kids' teachers are showering in the mist.
In the afternoon, children remain in classes where they are severed stomachs and covered curtains.
The air is trying to cool down with air cleaners because they don't have air conditioning.
It's challenging for teachers and cooks.
“The temperature that is in the interior and exterior exceeds the hygiene limits for maternity school, so at this time we should not actually have an open operation,” said the director of school Miloslav Makkovičková.
There's a glass corridor in the kindergarten where the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We blow up the window after 6 o'clock in the morning, and we have a window on the south side of the stomach we're protecting ourselves.
But it won't help much,” she added.
They have better conditions in forest kindergartens in Hostivice where children spend most of their time outside.
We've got trees on the property, so we're under them.
“We have a beautiful peanut, there is a table under it, and there we do things,” says Barbora Komana.
Teachers try to walk in the woods with kids, where there's a bigger guy.
Children of wet hats and program have different games with water.
“We have a hand pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it for showering children,” said Komanan.
Also the principal of kindergartens in Novoborska Street on the Prague Proseku Jitka Vilimovská said that children try to keep their teachers in the shadows and drop them with water.
“We have a relatively growing garden, so they're under trees,” she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head cover.
Teachers also remind their children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a few salted teas or a diluted juice and have a drink in the garden with water.
Each day they also have to eat vegetables salad and snacks always fresh fruit and vegetables that their parents sometimes bring to them.
“Today, one mother brought about a ten - year - old melon for children,” Makkovičková added.
Drivers receive water or summer equivalent.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them in hot days of water, ion drinks or summer uniforms.
The cabs of drivers also tram buses are air-conditioned in most cases, said the spokesperson DPP Aneta Řehková.
Some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger space in addition to the cabin.
High temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged yet.
Small damage occurred in the loop in Hostivar.
At current high temperatures, we mainly care that drivers have enough drinks available.
“The cold drinking water is available in all loops, rotation points and vehicles,” says Řehková.
In vehicles and in some places, employees have so-called sodobras that produce a chilled sodium.
Drivers also receive soluble ion drinks.
“They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts,” added the spokesperson.
Hot and dry weather has been resulting in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, the firefighters destroyed 108 in the Czech Republic, i.e. twice the daily average.
On Tuesday, over the day when the temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Celsia, he employed firefighters mainly fighting fire.
“They are considering fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with the harvest work,” said Nicole Zaoral.
The firefighters' relief did not bring an evening change in the weather, when storms and shocks were fired in a number of places.
In connection with the firestorms, the firefighters went to 236 interventions.
It was particularly about removal of fallen trees and branches.
“The first time they interfered in the Mediterranean region,” Zaoralová continues.
But the firefighters needed help in Stvolinky in Czechoslovakia, where they evacuated 60 people from the children's camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also made work for Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and night at Wednesday, ambulances ran out to ten cases of carbon dioxide poisoning.
That's why people should keep their water heaters checked, warn the rescuers.
The carbon dioxide is a colourless gas without a smell that is released during imperfect combustion.
The symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media diet
Many have tried before him, and they have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, it'll be the first one.
The Politico portal stated that the new Chief of Staff at the White House is planning to limit the flow of information of President Trumpa - including reports on television reports - in the hope that he will keep Trump on the surface.
Here's part of the report, Josh Dawsey:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day of his new job, the key problem of the Trump White House, which intends to correct: the wrong information that comes to the President’s hands.
Kelly announced to the employees that he had to approve all information personally - whether on paper or in speak - because the President could choose better on the basis of the correct information -
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors on Trumpa's control, and his presentation in the media has drawn teeth.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back for decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV messages is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset with honest reports, it was convenient to show him that in a positive light he spoke of a lot of other media that was easier to convince,” said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri, from the Politico portal at that time, wrote that “a key to keeping the Trump tweets in check - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly observes the media that seek praise on him“
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was when “under control,” he is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something the others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more encouraging if they weren't checked.
We'll never get to know about tweets that Trump never sent away with.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least several times, their efforts did not come out of nowhere.
However, no one has been able to regularly prevent the Trumps from undermining controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by bringing up the materials - which they can, but may not be reliable - that support their world view.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the glass of advisers to submit doubtful information to the head of the State.
This is an example of this from Shane Goldmacher's reporter's pen:
“The current and former Trumpo officials say that the President has often responded very much to negative media reports, especially in the report on the leak of information, and is seeking to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone planted a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of the professor Charles C. Johnson - who accused the deputy chief of the staff of Katie Walsh from being a source of many leaks of information from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson has always been convicted of harassment from Twitter; or that his claim has not given any evidence; or that he has already published false accusations in the past and later called them off.
Trump read the article and began asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that the chief of staff Reince Priebus and the secretary of the White House Rob Porter “ tried to implement a system for administration and documentation of information received by President Trump,
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
He may be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just disappear and his supporters are still competing for power.
These unchangeable factors of Kelly's mission will certainly make it difficult.
Tourists are negotiating the ditch and returning to the “Milion district”
Several of the most modern owners of houses in West Midland's English county are once again being launched to cross the determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to recover the field for their seat.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a flourishing street in Solihull, which overlooks the “millionaire neighborhood”.
When bringing horses, children and army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. They were not afraid of a ditch that was buried on the ground on the basis of a regulation of authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
Such a group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with the unprotected gap that served as a journey.
The ecclesiastes of the quarter attacked the Governing Board of Solihull with the fact that they were not able to solve the problem.
One of the people who wanted to stay anonymously said: “They set up this place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they were throwing stones around other people.
The Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different place, and now they're back.
The others arrived last night, and it's about to get more of them today.'
She added that :‘Birmingham Board knows how to load this problem. To protect parks, she uses court orders.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to keep paying taxes until the board of directors deal with tourists.'
Another anonymous citizen said: “It’s ridiculous. We have just recently watched the last passing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there's more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them.'
The press spokesperson of the Management Board of Solihull said: “We are aware of the unauthorised residence on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many local residents report any dissolving or unlawful behaviour of the police on heading 101.
We're going to get the total picture we're going to bring to trial.'
The husband of the MEP hit a car in Brussels.
The government special brought him in.
The government special prepared the wounded Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane was under constant control of the Slovak doctors.
It's been a long, planned flight without complication.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer according to TV JOJ.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious shape ever since.
After transporting to the country, he was transported to a specialised workplace of one of the bratislav hospitals.

Italians confirm the fight against rescue ships NGO with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will avoid the arrival of emergency ships of NGO that are joining the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean Sea if the NGO does not sign new rules governing their operation.
“If NGO fails to sign new behavioral rules, it will be difficult for us to continue their operations,” said the Minister of Interior Marco Minni in an interview with Turin daila La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities occupied the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet by suspected trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which runs the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter because of the charges of the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
“For us is and will always be the priority of one rescue of human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate at present in rescue zones,” said the organization in the declaration on social networks.
“All current charges can only be commented upon after the assembly of all information and the assessment of the whole situation.
Italian authorities have followed the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, who have handed them directly to human traffickers, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting occurred according to the file of the applicant reportedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The meeting was published by Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and walking around the Italian coast guard, covering rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct will establish the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
Last Thursday, the appointed organisation stated that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, as they do not represent any ‘ substantial change or obstacle, as regards rescue operations.
The adoption of the new Code of Conduct has also refused, for example, the Organisation of Doctors without Borders (IMF) held by Nobel Prizes.
In the meantime, Minniti has heard that the sharp decline in immigrants in the past few weeks, which are landing in Italy under rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols on the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors carry fruit.
“In recent days we begin to see light at the end of the tunnel,” said the Minister.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with Mayor Libya on the topic of economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Nasty Mesarošová: From above was her silicone and cellulitis!
Hot summer days are all about taking on the most essential part of each other, covering up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominican Mesaroš does it on the contrary.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and all they have about doing with TV Prima, they were just dying, they put their body in the mini area.
And only a few normal moves and a model showed everyone its silicone, but also a dot.
It was over how many times it was cut between her half, and he also coughed up so high that she still had to fix it.
The attention of the gentlemen and the present photographers was certainly not necessary.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to sending text messages to Conrad Roy's suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to the withdrawal of freedom in the challenge of two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
The twelve-year-old Michelle Carter will take 15 months from a two-year-old prison sentence and then spend five years in parole.
Carter was sentenced to murder Conrad Roy in June, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father, on Thursday in court, said: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend--
Carter was left free until the decision.
She was threatened for up to 20 years to take her freedom, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream scars, Carter was standing on the stand when she declared a judgment with tears in her eyes, tied with hands and eyes pointing to the ground.
“Her conduct was killed by Conrad Roy,” said the judge’s prosecutor.
“ She ended his life to ease herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility,” she said.
“ There was no regret, ” he said.
However, the legal representative of Carter said that they were “happi circumstances that he deeply regrets, ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “they are age or level of loss or even mental disorder have no significant impact on the performance of this system.
The psalmist read Roy’s mother’s statement by Lynn Roy: “The day of the day will not come to pass, that I may not grieve against the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care about his sister and together we will bear the great pain that we will carry with us forever - it was in the statement.
Roy’s sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was “separating, ” knowing that she would never take part in her brother’s wedding, and she would never be a aunt of his children.
“The loss of a man I have seen since my birth is the pain I carry to life with me, ” she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect the person helping the suicide of another person, and this case therefore constitutes a legal precedent.
The Carters were 17 years old when Roy was found in the car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted attention to the whole nation after the text messages of Carter were published, which encouraged suicide.
“I don’t care if you are hanging, jumping from the building or stab,” wrote in text messages that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before suicide, she wrote: “You must do this to Conrad, and “It’s just to set the generator up and you’ll be free and happy. ”
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered any comments in the press to be held.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood on the side of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30) published his statement at the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison,
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just the day before the notice of Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers software update in more than 350 000 vehicles.
President BMW said that the company believes that “there are more intelligent possibilities than drivers’ restrictions - in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of BMW - which is considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would fix three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted a large measure of the use of diesel atiomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide, which releases diesel engines, is considered to be carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, car costs are increased to install equipment to neutralise gases issued by diesel engines, which make cars more competitive.
While German car manufacturers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Mercel is facing accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which in an effort to meet the emission limits installed in their software cars, which reduced the amount of emissions spent while testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several higher representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany would be arrested by former head of the thermodynamics Department of Motor Development in Audi.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he can face the trial process in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by German police in the car case Volkswagen after the authors accused Audi of installing the system that had been about European emission limits - and so extended the charges that Audi were facing in the USA.
The inclusion of Audi cars in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is an disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen’s profit.
An emergency plane landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, approximately 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the SIC Witnesses of the TV channel said that the plane was flying just above the people on the beach.
Some people from the beach were supposed to flee from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
On the beach, according to local media, a 50-year-old man died and a bright little girl died.
“The plane hit them, and they were dead at the scene,” said the local police chief Pedro Coel Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them out of the accident out alive, and the cops took them for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's not enough, even though it began to build in 1978.
Even if it's not enough, it's still getting fixed.
And it can't go on even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, D11. Castle highway.
The construction of another section for at least a few months stopped the Children Earth movement.
We east-easts get highways by pieces like when they walk salami.
They'll cut the wheel and then we'll see when and if we even get another one.
Then we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get the vests going to Poland or Poland from the village and cities.
The endless streams of kamony are going right through the city of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a wise way to get around.
However, the last section of our dream highway was carried out in 2008, i.e. before the incredible nine years ago.
Not even a knock ever since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of the unending section began recently to rise to the Royal Castle and on other sections to Jaroměři started with archaeological survey with the fact that the construction began at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of the spins in Eastern Bohemia.
I mean, no one's ever believed it.
Last week, it turns out he won't be coming up this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brno has resulted in a decomposition.
The children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
There were decisions on building permits in the whole range.
In the decomposition, it shall request a review of all the established opinions of all the authorities concerned.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the District Office.
So so far from the D11, we're going nowhere near the village with an excused name Pobřebka.
Then we're going down, we're just going on the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we prefer to get in the colon after that.
The worst part is that you see such stories throughout the country.
Sufficient, constantly encroached road to Beneshov, D1 motorway or D8.
Everyone's got their missing guy.
What do the children of the Earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network in the current system practically ineffective?

Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandule has become a symbol of Provence in the South East France, but they are now at risk of climate change.
The Levanduls remain as a result of dry climate and harmful insect, which gives a scare on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert in the Agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence said: “The growing of lavender in Provence is at risk because this plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which brings fewer precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
They also have cycads and cobs carrying micro-bacteries in the dry climate that they are doing so.
There are many at stake.
The Levandule attracts tourists and the oil that is made of them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “A place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, unexploited and often weak plants.
Of course, the quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is smaller.
The potential solution can be more effective distribution of water and the slowing of water discharge from the soil, but also the tip of the lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of multiple species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the Riodoce week regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss the news on the unrest that takes place in the Sinaloa area in the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and unscrupulous drug wars.
Today, however, the recent events are mainly due to their own safety.
They know it's important to change their habits.
Two merit journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children to an office that someone attacked the grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black board: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foresight.
Collect them from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from governments or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover crime.
The violence does not stand, and the bodies are drawn up throughout the whole country; journalists are constantly coming between them: according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists, at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pena Neta joined in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them have been killed this year in all seven countries.
Among them, the co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist, ” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence that comes with drug trafficking.
His loss is remarkable, although his presence is all-progressive - a large photograph of Valdez with the sign “Security”, which shows the middleman, hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - age over 30 years, have a T-shirt with a smile on the face, glasses on the nose and a blade of Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, two suspects have yet to be expressed by the Committee on the Protection of journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, so killer journalists get to court so exceptionally.
The newspaper from Riodoce insists on informing about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe, even though they are being destroyed by the grief and that territory is currently very traitorous.
Without information on the bumps and the lack of the sight of justice, the meeting on safety is unprepared, says Ibarra.
“ It is foolish to waste time at such meetings, ” he adds.
‘If we do not get more information, no one can believe -
On May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoce in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to run several blocks when his red Toyota Coroll was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently because of his name as an article - which can be translated as the twelveth river.
The shooters then entered his car and crashed near the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind.
It seems that the rumors spread rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest for Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest combatants of the country, as the rival faction tries to fill an empty place.
Every day there are several people killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of trained two-story mausolei for drug kings, many of which are bigger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “direction” means one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of Drugs.
As well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce still reduces the fact that he did not protect his friend.
She believes she's contributed two doubts to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
Smír could be angry with his sons; suspicious gang members bought every copy of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the counter.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country because of his own safety after the other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad and is viewed as an important milestone in combating Mexican criminals against journalists.
He was willing to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In Noroeste's period, he was practically vetted when in 2003 he decided to sell his stock worth $50 and start together with five colleagues of Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, “it was impossible to operate a journalist and not mention drug trafficking,” said Bojorquez.
In time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true intelligence; the news started to come true.
The novelists liked to be sent to search for problems and published texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to give up.
Eight years after the establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious award of Maria Moors Cabot for the report on Latin America.
The same year Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Committee on the Protection of journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was scared.
“I was concerned about my life,” he said when accepting prices.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “the way of life,” Valdez said last October in an interview for the Rompevieto TV.
“You must take the role of a journalist or play dumb.
I don’t want anyone to ask me: ‘What did you do with the face of death... why didn’t you say what was going on?’
He was known for his witting and unfamiliar language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hug - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone was relying on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guybo bar across from the office and sat at the same table.
Now they ask, \"Did this routine cause his death?\"
His death also raised questions about her own assumptions - how to do her job best and to stay alive?
“They don’t like it when you have sex with their wives, their children, clean shops, secret landing areas.
“These things were prohibited,” said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-confidence.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like there's something going on here, hands off.
The problem is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “his mind is the point that can be misled... and then something happened with Javier“
The old rules according to him, like the others, in Sinaloae no longer apply - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to toxic mix of lurking smugglers, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is changing all the time.
There are no mobile phones allowed in the room where Riodoce employees are meeting; for a few days ago, spyware was discovered, who bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Two policemen outside the building find a relief before 40 stage heats in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the State to protect Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in Culiacan City District.
Reporters are pulling out of whether these policemen aren't about 50 percent of law enforcement defenders who, according to the government's statement, are corrupt.
It's been a few months since the journalists last entered the mountainous areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three major stories on this week's show.
The first is the murder of the former boxer Julia Césara Chávez in Sinaloe.
They also have to pay for suspicious government expenditure that took place in the home town of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state attorney's office.
Officially, no one has notified the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the journalists were on guard when they were going to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name that is associated with a certain policy, which is a member of the institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of political scene almost all over the past century.
Several governors of PRI have recently been accused of corruption in high positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including an incident where one of Joaquín’s sons “El Chapo”, Guzmana escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this topic in Valdez's rubble, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
“Valdez would certainly be able to explain the case,” said Villarreal (46), who is called “El Flaco, for his lean figure.
“Now all the informants have turned their backs on us.
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protests against killing journalists. The employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press representation.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez fell several signulas and went to protest at the state attorney's office this morning because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michigan.
The authorities claim that based on DNA analysis this is Adamea.
The activity of journalists is worldwide. Many of them organize protests and they are writing on the sidewalks and buildings “SOS printing”
The head of the newspaper Bojorquez is on the day to visit Washington, where he tries to get international support and to achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who held the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murder for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department of fear that her anger could jeopardise her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “detained, organized crime, corrupt officials and indifference public.
In his last book “Narco-j Journalism”, he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels but also by order of politicians and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The Media Supervisory Group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on journalists of police and public officials.
“You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that allegedly signed Zetas’ cartel: “This is how I ended up with my messages.
There was a keyboard and headphones lying next to the cut-off head.
Some branches decided to end their business, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
The others are still continuing, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed a public drug cartel article on the initial page entitled ‘What do you want from us’
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a tough decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that you're being persecuted all the time.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape of Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and do not give up their work, there is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
\"Mexiko's heading to hell, which is why I became a journalist,\" he said.
It's Friday night and Riodoce employees sit on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when it suddenly starts calling the phone.
19 people died in a firefight between gang members and police near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is coming, just like it promised many messages left in this area by members of the Syndicate.
The reporters are publishing this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
There's not going to be one day, and the initial title changes again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to another gunfight.
Bojorquez has a fair sight of police patrols to see if they're paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't make it clear.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodica - whose middleman is an excuse for the entire Sinaloe - all the employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
“ As we could only think of leaving,” Bojorquez said, “when I was killed on the same day as Javier was killed, one intern asked me to send her to the streets.
The dinosaurs used the campaign to avoid enemies.
At first sight, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first finding of an amazing creature with the size of a rhinoceros whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have called “Mona Lisa of dinosaurs” - found the Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the red brown color of his dirty skin and said that dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
The article in Current Biologisty stated that it was the most preserved yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best kinds of dinosaurs in the world.\"
The fossil is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period of the Cross, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by researchers who described him in words “as remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the defensive white man is still the best preserved by his kind.
The Shawn Funk behind the finding, which was discovered by the fossils on 21 March 2011 while drilling at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
He ran into something that looked like a foreign subject and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palestine.
The researchers spent the following six years working to discover an animal from a huge piece of land with a weight of 1100 kg.
After completion of work, dinosaurs are ready to detect.
“He's going to make his eyes a little harder, and you'll believe he's asleep,” said the head of Caleb Brown, and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
The history of history is definitely included as one of the most beautiful and innovative kinds of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
In his study his skin researchers found that this bullfish - although it was covered by armor and resembled walking tank - he likely faced a serious threat from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavy armored dinosaur used red and white stone to protect predators and use a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts say that it helped him to get along with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News about 110 million years old dinosaurs of Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. Currently, it is available to see the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name of the Borealopelt Mark Mitchell Museum after the technique of the museum, who, together with the team, spent more than 7000 hours with careful detection of fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the formulas and shape of the ham and armor throughout the body.
They discovered the method of masking that they normally use today's animals in defence - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising because Borealopelta's size is far beyond today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution preferred to mask before confrontation when survival.
Many present animals with masking - the purchase of deer, zebra and or belter - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a prey, which suggests that rhinodaurus had to fight for his life literally.
“Predence of a huge and hard armored dinosaur shows the dangers that were present by predators during the period of chalk,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the ham also revealed that dinosaur skin was probably red brown.
The researchers continue to study the animal and search for further knowledge of his life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to spend his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea where he sank to the bottom.
In Alberta, at that time, the same climate as in Florida today and the rivers and the oceans went much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved skin and is also preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically just like at the time of the chalk.
You don't need to use your imagination to rebuild it; just make your eyes feel like it's just sleeping.'
During the time of the baptism, there were giant terrapods, carnivorous dinosaurs who were moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his equally terrible ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 metres long monster with weight over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the Current Biology magazine believe that the Borealopelt body was flooded into the sea after it was mutilated in the mud.
The Shawn Funk behind the finding, which was discovered by the fossils on 21 March 2011 while drilling at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the jaw to the hip.
The animal ranged from 5 metres in diameter and weighing up to 1300 kg.
Two hundred inches out of his shoulder.
The researchers believe that this bulldozer smothered the territory of today's Canada until it ended in a river that swamed him into the sea.
His submarine tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also maintained to the extent that armored slices around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote, the gate for National Geographic, the founding of this preserved individual can be compared to the lottery defeat.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finds me.
Fossil remains of this species are also maintained to the extent that armored slices around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right foot with fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the drawers on his hallway.'
How did one activist know the answer to the question: “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaking all over the body.
The day she arrived in New York, the native of St. Louis sat on a bed in Airbnb's room and went through Facebook contributions on her phone.
She ran into some high school student's contribution.
“The police just shot a 18 - year - old young man, whose body is still lying on the street,” it stood in.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her contribution to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published his contributions on Twitter about Michael Brown's death, an unarmed 18-year-old who shot a white male in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, which lies on the street carelessly, from where no one took it after four hours.
“This is crazy,” Ferrell thought.
Death wasn't new to her and her community.
She gave up her phone to come back to him the night she was watching tweets about people who were gathering at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed that he was the victim's father and held the sign “Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son” in her hand!
She watched live reports - one of the cops was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a clue and at the other end of his barking dog.
In another video, he held another police officer, as she said, in the hand of a weapon that he aimed at the crowd and said: “I will kill you all... animals.
\"It's not normal,\" said Ferrell.
“This is not the kind of murder we used to get used to, and we can call it normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
“ I was angry, and I cried.
She's booked her return flight right away, and she's been going home the other day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years describes the new “Whoe Streets” document, which will be included in the cinema on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and opposition, strength and indifference of people living in the community who go to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower dressing and the same flower front - a topic that had been discussed many times before - “the experience with black people -
“Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
\"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed 18-year-old and that's not right.\"
“I didn’t think I would take it with me,” Ferrell said later.
“ Today’s events are a culmination... that occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between the different layers of black people's experience and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions where she does not experience racism on her own skin, it does not differ in any way from another black child-married.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only hurt her.
Upon arrival in Ferguson was the first stop of the South Florissant Road road across from the police department, which became the base of activists who expected the words of officer Darren Wilson to participate in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met the local businessman who prepared for other food.
Together, they prepared food for bags and helped to spread it to protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” said Ferrell and added that she was the president of the Minority Student Nursess. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities when studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural -
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with her later co-director, Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrarr wanted “to document the current event.
But Ferrell thought: “You are working on a document or trying to find a story that could be used. ”
Such a type of scepticism has penetrated the community through many people, often white people who want to earn pain and discretion.
As explained by Folayan’s recent conversation: “We heard that the voices of people born and growing up in Ferguson are very often forgotten, and that is what we wanted to change. ”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a recognized local artist, who deals with the topic of prisoners in death row.
His participation in the project also followed Ferrell and along with the other six local residents, who followed the team “Whose Streets, in the years following Brown’s murder.
“No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement,” Davis said.
“That was important to me - as these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented by me -
While the purpose of the document was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences - in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the salvation leader, but on the approximation of the community,” Folayan said - it has proved that it is the most open for participation in filming.
The “Whoe Streets” document describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as she fell in love with her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said with a smile on her face when I thought about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
\"But I understand that in order to do this job and to pedestate black people, I have to open up -
In addition, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of Central Black Women in a broader aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to killing the teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weird.
“The black ecclesiastical women in leading positions in the final result are behind the movement,” said Ferrell, “because we are constantly fighting on more fronts.
Black ecclesiastes women must bear the weight of these events -
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a great multitude of ecclesiastes black women. ”
However, he insists that “this is not a mere, and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of his views.
“This was the driving force and energy source, ” she said.
“ That she just found herself in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these crossroads in the skin of black weird women is dangerous.
You feel this energy wave in front of the screen, too -
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of television stations have cleared their positions, but a heavy racial bond between the community and police continues.
Ferrell's serving two and a half years' condition for blocking the highway in demonstrations.
Socially political atmosphere in the area that it calls home described as “Security, ”
Still, she hasn't stayed in her efforts, which she'd committed since she went to Ferguson's street three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains.
There was a field on Kolínsk.
There were dozens of firemen on the scene, and he helped the helicopter.
Near the Czech Brod in Kolínsk, between the villages of Yony and Liblice, it was on fire from 14:00 a field of about 15 hectares.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firefighters reported a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the spokesperson, Ladislav Holomčík helped the fire from the air fire and helicopter.
At 18:00 the firefighters managed to fire, the fire caused damage for CZK 700000.
With flames at the scene, dozens of professional and voluntary firefighters fought.
The fire was created due to the technical failure in the chamber motor space.
Hasit also helped a helicopter that made a total of six shots of water.
“We handed over places of intervention to the owner, until 8:00 tomorrow, he will be guarded by a unit of voluntary firefighters,” said Holomčík today.
And Becoming Resemblance: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
On the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is placed just several faces of various shades of the skin - white, black and snow - wrapped from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them as if the previous one fell out of the eye.
All 30 portraits created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg's artist from the extracts of the oral cavity and hair that she sent her Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples back from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where she's been serving 35 years' sentence for incorrect publication of classified cassograms on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which started on 2 August, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pioneer dissident, whose sentence reduced Obama three days before his departure from the post of President of the United States.
Algoritmic analysis of DNA Manning and using 30 portraits to demonstrate how man would look with this genotype, created Dewey-Hagborg's thin, if not intellectual comment on the subject of DNA - as well as on many ways to interpret DNA - and the ingenuable determination of these interpretations as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has already talked about being considered a woman since she was young. In 2013, she was tried on the basis of twenty defendants, including violation of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were kept by prison employees. Only one black and white photos in the lower quality on which Manning, visibly concerned, is sitting on the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig with which he is now connected.
In 2015, there was still a positive response to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarettes and gum bats - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And that's when she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They had an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add to the portrait,” explained Dewey-Hagborg on opening a new exhibition.
However, visitors and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she would be interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her trapped muse were made available in two years through correspondence.
They even made a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoila Kanung, who presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea was missed and could take part in the exhibition in person.
President Obama has indeed asked for the release of Manning for a few days after the release of the comic book, which has been a welcome change after several inconclusive years in the military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition takes place at the time when Donald Trump is conducting a war with people who are seeking to publish government information and transgenic soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate his tweets in areas that should support.
In response to the question regarding this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “all things are happening for some reason. ”
Under a statement by an artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls for his huge signature (i - in the last name is a heart-crazed one) after the end of the self-representation, which is based on sex, race, sexuality and culture -
On the opposite side there is a sequence of her mitochondrial DNA - a stack of letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By classification of 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we are all.
“I hope that people will take it away, that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective, and everyone can interpret it after her,” said Dewey-Hagborg. In view of her work, Spurius Memorials from 2007 on the topic of the video.
“DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above-mentioned graphic amendment.
He displays Manning, which is based on King Kong's way from United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
“As soon as it prevents you from speaking, they will win,” it says.
‘Don’t ever shut up.
“It is a direct transcript from one of the letters,” said the Philadelphic artist.
“When I think about it, my skin is falling on, ” he says.
Manning hasn't visited the exhibition in person - which was foretold in a comic book - but when she does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, with her own genome resemblances, sorted as crowd Protestants.
That was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm tall statues of Maning, on which the pencils are recorded by its genetic haplogroup.
“In the past they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits.
“I wanted to impress a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and frees it.
Professor Sevwest University and employee of Oxford University looking for murder
In these days, a nationwide search takes place after Professor Sevezórna University and employees of Oxford University who are being prosecuted for suspicion of murder of a man who was found poor to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, the police said.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for the murder of the first degree on a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports Cook County's court file.
It says in the document that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police declared that the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
The police were informed on this fact by telephone. After arrival at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene and detectives investigate the case as a murder.
Lathem has been working as a member of the microbiology and immunology of the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem was now on administrative leave and was prohibited from entering the university.
“The entire matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the North West University fully cooperates with them,” said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
University speakers and Somerville College said in their statement sent by e-mail: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are prepared to assist the US police as well -
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished that they would report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of contact with the public of the Chicago Police Department, stated that he calls for suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
“The police have information on the location of their stay and the search for suspects is being stepped up,” said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that in search of suspects help local police, regional and nationwide authorities.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who was alerted to the events to be found in the apartment no. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as a very violent one.
Guglielmi said it's not clear whether the incident took place on July 27.
He added that Lath and Warren were caught by security cameras.
“We believe Professor Latham knew his victim, ” said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza headquarters issued a statement for all residents: “Police is now working on setting up a time overview and the profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.
“In the short future we will complete the plan of WADA - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mukko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not be long enough to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and reuscitation of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
\"Now part of the criteria for the new plan has been completed and the RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated,” said Mutko on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the RUSADA - which was recently published on the website of the organisation.
According to Mutka, the Code does not contain anything to concern Russia.
“All have been notified and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA at the nearest time, - added to this.
However, one of the above criteria calls on WADA's results from the investigation, which Richard McLaren investigated, to sponsor Russian athletes from the government.
Mukko said: “We are under investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
It was brought up to all measures.
But there were no state programs in our country, and so we cannot confess to something that has never existed.
The mutkava confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, the director of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview for the Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: “In many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to receive the report completely without reservation,” Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU from the delivery of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation has authorised planning and uniting testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit from the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, CEO of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that the RUSDA was “on the right path to renewal.
The police charged three people, one young man.
The police charged three men with the establishment of a fire of a rare wooden church in Třinci-Gutech on Frydecko-Menek.
One accused is youthful, all three are Czech nationalities.
They've been threatened for a criminal offence for up to 15 years.
The reporters today told the Moravian police director Tomáš Klupel.
He thought it was a deliberate crime.
“It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the theme of the whole matter,” Kžel said.
He said that the police would be dealing with possible custody of accused persons.
Further information cannot be published by the Director.
“So far, I cannot tell you because the workers of the criminal police and investigations and the state attorney who is in charge of the matter are actually working on matters,” Klupel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
He was a valuable monument with many original equipment and images from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will go according to the preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is uncalculated.
The fires after the fire began to reflect on the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should cover insurance, other costs are ready to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, and a public collection is also being prepared, and it is counted with the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local parish.
A similar wooden church of St. Kateřina from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed the fire fifteen years ago.
It caused the failure to install.
There was an exact copy in his place.
The state counts with citizens defending the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the actual intention of the law on the preparedness of citizens to defend the state is calculated.
The Ministry of Defense, which he has received for his task from the government, promises that he will thus be able to increase the physical usefulness of the Czech Republic and their ability to make use of it in crisis situations.
It's coming out of a motion prepared by the Ministry.
If the law was adopted in the future, the State would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of order.
According to his authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system to help increase the preparedness of the Czech people to defend the state, beyond the performance of their active duties and on the basis of voluntaryity.
For example, the state would either financially or material support the associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and allow them to increase the ability of their members.
In return, he would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country at the time of the crisis and on their ability or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help the associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also counts with the organisation of the discussions with war veterans or people who were heroic.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of administration and project coordination.
The authors of the draft stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their ability to make use of it after the declaration of danger.
The whole concept must respect the gradual prosecution of the earlier obvious borders between the different types of threats, - in its intention to refer to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministers noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest set of powers, not just the military ones.
“The basic objective of the intention is to create a very wide base that enables each citizen to respond effectively to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or life, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, to contribute to the protection of others, and to wrong conduct by not complaining to the tasks of the Czech Republic’s armed forces,” states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring little financial claims.
Their height will depend on the chosen variant according to the Ministry.
For example, the Authority foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If the administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to extend the scope of the regional military headquarters, which would jointly employ another 42 soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already said that the law should also help to resolve the disapproval of some Czech politicians with the implementation of the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive is responsible for.
Startups that your company will not help become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find an adequate survey.
Answers were often inseparable, useless, or even false.
And although she promised anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the whole process.
“I followed the consistency and objectivity,” said Errettová, the owner of the company of Hair Care Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, employing 75 people.
She therefore requested outside aid.
New startups in the field of human resources are constantly emerging in the market, which help society to explore the satisfaction of employees.
The creation and licensing of software with a specific intention of measuring employees' duties enable the company to carry out rapid voting, to target specific teams and demographic groups, and to offer a completeonymity of employees and a hot line to submit complaints, and in some cases they also allow the informants to bypass the superiors and contact the Director directly.
\"There are tools such as Strava and Fitbit that are watching your health condition, but where Fitbit is for your company,\" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint launch, based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glintu, she gained more awareness of what her employees think and how she feels in three years.
In addition to rapid surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a comprehensive overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low rating - allowing users to work on repair.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in the event that it would become another Uber - which is being rejected in the scandals after the former employee published a contribution to his blog describing the corporate environment and harassing employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups such as Glint, the demand for research of corporate culture represents an exclusive business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and complication can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convertercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps the company to prevent and reveal inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla include almost 600 of Convercent's clients.
He recently accepted Uber under his wings.
Like Glint, the company allows the Convertercent to send a customized “bles” survey, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
Where the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Board of Directors.
“The Court of Public opinion has authorised regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convercent launch.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if it does not cover regulators - it may face costly consequences as a result of the fight against customers, decommissioning of employees or judicial proceedings, it added Quinlan.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations uses Convertercent more than a year to increase the awareness of employees on corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to see a telephone number or an e-mail on the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope in an obvious solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, according to which previously there was no reliable way of tracking complaints from employees.
Now, when the company uses Convertercent, it is ensured quick detection and solving problems that have never been reached with managers sitting in offices, on miles away from the actual complaint solution - the purchase of discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It is a Dutch general view of the employee experience,” said Vitrano, who is managing the Ruby Tuesday group to monitor the risk management.
\"We also protect shareholders from judicial disputes by employees;
The companies ceased to take ethics, the values and participation of employees in light weight in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed after Enron’s fall in the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, said Quinlan.
But only when “the whole thing was lit up by social media, they began to realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
“ Before they began to use the ethics of technology, they relyed on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Convertercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold equity investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose 10 million dollars in his February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in total and finally took $47 million of capital.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising due to the mutual nature of society, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more than ever from their workplace.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to understand that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to society that is seeking a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employees’ benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convertent and Glint.
Investors are earning if companies and companies grow up to be satisfied with their employees.
And when a analytical instrument appears in the market to ensure the involvement and commitment of employees to society, there is no wonder that many investors who will support this effort will be found.
According to experts in working culture, it is important to have data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the data itself is free of charge if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and failure of employees.
“As soon as you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, the Director of Consulting at Kotter International, who was witnessing many companies that rely too much on the data itself.
“Because once things don’t go to the end, employees start asking the question: ‘Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if you don't, why should I care?
Madison Reed, currently regularly conducting a survey between employees every month, can solve the problem within one day, said Errett.
After the assembly of feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decisionmaking and the quality of communication, Errett managed to reorganise several teams within society and start training communication to the obvious solution of the problem.
Ruby Tuesday receives a very important view of his employees and hopes that it will achieve high employment in the field, which is known to be frequent releases in the long term.
“If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you,” Vitrano added.
\"And as soon as you lose your employees, you lose your customers.
And with the impact of customers, the whole company is breaking down -
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower, Hodonínsk, the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He passed that Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They informed the workers of the Czech hydrometeorology Institute.
On Thursday, but there were not many temperature records.
The heat was mainly hit by Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly clouded.
On Tuesday, there were overplayed or compared records to 35 of 145 meteorological stations over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
Perhaps today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
At Lednice, today’s 37.4 degrees, the original maximum exceeded four tens of degrees and in Pohorlice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the Watchtower of 2013.
High temperatures have appeared in the south and east of Moravia today.
After the Watchtower was the largest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojemsk and Brodá nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where the mercury fell well on 37.8 degrees, but the record failed.
On the other hand, for example, in Western and North West Bohemia, according to the Czech Republic, the highest temperatures of today were only around 22 degrees Celsia.
“Teplotypes started to grow there until later this afternoon,” said meteorologists.
The current heatlands in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear according to the Czech Republic, and on Sunday they could also come more pronounced rains.
Most of Morava's places remain high temperatures on Friday and the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
We've got such a mess here.
The billionaires don't have the same voice in elections as every single full - year - old man in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as serious as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, buy political parties.
Penty Marek Dospiva and other colleagues in the water of Martin Burdo and Antonín Fryčem sponsor Robejštva Realista.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of insurance and business in the real estates by Pavel Sehn, who is also its chairman.
The corrupt and king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, took the side of the private sector.
Agrofert's political movement, as Andrei Babiš's project wanted to name in addition to the Mayor of Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for himself.
The mayors recently caught their billionaires.
It's Dalibor Grandfather, the owner of the company at the Jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he goes into politics to do good.
Entree in the mayor's dressing, but Grandpa didn't do much.
“I have never had little goals,” he said at the press conference.
That means my goal is to make the ANO movement to win the Starost movement 20 percent in elections.
Leckdo was laughing.
The heir is more likely to be.
Billionary Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although it intends to address the voices of voters in the mayor's court, Andrei Babiš continues to support.
The grandfather was encouraged by Grandma in previous parliamentary elections.
“Babiš is not a shooting speaker and a non-governmentally lazy rhetoric of political snakes,” he wrote about him before 2013.
But it certainly does not go to politics because it would want to improve personally.
Grandma's gonna be a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his world, which he has under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he learned from his admiration to Babylon again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to cooperate with Babish.
Some may appreciate that a grandfather doesn't change his mind and stands behind his own no matter what he's wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babish is sending his baby to the mayors to build someone so infallible.
Others may ask whether the Head of Jablotron, for instance, did not break up in bad business with the boss of the Agrofert and seek no other way to defend himself with his business rival.
But the first Christmas Eve didn't just go around Babish.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors' campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult for anyone to stand up for a similar statement.
In the end, the judicialally recognized gauer Zdeněk Bakal, before the 2010 elections, was throwing millions on all sides.
The political division of the Security Agency Vita Barty, TOP 09 and civil Democrats came together to a total of 30 million.
But today is another time.
The law prohibits any political party giving more than three million.
Once Grandpa entered politics, he could at least have studied the rules of the game.
Maybe you wouldn't have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
Then Grandpa crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with higher education will come to about 50 grand each month.
Those with less than 20 basics.
A man with 50 grand here is rich.
The one with the twenty poor.
In a society’s vision of poor people, taxes are well paid and rich people enjoy benefits from the functioning of the social state in which they do not share too much.
The rich is simply needed to help them not to smother poverty with needy.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babish can hold their hands.
We too can confirm thanks to Grandpa that billionaires are not good people.
Then there's a question of who to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the State are not responsible for their employees and countries for their property.
And in the end, those who want to live well in a rich earth to all people, not just to some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have decreased by 234 million.
Real estate sales are sometimes not easy.
And he will often not help 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is selling the President of the USA Donald Trump.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down with an incredible 8 million pounds.
He reported on the Mirror.co.uk website.
In the brochure on the Land, it says: ‘By Saying, Donald J. Trump’
Avoid the place like no other.
However, even the connection between real estate companies and the US president did not defend an extreme price list.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean headquarters with an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price fell to £13 million.
Thus, even after a fine villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The charming seat of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The pool and tennis court are also part of the property.
Tens of fire are planted on the property.
From the terrace is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, it was shown that contact with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
Real estate was supposed to buy for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin Island.
But with a new price, it's a second place.
The irresistibleness in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
NCAA decided to end up with two trainings a day.
The 11th morning morning and American football players of UCLA University are about to go by the sideline of the new school field.
Some of them take their dressings and reveal their sweaty backs, the insignificant mark of the first day of the training camp.
For most of these team members, nothing's done in the afternoon.
Players registered in the summer semester will go to rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exam before they return to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place in the morning at 6:30.
“The next three days, these boys are gonna be a good makeover,” said Coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday went down on Tuesday.
Excluding two trainings on one day, the NCAA wants to relieve players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday when the final exam ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - so that they will be stuck in so many students' diaries.
For the first time in six seasons, which Mora spent at the position of coach in Westwood, Bruins will begin training camp one week earlier than last year and training is limited for the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one day.
There is a total of 18 trainings scheduled until August 20th, where formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, held in September.
Mora had heard that he supported the NCAA decision, although it added another item to the already charged player's diary.
“Th or four days, players are under great stress and it is very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
“But no one gave up, they all try.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down -
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which occupied players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal rod.
Players Bruins should have the hotel set up starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
“The land will guard the security service,” Mora added.
“The safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
It's a good deal of business with that material.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard security as well as parking No. 8.
We'll use our means to the maximum.
I believe everything will work out well.
Everything is planned.
Facebook plans to control facts more closely to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to third parties control and to show findings under original contributions in an effort to combat the so-called “face news”, said the largest social network on Thursday.
The company’s statement on its website writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible telexes, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under their original contributions.
Facebook was referred to as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these uncertained reports affected the election of President of the United States last year.
There are political debates in Europe. French voters are flooded by false reports on May's presidential elections, and Germany plans to make out fines on the social media network in advance of September's choices if it does not rapidly remove angerful contributions.
On Thursday, in his next statement in Germany, Facebook stated that he was about to launch a new control function for false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“For the purpose of displaying reports verified by third parties, people demand more content to be better informed and they can rightly decide what they can share,” said Sara Su, the company’s company’s company’s product intelligence manager Facebook.
It added that Facebook continues to test the function ‘related articles’ and also works on other changes in order to reduce the number of false reports.
Type of graphic amendment: story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotland Castle recently played a major role in Squeez's music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and the 1980s.
But Scotland was from his cozy place near the Bewl River in the British Kent witness to 700 years of stormy history, which inspired the Christian Jamie Rhodes from the York count - a famous delight in historical documents - to create graphic news.
“The look on the letter of a person who is 300 years after death is fascinating me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection.
The Grafical Novela A Castle in England documents the lives of families who have been staying in Scotland since the Middle Ages until Eduardov. Each story illustrates the different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Story (2014), a collection of inspired British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
“I was interested in the print of a letter written by a double agent in the 1970 ’ s who worked for Jakobita, ” he said.
“This is his finger print!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in that time you had to light a candle to read.
If I wait a letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How do I love archives -
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support by National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility to survive almost four months in the castle as a dream. (To be true, I have extended my stay a little.)
Rhodes spent time studying the Victorian “new” castle, browsing archives and studying many treasures and kuriozite, such as the head of hyena on the wall and bottles, which have been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He was walking around the property and exploring the ruins of the old castle, talking to the firemen, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
In the night, “he drank whiskey and wrote“
Scotney's trust stories are relatively largely unknown as National Trust gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of her last heir Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the place ten years later, the employees began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as “aristocracy many centuries excite with their hands with the words:“Take it into the attic.”
The journals, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting possessions: “You may think the dispute about the land is boring,” said Rhodes, “but I ran into one case when two families were stretching over the burden.
Stop it, people.
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflective bridge and are much deeper into English history, including the story called The Labourer, which follows the man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English rebellion in 1381.
“I found a record of the rebellion in the castle from 1380, which was called Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex,” said Rhodes.
“In fact, an English rebellion began in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Perhaps something is related in the end.
Other stories are firmly associated with the history of the castle - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whose family was hiding Darrell's family for seven years during the English reform.
Or The Smuggler on a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled out a stone coffin (which was found only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell: “I was interested in male generations - these men were always debted and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family have dealt with this by taking on a rich or old lady - I imagine it was the handsome gentlemen who would like to wash their heads with the heirs -
With the end of his stay on the castle looking for Rhodes after other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week strike in Finnish wilderness, where he had inspired his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotland.
“ I was sad when I left, ” he said.
\"I was like, \"Now I'm going back to real life.\"
Washington changes the terms of awarding green cards
Media published the words of President Donald Trump on the new U.S. immigration plan, which also leads to a change in the award of a green card.
It is expected that the number of legal immigrants will fall by 50,000 annually as a result of more stringent rules for the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules propose the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers of taxes, and we will learn to change the rules for issuing green cards to the residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process of the preferred English speaking applicant, who pour out funding and prove the ability to benefit our country, says Trump, quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be careful.
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, there's a report on the Internet about the technological development of sex robots.
Yes.
The sexual robots are currently really popular.
Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of workers and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noela Sharpy, it is necessary to look at the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, shape of the chinks and look of the nails robot.
“ People are pulling them off, but sales are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them more often,” said Sharpe on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from an inflatable master to a robot woman with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm on touch - of course is an artificial intelligence that imitates human behavior.
The user can “correct the robot from the color of the eyes and shape of the chin to the look and color of the nails.
However, it is very worrying that many robots have their own “personality,” which would shame Stepford’s mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robot women with silicone skin.
The owner of the robot RealBotix can set up his replacement wife's various character features, including their shyness.
And then there is a sex robot woman Roxxy Gold from True Companion, who is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including “the original Farrah, which is characterised by a shy nature and“ the wild Wendy, with“ nature - nature.
“ Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to suit your personality as far as possible,” says True Companion’s website.
She likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
Can be tired, call or “in the mood”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a few reasons - among which there is no exchange for real interhuman relations. The worrying are rather subordinate women's characters and violent insults - e.g. frigidic (four shocking) Farrah.
True Companion resembles Roxxy to a male vibrator on its website.
“If a woman could have a vibrator, why he could not have a man of Roxxxy, ” he says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just fetish or sexual aid.
Their origin and almost perfect sophisticatedness point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - moving away from ideal or sexual equality towards desire for subliming sex with an optional bump.
Of course, most men do not buy a working woman and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain at the edge of the general public interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror that is currently set today.
And most people are not homicidal or violent until they have a free market to do so.
There is no possibility that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world acquire their rights and in the White House they sit the President who expresses himself very shamefully at the woman's address.
The most extensive aspect of the series The story of the maid is not what we see - the hanged bodies and the missing eyes, such as the reality of these visions.
The book forecast The story of the maid represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots are to be as much like true women as possible (the case with the rates of pornkers).
Their creators build them so that they are pleasant to touch and work at first sight as a true woman.
But when it comes to their “personality, the robot cannot replace a true woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They don't have any work or history, anything that would stimulate their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
It says 21st century: maids.
The NBA star on the green arm.
Curry's fighting for a cut in California.
Stephen Curry's star basketball player, despite the first hit off at the premiere start, did not lose between professional golfers.
Double award holder for the most useful NBA player played on the Ellie Mae Classic below the Web.com Tour series in the California Hayward first round on 74 mornings and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second title with the Warriors team in NBA this season, began very nervous and his first fire ended up in a drink holder parked in a golf cart near Fairway.
Even after that, he wasn't as exact as under basketball basket as he did, yet he left dozens of professionals with a balance of four wounds above the couple.
“It was not the ideal way to start, he had to call the referee first, but then a little saddle,” Curry said, with the fact that he had a huge edge.
It was very nervous, to blow the first punch on the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
\"If you were to tell me that I would play 74 in the first round, I would immediately do it,\" he said.
If Currym manages to fight the cut, which will probably be determined by two shots below the steam, it will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on Web.com Tour.
“I want to play better next time and now that I have lost my training, perhaps it will go,” said an overrated golfer who had already played celebrit and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
She starts at Hayward for the first time at the PGA tournament.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsoring exception and maintained his amateur status.
The series Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's great victory?
That's why Mitt Romney's agitated by a healthy sense of reason.
The unbelievably sign of Trump's era is becoming political diaphragms that divide America's voters and in micro scale they also rip off the whole family.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper reported it with advice on how to deal with relatives who elect Trumpa.
Well, we're just waiting for them to let us get nervous.
However, less attention is given to Trump’s ability to stifle the family.
I'm talking about it because she visited me this week in New York, my cousin - poet and fan of the left, who lives in Chicago and who has paid for a long time in our family for the Republican crowd.
She reminded me that the semnutity face to face the common enemy could have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump at the White House, all of a sudden, there is a whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom she had been suffocating about politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm surprised that this poses a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we are talking about “normalization,” and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that his Shachanicals may lose their attractiveness one day.
However, there is an even more terrible long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes“ the right-wing Republicans, who, by resisting its standards, will suddenly be emphatizing what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in the heart of my memory of Mitt Romney and his version of a crazy act - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (but we had a conscience about his tax confession) - both of which both examples look like a very mild obstacle compared to Trump.
After Trumpa leaves, it will be sufficient for a subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We have used visits to my cousin and we have taken the children to Central Park on the largest collector operating in the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you will not find better use if you do not need caffeine.
Horses are huge, medium cylinder is covered with glassamines - clowns and animals are filming and in a terrible view of their own shoulders - a completely gloomy view and glamorous music resembles public transport.
The vast cliché soon freezes: the view from the higher buildings, the panorama looks around, instead of breathing at you by the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
About twenty years later, I still haven't moved through the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - it does not count the thematic economy of Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the subway station in London.
However, the coloiter in Central Park has a remarkable magical experience, to the point that two two two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women are having a great time at it.
If I could evaluate, he would deserve the highest points, but no one is asking fortunately.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in the shop when I was asked to pay my credit card to evaluate my ‘ experience’ on a scale from one to five.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, with the difference that I can add 15% of the tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down any other rapid sale, but the waitress is forced to get so into the shoppers when it is not needed.
My wife at the store apologized to me with a smile when I failed to value my passing credit cards with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated due to cutting wounds on the wrist, which, according to the statement of the prison, caused himself after the fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original death sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in early morning hours on Valentine's day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet closet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he was wrong about the thief.
The defendants announced their intention to re-election, this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius, which, according to their words, is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the hearing would take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius threatens to extend the sentence to up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in the history, she gave birth to a young man in the captivity of a buried panda, who slept in the wilderness.
It's a huge success for a program to save the Pand.
The Centre is trying to expand the phenophone of the panda buried in captivity.
The center worker Čang Č-čung told New China that the breed of the peds is at great risk from the obscene crossroads.
Only 471 peds lived at the end of last year.
There are only two thousand survivors in the open nature.
Trying to let the captured panda with those wild ones be the first step to help the panda keep this species safe.
The 15th Cchao-cchao was released into the natural reserve at the beginning of the burning period on 11 March.
Thanks to the surveillance device on the neck, scientists could see every step of it.
She met her chosen Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The male sex with the male has lasted one minute and a half, and it's successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because the males are not considered to be the most successful lover of the animal empire.
In addition, males are often confused and have no idea what to do.
Youth was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it weighed after the birth of 216 grams.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, quoted the bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was held on August 1st in the morning of the Sithanian Police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continued.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught on the spot where camping is not allowed.
The checks will take place all season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose fines.
The pin is on the first round of British Open in 50th place.
Golfist Klára Spilková presents after the first round of Major British Open in a divided 50th place.
The heat in the Scottish Kingsbarns covered the score one hit below the par when she played three bigies and twice the bogey.
The twenty-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that he will pass through the famous Major for the first time.
The entry into the competition with a donation of $3.25 million went best to the American star Michelle Wieová, who won the first round in the 64-page record game, i.e. eight under steam.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands withdraw millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already closed 180 poultry because of the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority, according to the company Reuters, announced that it investigated 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which it considers that 80 percent of eggs on the market are invalid.
The Authority pointed out that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs recognised by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the number of toxic substances in eggs is small and, for adults, there is no danger, however, the potential threat is for children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities joined even for breeding, have not recently imported themselves to the Czech Republic.
However, vets will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in whose markets the problems of insecticide appear.
In the Czech market, eggs from the Netherlands were last in April and last in May, according to the veterinary administration of Belgium.
Chicken meat from Belgium was last discovered in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers WHO to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga's beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, say the goalman Sedláček, looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
“I will return there once,” Sedlaáček, the 27 - year - old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlínský dres.
Depends on whether he gets an engagement at the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it like I was at school, three times.
I didn't catch much of a first year, I had an experienced goalman ahead of me.
I've been studying.
The second year I began to catch.
Third season I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalman I was dealing with again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch up all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only got five points, so the trainers started to spin.
At the end, my colleague was caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was life in Rize?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are gentlemen like us or a Slovak who must change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other hand, so you have to replace it.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem around the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
The coin shoots, and even if they have a half-end goal ahead, they'd rather record it.
In the Czech Republic, there is more to be shot.
Didn't it make you a travel problem and move over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done by playing like four games outside, and then you have two days off.
How do the lotys even see their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball is national sports.
All of them.
Even though it didn't work, there were a lot of people.
Is Dinama's influence in KHL helping to make Latvia at the world championship this year?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time they started to go up to the world championship.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterly with Canada just 1:2.
That was an amazing result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts was appointed in Zlín and before the contract was signed, Ralfs Freibergs.
What do you mean, there's so many coming here?
They're no bet players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotyshi is among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL has begun in three weeks.
Why are you still in trouble?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't be going on in Riza.
That's what we started looking for.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget on a goalman, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but in the finals, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and waiting for something to happen.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That was four years ago when I left and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not best, on the other hand I'm at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it another time.
The only question is when and where I sign it.
How real is the variant that you're going to run a new year in Zlín?
Anything could happen.
We'll see what happens next month, where everything's going to go.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to talk to you.
Do you prefer any competition?
The past season wasn't so I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government flight at Let continues.
In January this year, I wrote an article with a proper housekeeper, including a camp in Letech near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to remember the difficult passage of the article.
They've been talking about camp in Letech for years.
For readers who don't exactly know what's going on, it'll probably be best if they look for, for example, the official site of the cultural monuments of the Pietní place Leta.
There, in the opening of the historical overview, it was found that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8.8. 1940 he served as a work camp, from 1. 1942 he was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 he became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were included in Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transporting the largest transport to the extermination camp.
Total of them was 420.
A very sad history of the enormous hardships of human beings, which caused them to be human beings again and a perverted ideology.
It is not disputed that these events must be constantly remembered.
It is neither disputed nor that this reminder should take place at the memorial site of the experienced suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism, some kind of forgot about the camp, and in the 1970s he was near and built in part of the former camp.
History of the camp accidentally discovered in 1992 an American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was discovered in Letech.
In the middle of the 1990s, the government promised to buy and destroy a widow, but it hasn't happened yet.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration fell under the Memorial of Lidice.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close its home.
So briefly the facts of the postwar fate of the camp.
After last autumn, the government approved the buy-in and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy a drink.
According to the Minister of Culture, the numbers exist, but I would probably make those intentions if I went to the public with them.
Let's see what a professional assessment brings.
According to some informal estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to billions.
It's not gonna be cheap in any way.
However, only a few hundred metres from the former camp is the monument to which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were to be financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which I believe would probably not be a threat, it would be the same thing to throw away money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a decent place of care, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragic tragedy and whoever wants, there may be a memory of the suffering and murdered.
I can't see any reason to change this!
Let's just leave it as it is, and keep the perfect place with maximum care.
The entrusted property, i.e. the money of taxpayers, should be responsible, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, treat the caretaker of the proper economy.
At least with a guy like you in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But even so, I see the password of the ANO leader in the above mentioned facts as an empty pre-election.
I took a look at the place this May.
Very decent arrival path, modified parking, replicas of wooden camp bars.
In one exposure, in the second integrated WC with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and looking at its own warm spot, which is made from stones located in a mild slope.
A lot of flowers and donkeys.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place as it looks and belongs.
It is currently taking place at the site of the original camp archaeological research.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible for example to book a part of the uncovered bases and at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, Minister Daniel Herman could make his efforts.
In the event that he will manage to buy the money from the government, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic work in the function of the Minister of Culture.

For your application system, red meat and dairy products may be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal proteins and dairy products could help to relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
Untreatmentable disease affecting up to 1.3 million U.S. population and 300 000 patients in the UK causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded that they do not use meat and milk products to reduce symptoms. However, researchers in Washington University have found that the essential amino acid trieptophane contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna's lead study explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are removed from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without harming the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the skull of the neck leans on the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of research, scientists discovered the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria require cell formation of trieptophane - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestine microbiom and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptonates had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells -
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and diets rich in trieptophane helped develop a more harmful and less inflammatory intestine environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas found that one group of test mice had these cells while the other group of the same mouse kept separate cells lacked.
One group of mice has different intestine microbioms - bacteria, viruses and fungus that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse shake was tested by the method of listing DNA and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked the second mouse group.
So the mice that were kept in the sterile environment and lacked their intestine microbiom - did not develop this kind of immune cells - were administered by L. reuteri bacteria - and they created immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - the unexploited immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immunity cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
Following removal of the active components from the fluid, it has been shown to be a by-product of trieptophane metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us store L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether L. reuteri by side products caused cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes associated with trieptophane have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the intestines.
Potentially high trieptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the population of the cells -
José Mourinho considers the signature of the contract with Nemanje Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be a “genial”
Manchester United won into his team “the genius, in the form of Nemanja Matia, at least he thinks José Mourinho after the supporter debuted in the Wednesday fight against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the agreement for £40 million, stated in the first match of prize 2:1 in Dublin - the last presiding game before the EUFA Supergaming, where the United encounters on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and impressed in his role as a supporter on the side of Paul Pogby and Andrea Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team presesonic Asian tour, Matić did not have a form and played only 45 minutes on which, according to Mourinha, the next Premier League season should be processed before the beginning of the next season.
“He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent, and he has genius thinking - he thinks football,“ said Mourinho.
“We will help him to get into the condition as soon as possible ?
Like Matić, his new co-founders Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukaku also played the first game on Aviva Stadium and Mourinho begin to slowly form their eleven for another season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourinho wanted to continue to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did a “fantistic job” and brought three of the top four players into the team.
\"Thank the club for helping me get three of four players,\" he added.
\"Four four would have pleased me more, but I acknowledge they have made me the maximum--
The life challenge of the King's chicken skin Ladi Hručky.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The many-merciful picture began to shine thanks to the new TV series of Prima Zdeňkov Academy.
The game immediately covered the chance.
\"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to sign up to your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you,\" said him in the video on the social network.
And since those two have been squeezing for several years, they haven't forgotten to hit him this time.
“I can teach you from dietary chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to water and show you why it is a popular fried cheese,” Hruška said.
They're serious about their participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
\"The question is what the boss said,\" said Lightning.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he filmed the new parts of his next show Yes, chef!.
Only Prima responded to the participation of Hručky in the culinary Academy, with the fact that the whole matter takes as his personal activity that goes outside the TV.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich founded his first cook.
Over 300 thousand pieces have been sold to her within a few days!
The new show presented yesterday by Prima at the press conference on autumn's broadcast schedule is an unfamiliar cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from a series of viewers, and in 12 works he will familiarize them with 12 cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk at his back had his trick ironed over his chest.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
“In the case of the pear, I only laugh - the chest is healthy fruit and has lots of vitamins,“ it reacted to Lada.
He's thinking about Láď's culinary art.
“Father according to Ladi Hruki, I do not consider at home, because I do not let go of the gastropunk,” my boss says.
I appreciate Zdenek Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
But his prescriptions will certainly not appear on my show, - you did not forgive Hruška.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook to me, he's a TV clown.
“Gastronomic analfabet or moron,” said Pohlreich about Hrušk in one lecture.
“I’m not 20 to be able to wave hands over them, but I don’t care about them anymore,” said Hruška.
The British inventor uses microchip in his hand to wash the car and the house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip put into the body. A simple wave of hand can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Steven Northam's 13-year-old had a small chip implanted between his thumb and the fingerboard and currently offers the same service through its BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist of the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
Technology works on the same principle as microchip implanted dogs and cats and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also offers a service to exchange door locks and cars compatible with microchip. The price of one castle is £300.
A married father of one child had the technology to integrate into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which started with a simple hand wave.
The revision of the White House cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The decision of the White House to fly with the helicopter of the Navy to South Lawn on the occasion of the celebration of the American manufacturing industry, held last month, came according to the records of the Navy issued by TIME for $24 000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of President on board, was the top of the program on July 17 in the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several high officials of the White House were watching a show of products from all 50 states.
Helicopter from Connecticut was exposed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The Military Officer of the White House issued a fragmented order or FRAGO and requested that helicopters be present less than 36 hours before the landing of helicopters on South Lawn under the “micron” event, reports Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of helicopters.
“I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such important events,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to your superior officer, deputy commander of the Navy on the day before the opening of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17, around 7:00 to the occasion of the show, whose beginning is scheduled for 15:00 and remain on site until the entire area was fully cleared, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail further said that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return years due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew remained on site that night, along with the helicopter and along with them the security staff unit.
From the records that TIME received - it was not visible whether the second crew was finally sent.
Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were assured it was all right,” the commander wrote.
\"It sounds like you're blocked,\" said the deputy commander.
This “Made in America” show was marked as an official event by the White House, and Hatch Act would therefore not look at it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in events, the President promoted a medical reform that was going through the Senate and spoke about an effort to maintain government regulations.
The use of air means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use it when travelling.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered control in February after the presidential plane went underground at his first meeting in the ground of Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is covered by complaints about the use of the president's predecessor.
“The White House is pleased with the show “Made in America”, which presented products from all 50 states producing Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, the press secretary.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train any arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump participated in the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The summer at the Made in America show was part of the current crew training, said the state factor.
On the same day, the helicopter unit sailed under the “non-president support missions - another eleven hours.
The White House stated that no further requisition was taken from taxpayers' money.
Mr Sikorsky stated that the company was not interested in the negotiations on the exposure of helicopters to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and precise costs in connection with the show are difficult to determine according to the statement of the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is EUR 24 380 per flight hour, the refund for the expenditure of the DoD for VH-3D.
Units record 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argued that the actual operating costs of helicopters are largely below the said amount.
‘The cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading,’ Walters said the whole thing.
‘These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs;
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation for DoD expenditure does not include costs for personnel but includes the price of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer advocated the use of helicopters for the purposes of the show.
“The idea of a show that takes place this week is to introduce products produced in the USA,” said Spicer.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not to thousands of people.
I think, just like most Americans, that we are proud of helicopters and other military equipment in which the countless American citizens participate.
This fact is to be recalled:
It is unclear whether Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his visit to South Lawn. It is obvious that only one of the fire cars was seated behind the wheel.
Back in the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
“ I know Sikorsky very well, ” the President said, “I own my own three immediately.
A young woman was caught in a swamp near Machha Lake, and the police were brooding to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about two hours early.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in wetlands.
When she decided to ask her mobile phone to help the police, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her,\" said the police spokesperson Ivan Balák.
A place she described, a few police guards went out, but finding a young woman wasn't easy at all.
“ Some of the police had to prowl a hundred meters before they felt solid ground under their feet,” Baláková approached.
And she was also missing.
According to which direction her call for help came out.
To avoid at least this connection, they agreed to count on it in a loud manner,” said the spokesperson.
The police found a woman in the area of Bornne in three quarters.
She was on the edge of physical and mental forces and saw signs of underheating.
That's why she was transferred to a Czech hospital.
Grandpa's connection to the STAN?
A wanted bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little irony.
With his web project, searchameslusny.cz as a billionaire to voters essentially say that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically unnatural party of less known mayors and independents actually does not have any national program for the House's elections.
Her electoral candidate, just after interviewing Grandpa, becomes a decent person, whatever political opinion he has.
At one time, Vit Bart started this way, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition to his desire for decent people and personality, which will also replace certain mayors, which also allows Gazdík to cancel the popular argument of Chef STAN, that the biggest value of the movement is just politically verified and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and according to surveys.
Now, they're just about to clear up a bunch of unfaithful personalities.
The total breakup with the people who changed the logo and the slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the human beings.
But if the Stan of identity suspected only a few of them back then, after the arrival of Grandpa, he'll end up playing a game of identity.
Not only Gazdík has long been opposed to ANO Andrei Babish, but the grandfather who publicly praises Babiš stated: ‘My goal is to make the movement of ANO, the Starost movement is to gain 20 percent in the coming elections.’
Let's hope you didn't get mixed up.
Grandpa's a successful businessman and there's no way a billionaire is.
He often talks about politics like Babish, unlike him, but he does not become his own political mark.
STAN has been likes reality shows for a while rather than a real political side, and Grandpa's hand is as if she's even more of a wanted bride to be a sales girl.
SAN went out with TOP 09 for a while, then with the human beings, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Hopefully someone's coming in.
Police dogs practiced helicopters in Mostu
Dogs specialised in searching for explosives and dog search were trained at Lake Most by helicopters.
The police dog must not be fearless and be afraid of flying, said the Head of Police cynologists of the Ústeck Region Petr Tomášek.
The police dog training lasts about two years.
At Most, they practiced both adult dogs and those who only pass through training.
In addition to the standard training in which they had to reveal sharp samples of explosives around the lake and look for the lost figurant, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
In order for the helicopter to arrive immediately, the dog could go to work so that the helicopter doesn't have a problem.
The helicopter, the dog is coming and looking immediately, said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or on the way a helicopter is unable to start working immediately is removed from training.
“All of them leave them in the garden, for example,” Tommy added.
Police have 76 dogs in the U.S. Region with various specialties.
There are German sheep, but there are also Belgian sheep.
The poodle takes care of him from the puppy.
“He raises him himself, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us,” Tommy added.
The animals undergo repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal possible health Hendikeps.
If the dog is healthy and unfaithful, it consists of the first tests in 20 months.
“The sharp intervention takes about two and a half to three years,” Tommy added.
The length of the service at the police depends on the health condition of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live in their poodles.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy relys on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of the society, including women, are involved, said at the center of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the UN Aid Mission, said that the election to local representatives is taking part in hundreds of women, three women are asked to post Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in his midterm statement.
Options may be fully representative and credible only if they are involved in both women and women, as well as any related processes that relate to the choices.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
Taliban published several threats against the election process, which shifts international fighting activity to the second track.
In this year's elections, for the first time, one democratically elected government gives its power to a peacefully following government.
Haysom said that women's strong role would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Afghán's independent election committee stated that a total of 3.6 million registered voters account for 1.2 million women.
The unique brewer cooks beer again.
For a good beer in the rectreaded basement.
The enthusiasm and honesty of new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a beer shop in Lobč near Mšen.
The beer used for the first time in 1586 has a renaissance core and in the 19th century it was rebuilt into steam management.
The years followed were years of blooming when the beer shop was famous mainly by dark beer.
Unfortunately, during World War II the production was stopped and in 1984 the beer industry was born.
Since then, they've served the buildings of the state ship.
The amount of destruction was made by the owners of the basement after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and disassembled on building material.
In 2007, however, new hopes were displayed in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzová.
These buildings began to repair with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They devoted carefully to the study of archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The beer machine has the same shape as in the 19th century when its golden era started.
Their work was valued by the statement of the Centre's cultural monument to the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European industrial heritage path.
In 2015 they also celebrated the tradition of cooking beer.
If you want to taste a great lobèse beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the equipment in the area of the basement.
When cooking beer here, cocoin water is used in a protected landscape area, fresh from the lobcean fields and the Chechnya hops.
In the workshop you taste a traditional light lie, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the basement, take place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and midnight.
The biggest artillery receipt of Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest strengths of its type in the global scale?
Such a unique building was supposed to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was meant to form up to 12 large-scale bunkers.
There was supposed to be headquarters, a casino, ammo warehouses, material, power plant, machinery and hospital.
The construction, however, ended the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, he was able to build one massive iron bunker and to break underground spaces.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Spół Stachelberg, who started to rebuild a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The ground floor has already been made up of 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 skewer with exposure and ground and armed object of light attachment, there are two built-up speed screws, digs and ski trails of the Opole Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy altánek and wonderful views to the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech construction came to the list next to such monuments, such as the Great China Wall, the Traian port at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Ninive and Nimrudu.
Klášter Chotìšov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which today is a powerful four-wing building of the convention over a beautiful garden.
The list that he got to but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are at risk of leaking.
But they don't want to give up, and they do a lot of work to support the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the evening for the monastery Chotěšov this Saturday August 5th where they will go. Vladimír Mishik, Ivan Vod, you will see the Swiss performances and look at places of beautiful vast buildings that are usually unavailable.
But you're enjoying the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look at the Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Moravian Museum in Brno appeals to the quietest freshener until the Stone Age, to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals have been able to cope perfectly with various extreme climate conditions, especially with the alteration of ice and interlocking times.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn how they looked like their anatomy, technological skills and hunting um, but also their aesthetic sensation.
That you wouldn't say that to the Neanderthals?
Let me convince you in Brno.
The 14th KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday Friday at Veveří Castle.
In addition to the great music you will see building a Celtic village, you will try the Celtic way of life including crafts, games for children and adults, incarnation, magic or ritual painting on the body.
La Quadrill will not be missed with Irish and Scottish dances, bubenic jamming, a game of dudy and an amazing fireworks surprise in the submission of Carpe Note.
How tasty is Moravskoslezsko?
The seventh year of the known gastrofestval How to taste Moravia is held on Saturday 5th August 2017 in the area of the Karlova Studánka mountain spa.
Cook will be chef Miroslav Kalina, taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, Grey competition trail and of course many competitions.
Know the plant with one click.
Students with the production of herbaries and ordinary plant lovers will help new free application Pl@ntNet.
If they're interested in what plant they've just encountered, this application will advise them.
All they have to do is photograph the plant and the application will know what kind of species it is.
A new application that is available for iOS and Android was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centres in the Bratislava Horsky Park in the City's Secret Life Project.
The project also included pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the site Secret City Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognise.
“The children who hold a tablet or phone in hand can go to the forest,” said the coordinator of this project Ivan Poláčková.
Based on sufficient quality photos of flower, leaf or plant fruit, the application can recognize its name, which will then be added to the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application to Slovak and Czech.
It is therefore welcome that users, after setting up the account, contribute to the image of the plant that is not yet present in the database.
“The French will assess if it is beneficial and then add it to the database,” Poláčková informed.
GMB concerns about the investment in McVie's factory in Glasgow
The Departments require insurance from managers of McVitie's dryer manufacturer about the long-term commitment of production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish GMB union stated that the company would, for the time being, be silent about any investment in the factory in Tollcross.
There are more than 500 employees working in the factory who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McViti's, Pladis, said that it invested more than £5 million in the whole area over the previous few years.
She added that the employees and representatives of the trade unions would be “the first informed, in the case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In their letter of construction, the Scottish authorities expressed their concerns that McVitie's “will not receive their promises to finance and modernise production lines.
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the builder about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Many families and employees have worked here mostly from the local community and the Glasgow region, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the field of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, wages and prosperity - and despite the view of Brexit, rising life costs and decreasing slow production - it needs the eastern part of Glasgow desperately prosperous producer such as McVite's -
The spokesperson of Pladis said: “The Tollcross branch received a letter from the GMB only yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value the continuing commitment to employees and union representatives.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many problems were discussed openly at this meeting.
We have talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which pays for all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross region, especially in production lines and in operational efficiency.
We greatly value the heritage of Tollcross and the local location and, in the case of any changes in the operation of the factory here, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be immediately informed -
Did Barcelona's PSG warn about Neymar's shift three years ago?
La Liga may regret his concern for Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to be acquired on her side after she deposited PLN 189 million, i.e. the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but warned the French team of Barcelona about its record raid three years ago?
The Ligue 1 Club is ready to overcome more than double the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid £89 million for it last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive player and the world's best paid professional athletes - after tax, it will be collected from the PSG team over £500 000 per week.
Barcelona is indigestion in a way that Neymar made himself out of his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to comply with Neymar from his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world pointed out to this fact three years ago by President PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that should be interested in preventing one of the best PSG players.
“I have no fear, because once someone tries to get one of our players, we will certainly address one of their players,” said Al-Khelaifi.
\"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have crossed its final line when it expressed interest in the covert PSG Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will the Italian representative be allowed to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona in its bold negotiations now with Neymar's left with a bitter pill.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have a wide understanding of rules?
Donald Trump had a fight against the Russian sanctions.
The United States applied sanctions on the Venezuelan President Madura the day before.
And one day before, Trump wrote that China was not doing anything to the North Korean threat and that it was not going to go on like that.
Even that makes him think of sanctions as shoe straw.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Madura's Venezuela really went on her way to the dictatorship, but totality.
China is not just as the US president wishes.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum up all of this so that even a regular caller, American, European or otherwise, he understood what it is and what system of rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump merely attracts what President Obama had already prepared, but he gave it an implementing stamp.
Then why such a mess?
Last year Europe was terrified that if the US elections win Trump, let us deal with Putin and withdraw sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
But it's the opposite of practice.
The sanctions are not released with Trump, but they're making it harder.
But Europe scares itself even more.
German Secretary Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
What, like, a kosher are just sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council?
But then there are neither kosher nor EU anti-EU sanctions.
The head of the European Commission, Juncker, complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean they're supposed to be using sanctions just as weak as they don't threaten anyone?
The usual voter's on.
Three years have he heard that the fate of the anti-EU sanctions depends solely on the fulfilment of the Mining Agreements on peace in Ukraine.
It now learns that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voters are pumping and spreading.
There are sanctions in Russia for too much montage to where he doesn't have.
China is skinny for dealing with little.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship at the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationale.
But does anyone see a system, a order or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, perjuring the Republic with his visionary book and finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubic region, all candidates have already been completed.
According to his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian authorities and the shadow minister of education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
However, if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a captain, - confirmed his previous opinion by Babish.
Many representatives and national politicians have upset your aunt that directly elected mayors and mayors should drive municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are voting directly to the President, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about the interference of the representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many will be there.
In the presentation of your book, I happen to sleep, I heard on my own ears that you spoke about the cancellation of the representative.
I don't remember.
I was talking about choosing directly and reducing the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1,2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor's estimate is that she doesn't build a lot of projects, but she doesn't have a competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people, Klaus, and Zeman were following in our history.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current Prime Minister is not following anything, but he's just a moderating the debate.
Then it can't work.
Is that why you want to run the majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to plant.
We only have a change in the program for a single-wheel choice to the Senate.
We have also proposed the proposed mandate of ministers and the revision of the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to prevent the unnecessary exhibition of members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be presented at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destruct the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will manage the government, control the Chamber with 101 Members, cancel the countries and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors, you will control the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron reported a reduction in the legislative congregation on the third, while there is 57 000 French on one legislator, while it comes to 17 000 Czechs.
But no one blames Macron for the threat of democracy.
Even if someone won the election most in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The forums for who has a parliamentary majority are but great, just look into Poland or Hungary.
There's no such thing as an ANO movement.
We just need a team to work for people in government, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree to raise only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services.
Why have they voted me over and added 21 percent to the GIBs who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you be the prime minister to do that?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave incomparably, they are involved in the government with travel agencies and, for the money of the state, they would like to do as Marian Jureka who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers don't have a fight in the government, they're supposed to talk outside of it.
There's no room for coalition breakup, a strong vote and a deal to decide.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers are acting mainly party?
There's a constitutional law over the sides.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition contract was not paying, and Babylon left the government.
That's what every Prime Minister can do.
But if there is a personality and has control skills, similar plans do not need a gesture.
It measure everyone the same way, and it requires perfect performance from everyone.
You know who you'd suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't even be in that government, no one wants to work with us, even if I don't know what I've done so bad.
That's not much of a whisper.
The mayors have acquired a grandfather who would like to cooperate with you, with the people who may win the wing of your inclined Jiří Chunka.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out the coalition with ANO, in ODS it may be possible to plant Václav Klaus ml.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Vice-President and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the economy.
So the mockers come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of the Vita Bárta behind the VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, he ran a puddle there.
Of course, he's a distinctive person.
Kind of brown though.
If I take his program, he has a wide range of people in management of society, direct democracy, that can be agreed.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if there's an acceptable person for you who has xenophobic opinions, speech on demonstrations with gallows and wants to step out of the EU?
We don't consider cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went to politics to benefit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists of your minority government?
I can't imagine it, but I can't imagine it.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the other in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the double.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on the coalition government program.
Let's go back to your effort to drive as a company.
But the government just has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, never decided.
Coalition issues such as ČEB or EEGAP have not worked.
Sobotka's his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did that, ČEZ ruled the Czech government.
However, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has brought resolutions written by CEZ management, which imposes the Minister's finances on how to vote at the general meeting of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the personnel ratios in the Supervisory Board and change the top management of CEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm the Prime Minister, we'll see each other.
I'm not him yet.
It's funny that ČEZ has already sent your signals.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with ANO.
Well, maybe after the election, it'll all go again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any lobbyist of Pokorny or Rose, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not even saying that.
Then answer directly.
If you stand in the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of CEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, then the institutions you criticize?
I'd like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, and that's what I'm going to do for traditional political parties.
It's enough to keep an eye on Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to stand in CEZ Majority, he never drove him, he was only in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivia matter to me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, order them to finance, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech TV?
Some of her shows run a permanent target campaign against me, but I don't have one, and I'm not gonna have anyone to throw away.
But control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay approximately 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't actually know how these institutions are running.
How come they don't know?
The House, however, approves the report on their management, which directly affects the position of CEOs of ČT and the Czech Republic.
Look at the news they're discussing, the super-powered Saturday Kalousek pact that's always worked.
It pays for both the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation files, and for lex Babis.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push me out of the government, which played a percentage of TOP 09, but ČSSD took them away.
They're afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and so they're talking about threatening Babylon's democracy.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first Vice-President ANO Jaroslav Faltínek builds power facilities by bringing his son into the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and orders the related lawyer Květoslav Hlin to contracts with municipal and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We have a permanent dispute in this.
I don't like it, and I've been counting on him a few times.
Faltinek argues that the mentioned lawyer is working at significantly lower rates and reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
I didn't have anyone as Minister of Finance.
We, unlike the Socans, never had a corruption affair, no Peltu, Kratochvílová, March.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our place, we immediately threw that guy out.
In this respect, I'm inconvenient.
If something like this happened, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
