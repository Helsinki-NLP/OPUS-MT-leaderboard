Eight-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Store.
The 18th-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco recently arrived was this week the stairs of local business.
But the victim’s brother says that he does not think he would want to hurt him, and he adds: “In the end, he has begun to fail.
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eight-year-old citizen of San Francisco Frank Galicia.
The Sanfran police department has told us it's a violent death and an investigation.
The brother of Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was a former high school chef in Boston, gained his dream chef's work at the Sons & Daughers restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters spokesperson said that his death was “hounded and destroyed. ”
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much,” said the spokesperson.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows of Frank's family and friends are ours.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the hostels, but that “the last time he began to give it up, ” he said.
“He found an apartment, walked with a girl, ” said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he'd want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to join the family, he always made us food, he made us dinner,\" said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any fight.
He was a brother who took things the way they were.
“ Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the unbroken diamond that shined every day,” he said.

The Czech Railways invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
Three cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the modernisation amounts in the years with the exception of 2012 are gradually falling.
In the last six years, Czech Railways have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
Three cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent has been shown to reduce average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
The larger share of investment was given by the carrier to regional transport, with approximately 60 percent of the money involved, and 40 percent of the company invested in the renewal of the vehicles for remote transport.
The average age of locomotives and units currently reach 19 years.
However, modern older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles does not count, the average age of driving vehicles of ČD would increase by 10 years.
A little older are on average personal wagons whose average age is 23 years old at the start of modernisation.
If only the age of the date of production was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
Classic sets consisting of wagons and drawn locomotives, however, in recent years from Czech and global railways gradually pass out and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015 there were Locomotives from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the mid of this year also decreased.
The carrier was removed in particular by old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, he had the carrier scraping 110 of these vehicles.
For example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speed up to 200 kilometres in the hour planned by the carrier on the Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic speed line, can be indicated from the investment in the vehicle park.
The contract consists of a collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
For a quarter of a year, the authorities know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally helpless, they admit it.
For a quarter of a year, online editor of the daily daily.cz is watching the story of billboard in southern Bohemia, which is now attracting motorists to visit Lipna, where it is not only an interesting tourist tour in tree crowns but also an Olympic park.
Keepers know it's up there, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds of ads all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there's a house-to-house law that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards right away.
They're gonna need a complicated bureaucratic bike first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or just a few meters of advertising, and the official process has to start again.
Road headquarters and highways a quarter ago admitted: at the main route from České Budějovice in Lipno, it stands on our property near the State road advertising billboard black.
Not even three months, but the officials were not enough to get rid of an unauthorized transmission structure with a giant inzer poster.
It's like no one would mind standing right next to the truck, in a 50-meter safety zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers claim that billboards can't simply deal with the whore law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
“We must not afford that,” says the spokesperson The Director of the road and the motorway Nina Ledvinová, referring to a complicated bureaucratic bike that must be removed from billboard under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate started on-line daily Current.cz in detail watching in spring, is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot stand and the authorities effectively and quickly solve.
Only in southern Bohemia, the editors have counted dozens of similar mobile advertising placed against the rules just next to or near the car.
There are other countries in the same way.
“We are in trouble to force the pilgrims to remove,” confirms the head of the Department of Transport of the Czechoslovak Regional Office Jiří Klása, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klaus, there's a terrible law in the wine that binds officials.
First of all, the owner of the billboard must call to put the advertisement away.
However, the bosses are often inadvertent or know the finals that they already have.cz in the past described when the issue started to be more detailed: just a mobile stand with a commercial shift by a few meters and officials can throw the previous challenge to remove black advertising into the basket.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where illegal billboard stands.
“If someone does not agree with it and coordinates, they look at it as new equipment and we must address the owner again,” explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could have brought a new law, which, since September next year, prohibits billboards at the highways and limits them to I. class roads.
The criticism points out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as they have so far been.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
So companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns per year on the leases of illegal areas and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard on Lipno belongs to the Commerz Billboard company.
Officials know her well: the Czechoslovak Magistrate is currently leading three administrative procedures for blackly built billboards.
The company is at risk in each procedure of three hundred thousand thousand fines.
These are more advertising, which were placed in the class I safety zone without authorisation.
Driving is not finished yet, says Jaroslav Máz, head of the Department of Transport of the Czechobějovické magistrate.
Advertising, which is not currently interested in.cz, although it does not yet set up among these cases, will soon be brought to them.
According to RSD Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case would therefore be on the regional table and then probably Magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that cannot be contacted.
It does not take mail and the official seat on Žižkov has been cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even obvious who's behind it.
In the past, the company’s mail went to Anton Fischer’s Jihočian businessman, who sent a sharp argument with the head of Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose area of Euro Billboard is renting from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, but in the past he refused any connection.
At this year's spring, when the RSD started on the initiative Update.cz interested in advertising in Lipno, Fischer had officials sent a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his guest house, where allegedly the newly located company.
However, neither of this address has ever been heard from the highway managers until this day.
A dream fight.
Similar silences or transparent changes in the seat are not unusual.
Several years ago, we gradually gave fines for two million crowns.
But she changed her name and IČO and there was nothing to deal with.
Executor of the case backs up, commercials standing still, maybe in other places.
We are quite helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, it admits, on condition that anonymity is maintained by one of the officials.
There is no one to discuss the amendment of the law in this regard yet.
At present.cz spoke with several Members who were involved in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the term for the conservation of billboards with major Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also for regional and municipal policies a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic theme.
On the one hand, they know about social demand after their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need it for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stand up with the relatively established impression that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change laws.
Farmers will clean up less grains this year, but more rapes and maces are estimated by statistics.
According to estimates from the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals will be 6,7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this harvest has exceeded its average over the past five and ten years.
On the other hand, the rape harvest (by 3.9 percent) and the mac (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest will be 6,7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will clean up 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office by the Czech Statistical Office, according to the state of July 15.
The initial estimate before the month was more pessimistic and assumed a decimal decline against last year.
However, last year's cereal harvest was excessive.
This year's crops exceed the average for the past five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year, the harvest of the rape and mace will be higher.
Farmers will calm down by 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1,256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's mother's harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in the production of cereals is due to both the reduction in the hectares yield by 3.7 percent to 5,71 tonnes per hectare and the decline in the area of the seed.
The farmers this year had three percent less fields.
The wheat is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic this year, according to an estimate of 3,3 percent less.
Farmers at the same time put it on more fields.
However, lower hectares yield is signed to fall to 6,04 tonnes.
The sum of the five-year decline in statistics is assumed in spring barley, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
In order to reduce crops, a reduction of 15.2 percent is expected, but also a lower hectares yield.
On the contrary, the osmium barley is born by 6.3 percent more.
It will also increase the harvest of the rye.
The birth of the fissures is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
The area of Oscillation has spread by 7.3 percent.
But it's going to be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's crop of rape exceeds the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while it is converted into a area more than a third of ten years ago.
In the last four years, there's also a soup with the mace.
This year the farmers sucked it out on 35.543 hectares.
The year 2008, when mac was grown in the Czech Republic on a record of 70 000 hectares, it is half the area.
Thanks to the expansion of the open areas, this year's harvest will be richer.
Stable against last year by 2.5 percent at 27 423 tonnes.
Hectar yield, but it's going to be 6.1 percent lower.
Olympic cops charged two men with a knife and a machete attack, sent them into custody.
The police charged two attackers who attacked in central Olomouc on Tuesday with a knife and a number of five-year-old men.
Even though the assaulter was trying to escape, he was caused by a fine and cut wound that sought treatment in the hospital and other treatments,” said Marie Štrbaková, a police spokesperson.
Both clear perpetrators were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The defendant filed a motion for the court to take them into custody, and the court agreed on Friday.
Both men are at risk of three to ten years of prison.
The police accused two of assaulting a five-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attacks caused him a clean and cut wound, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack preceded an incident between two groups of people who became on Tuesday at the right noon at Freedom class, reported to the police.
The Pachatels ended up in custody, informed the Olympic police spokesperson Marie Štrbaková.
A wide loop between the two families took place in the garden area outside the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the Olomouc centre.
After aggressive words they attacked two attackers using knives and machetes of a five - year - old man.
Although an assaulted man was trying to escape, he was caused by a fine and cut wound that sought treatment at the hospital and another treatment, she reported to the police spokesperson.
On a fight that raised great attention in the city centre, and because of which several police guards and guards had to intervene at the scene, they were family disputes.
Criminals of the forty - year - old man from Slovakia and the seven - year - old man from Olomouc accused of trying to hurt health and extremity.
The defendant filed a motion for court to take them into custody, and the court complied with him on Friday, filled the spokesperson.
Machetu was used in the centre of Olomouc during the mass battle by the attackers five years ago, it was only tens of meters further, before the disco Varna in Riegrovo Street.
Then the police said that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the guests of the company who stood before the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking aliens with a conditioned punishment.
An abandoned and empty house in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you're walking around them every day.
One of the most crying examples of an unused and empty house is an extensive building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Sinovast Square.
She should have worked like a hotel a long time ago.
Nothing at all.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václavské náměstí is several active houses, which despite its location, size and often even monumental protection only empty and eat emptiness.
We have selected the property in the centre using the design of Plazdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, insensitive relations between companies or are a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
Empty houses are more than homeless in the Czech Republic.
Whatever the owners pay for a special tax, they want an initiative.

My husband Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were spent on Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The U.S. Democrats candidate at Hillary Clinton's presidential office published her tax statements on Friday, increasing the pressure on his Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year, reported to the AP.
Most of Clinton's income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mainly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that the spouses of Clinton paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year and then a income tax at state and local level of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43,2 percent of income on taxes.
However, Trump has a similar problem with a similar step, so far he has not opted for the publication of the tax award.
There's a certain possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, she wrote Clinton on the twitter a few minutes after he published her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to secrecy around Trump's incomes, including in order to raise doubts about whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims to be an AP agency.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would harm the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Caine, who, in tandem with the former First Lady, ran for Vice President's post today, published a report on his tax contributions in the last ten years.
Together with Anne Holton's wife, they gave 7.5 percent of their charity earnings and spent 25.6% on taxes last year.
In Nigeria, the defense broke again.
The Islamists from Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccinations and the doctors killed them.
There were cases of child defenses in Nigeria again.
In the north-east of the country, the government reported extraordinary vaccinations, since there were two children infected with this disease.
The vaccine was delivered by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram were working to defend vaccinations and even kill doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was unnoticed there.
In the north-east of Nigeria, the extraordinary vaccination of children against the defense begins, because there were two children infected with this disease.
In Africa, the last defense was diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that there will be millions of children in Borno state and four million more in the surrounding countries.
Nigeria military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP Agency, quickly delivered vaccines against children's defenses to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the virus in the area for many years was unnoticed.
Extremists from Boko Haram have in the past prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made Thursday impossible for doctors to get to areas where children were detected with defence.
Both the affected bagolata came with the refugees from the Nigeria part of the newly released Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for the elimination of the defense Michel Zaffran station of the BBC said that vaccination in Nigeria will start next week.
In the state of Born, the Islamic Radical Group Boko Haram worked for a long time.
The area was made available to international organisations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country significantly.
The Nigerian Minister of Health Isaac Adevole admitted that the new cases of defense are a great disappointment to the country because Nigeria wanted to report next year that the defense was being made out in it.
WHO pointed out that it is possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it has spread between children.
They will now be vaccinated by children under five years of age.
In 2012, half of all cases of defense in the world appeared in Nigeria.
While in 1988 it was still in 125 countries, it now remains only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and North Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He was listening to the stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from the shepherd gang.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and asked them to look in the future with confidence.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking by this meeting and call for a stronger fight against him.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome that the police freed from the power of a gang of shepherds.
The head of the Catholic Church has been listening to the stories of fallen women for more than an hour and then called upon them to look in the future with confidence, told the spokesperson of the Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited, there were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to Vatican, during forced prostitution, were exposed to severe physical violence.
Visitor Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against him, said the Pope's spokesperson.
František often points out the fate of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, there were Syrian refugees who arrived in Vatican this year in April and June due to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the jihadists' produce.
Without the Muslims' help, it's not gonna work.
France is in the fight against radical Islamism to help Muslims themselves.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls' government intends to make substantial changes in the functioning of the Mosque as well as spiritual education.
Since December last year, we closed 20 furniture and prayers.
And others will follow, announced by the Minister of Interior.
In the country works over a hundred jihadists.
“If Muslims do not help the state in combating those who violate public freedom, France will be increasingly difficult to guarantee that freedom,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only the imams who have been educated in France are preaching in the Mosques and Prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop the financing of the Mosque from abroad.
Now it comes from abroad about 20 percent of the money to build new mosques, most of Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
That is why there are preachers who can spread radicalism in France.
“Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,” the Prime Minister added.
The key to ensuring that these objectives are met will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
This should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
In the country now operates the French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the meshers and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon hit internal differences and rivalry.
“It is a total failure,” Valls recently said.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate on a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation.
They have all succeeded in other terrorist attacks in France, which, in the name of the Islamic State, have done in betraying Islamists.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that this year's new foundation would be formed in October.
It will have two main tasks - to finance the Mosque from home resources and to monitor the immams.
For the time being, it is not clear where it will take money not only for the construction of new furniture, but also for various educational centres.
However, several proposals are considered.
One of them is a special fee or a tax on the hall food.
In practice, the sellers would pay for food halls for certification.
Some of this money would then be put in the foundation money.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, there are about 30,000 on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers in the future should operate in the future, who have undergone special educational programmes at French universities.
This should ensure that the preaching is consistent with democracy.
Let's close the radical moss.
The French Government is at the same time in the campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, recently announced the Minister of Interior.
In France, there is no place for those who hate and respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country's estimates, about 2500 moss and prayers are active.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are influenced by radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have fired about 80 names, and in several other tens they consider it.
Not everyone thinks that governments can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not the case in the Mosques, young people are radicalising on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Dear Kelemen lost in the 1st round of sprint with the star of Bauge.
The Czech Railway Biker has to fight for a course of repair.
The dear cyclingist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro after the sprint qualifier between the best 18 lost in the 1st round against French Velkán Grégory Bagegom, the advocate of silver from previous games in London.
The procedure to be followed by an eight-year-old must be taken into account in the repair rides.
27 riders were built at the start of the Royal Discipline on the track and the best Czech driver currently added his 14th best time.
A two-star with a flight start hit in 9,969 seconds.
In the main phase of the construction, he was thus waiting for him in the qualifier of the fifth Baugé, who already had a Ria bronze in the team sprint.
Kelemen, in conclusion, ran into experienced Frenchmen, but he watched the process.
Great performance was made by the defense attorney Jason Kenny.
Eight-year-old Brit took over the third fastest two hundred stories and qualifications won in the Olympic record 9,551.
According to expectations, he also dealt with the last progressive German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also prepared in a compilation with Bradley Wiggins, which took the new record on 4 km in the racing race 3:50,570 and entered the final.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which the British belonged to four years after the Olympics in London, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors are pushing: They want fresh winds in the field
The representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute on a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire council to support other field events from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers failed to solve the contract questions.
Young doctors and students of medicine in July refused a contract agreed with BMA.
58 % of its members who took part in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained “and kept quiet - to the questions that led to the refusal of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive authority of the JDC has decided to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request new formal negotiations on all issues;
In response to the government's silence today, JDC Executive Board formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA Board with a view to approving the ongoing programme of exorbitant events from the beginning of September.
Spor led a young doctor this year to publish up to six hundred, including the first general sts in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, resigned after the decision to refuse agreed terms of the contract which BMA recommended.
BMA members at meetings before the vote before 55,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote of the Minister for Health, he said that the contract would mean a burden for the media in England.
Russia and Turkey: The partnership of “non-consistent”
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey gathered on Tuesday to raise their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of the long word wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the high school hall of the palace in St Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more after this reconciliation.
It came to hand, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and hardly out of him was making it so warm, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “deep friend, Mr Putin, five times as he states one of the reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its level before the crisis, but will be better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers said that Erdogan acted like nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm has revealed the opposite.
But the persistent cold that shined out of Putin showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his initial speech: Shooting a Russian combat plane by Turkey at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was agitated at that time.
Putin was handing out the wounds around him and Ankaru accused us of hitting a knife in the back of Moscow.
It was so much worse that it came from a mature friend.
Once again, building true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The country controlled the media for months led a massive celoplost campaign against Ankař.
All of a sudden it looked like the Turks could do for everything.
More serious was the accusations from top state officials about the fact that Erdogan’s own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this strongly.
But there was an official message in St Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting occurred only because Putin had received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory as well.
For Ankar, the benefits of the publication are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost out of power last month during a failed rifle, and that's why he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly also been shaken.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - especially the abolition of charter flights, which transports several million Russian tourists each year on the coast of Turkey.
This figure decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies will take a breathful breath when it is possible to restore flights.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when it was allowed to re-import agricultural commodities from Turkey.
“The tourists there, the tomatoes back here, ” as the news reported in the Vedemost newspapers.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as what he considers to be a chabo reaction to the attempt to reverse.
In addition, long-lasting long-lasting long-term talks about the entry into the EU and Putin's entry - which wants to take advantage of the coolness and overcome Turkey's bond with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked for help from the chosen authorities after the attempt to knock.
You need to understand that for Moscow, which has deep rooted fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pump, Russia's direct palace and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one analyst described me as “non-neutral society”: how they link the forces of two countries that feel to be rejected and used by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently stood in the role of the Peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of initial talks, both the presidents at the press conference said that they did not even mention this issue.
The Turkish President deliberately decided to put an end to the question regarding the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a total disaster, when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders are talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark is to be pushed back to the role of the office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland station that the RBS mark was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
She came out of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, waste marks used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sport, from the Six Nations ragby Championship to the Winbledom champion of Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more insight into national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used in Scottish customers, but it will not launch new stores.
All references to the RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the headquarters and the encoding of the stock on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that get more to the top - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the trip to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
The BBC Scotland station said: “RBS will cease to be our investor brand and brand that our employees are working for, because we are now much more becoming a brand bank.”
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now, I'm saying that we don't have global aspirations, we have domestic efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something very different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
The RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations Championships, has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsoring brands.
“It is a good time for us to move to the bank of brands, because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better customer bank,” said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we were going to be a great customer bank and we introduced those brands.
But along with our focus on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can recall these signs, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horse Predilation led to the 3000th prize winner
Dettori's spraying champagne after his double victory in Newmarket brought him 3000 wins.
Hot Frankie Dettori secured 3,000 on Friday. Britain's victory in Newmarket.
This milestone reached its second win at night on his local track - on the horse Predilation, which John Gosden is training.
Five-four-year-old Italian is a sixth-year-old jockey who achieved this result in plane racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion of Dettori, who had won the horse Ghayar, said: “It’s strange.
I'm very touched because there's also my family
I'm so glad it happened in Newmarket because I just got stuck here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations after winning Predilation
The two jockeys of this milestone reached the obstacles to Richard Johnson's champion and the 20-time Sir Anthony McCoy pension champion, which led to more than 4 300 winners during his career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, 4 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best yokeys of modern time, and it is no surprise that he reached a milestone that only a few riders achieved before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fištrón, which distinguishes him from other riders in the weight.
He's a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only traveled on weekends and big races, he would have already had 6,000 winners!
But the truth is Frankie was driving a winner in the UK to a greater part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living character, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump.
From the summer finals to the summer jump - Frankie Dettori was a messenger of British plane racing two decades.
It was like riding a mountain track.
The vast number of great races, including his known “great sevens, ” in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and had a ban on drug launch.
Three years ago, he first stopped when he returned after a 6-month start ban, but he showed incredible internal power and all the doubters, despite returning in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has already said that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the head of Sergej Ivanova's president's office
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the post of chief of the President's office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of the closest Putin associates for many years.
Ivanov was appointed a special representative for ecology and transport.
Kremlin’s statement states that Putin “freed Ivanov from his services the head of the Russian President’s office, but was not given a reason.
His place will take over Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Four-four-year-old Vajno was a diplomat earlier.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he promoted to the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it states that later he was the head of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
At the appointment of Putin, he said: “Thank you for your trust -
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your action by the Head of the State within the meaning of the draft laws and control to what extent your instructions are being followed.
Putin on Friday, the Russian television station said Ivanov asked him to be released from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Precious smiles?
This step was completely industrialized by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had been working for KGB as well as Putin.
As chief of the President's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, who sent out state television, both men said that he was leaving the President's office on his own request.
But the smiles convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some struggle for power?
Nobody knows that so far.
But the official claim that a man once considered to be a possible president wanted suddenly to conduct an environmental policy of Russia has met with great distrust.
On the Kreml site, notes are quoted to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012, I asked you in an interview to give me this very demanding post, even to say a problematic post, he would have agreed for four years.
As it seems, I was head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took place in December 2011.
Before that, he became Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, worked for the National Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin Velel Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
In fact, it was also speculation that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin in the country after his second election period, because the third period would be anti-proliferation for Putin.
This post, however, took over another close to Putin’s coworker Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidential office at just three and a half months later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the Myšlenko Crimes show, was released after he hit the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS television stations produced by the series in the joint declaration of its release have announced.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his notice of fire.
There were creative differences on the scene and I did not agree.
I'm sorry it happened,\" he said in his statement.
According to the ABC and CBS statement, details of how Gibson's character will disappear from a series that follows the stories of the FBI agent team, a little later.
The four-year-old actor, whom she celebrated the main role in Dharma and Greg, has been performing since the first series in 2005.
“I love Myslenka a criminal and in the last twelve years I put my heart and soul into them, ” said Gibson in his statement on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it till the end, but now that's not gonna be possible.
I would like to express my thanks to authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, to the great fans in which this show could ever hope for.
The return of the show to the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be a sandy eel that left out the water.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his finding in the assumption that someone could help him explain how about 5centime fish in his garden got to him.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connecting to Fife
Project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge is now connecting with Fife.
This is the first of the four closures between the “wars of the platform” that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
The economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first who came from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment for building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project we have all seen how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge in an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and mass of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the floating bridge of delicate operations required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place is now quite more than 79 % of the total surface area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now taking off in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Convertors project, said: “The first cap at the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
This amazing project represents the top of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the widening North Tower platform then we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the north approach viaduct of 700 millimetres south direction.
This was a massive and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Massive because viaduct is a length of 222 meters, weighing about 6 000 tonnes and it was necessary to pull up about 3%.
The delicate fact that the tolerance that the team worked with was very small - only a few millimetres each way.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Molfre Bay: Three men are “happi that they are alive. ”
Three men are “lucky that they are alive, ” after the water was flushed out of their fishing ship at Angesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boats reported the alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw an incident in the Moelfr bay.
All three men tried to sail to safety, while their boat continued to move on.
“We saw how their boat circled near them, and we thought the worst,” said Moelfre Vince Jones.
“ The strong wind cast him away from them before we left, ” he added.
Two men saved the local fishing vessel, the third man aged 60 was found without a lifeless vest exhausted, holding the fights.
They were all transferred aboard a coastal lifeboat and transferred back to the rescue boats station.
Jones said: “Your men are happy to be alive and totally unharmed.
The engine had a cable for an emergency shutdown, but somehow there was a separation from the person who was driving the boat when there was a flip-off.
Someone's holding a protective hand against those boys.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of the silencer's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three MPs who, according to the prosecution, should receive from Prime Minister Nečas and his then chiefs of the Jana Naga's political strike, i.e. a lurking post for political retreats.
In 2012, it was about the approval of the tax package.
Snatd, Fux and Tluchor made it possible for his resignations.
Then they showed up on the state-owned posts.
Therefore, they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they did not properly, and they had a total compensation of almost 2 million crowns.
The silencer is now acting as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
Yet, she wants to be a judge, Helena King, careful (serious criminal matters - know. red.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be taken into account by another Prague court district.
The king has already twice removed Jan Nečas' fault, before Nagay.
It was about alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
He didn't set up the Tluchor in this case.
According to a lawyer, Jaroslav Ortman is concerned about a misinterpreted reaction.
I don't think impartiality can be interpreted in such a way as to rule out the court if the Witnesses have a wife or relative to the court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge at all for the journal.
- It seems to me to be intimidating, - he added.
Roman Boček, former official, is charged in the political case.
According to his attorney, Peter Toman, but any objection would have a chance to succeed.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed the prosecution of the Prime Minister Peter Nečas Jany Naga (now Sunday) on June 13, and other accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
On the photo comes Nečasová with her husband to court.
The crowd was supposed to deal with the statements on Peroutk.
For example, the wife of the ambassador was to judge President Miloš Zeman's statements of a democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman said he had a connection with Adolf Hitler.
One of the school kids is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an allied air raid.
She flew to Syria with her two same old girlfriends last February from Gatwick Airport.
The British Ministry of Interior did not comment on her death.
The young Londons that escaped from home were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abasa and Kadiza Sultana were headed by the media for their next former classmate from Bethnal Green Academy in London.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security records estimate that some 600 British Muslims have yet to go to Syria, about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the IS radicals and other groups.
Those who come home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred thousand dollars.
Great paid work you don't even need college for.
So it looks like an eggman's first sight.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on the Czech ratios of extremely high pay (in Prague you will earn up to CZK 180 000), but also the extreme benefits.
The reason for this is a huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most interesting is according to the staff statistics of Grafton programmers, developers, networking engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, he does not agree with candidates for a job, but a job position on candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College isn't necessary.
At the same time, higher education is not necessary for the Asians.
Higher education means a good basis and is the overall indicator of intelligence and degradability of the candidate, but has often not much in common with knowledge of development.
The developers have to learn new things constantly, which will not replace the university once, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He's been made in Prague most of the time.
The wages of the Asians are everywhere moving high above the Republic average.
Most of the money will come to Prague and Brno, it is no longer such a Nazi in regions.
The conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague, - confirms Cuba.
Technical directors are getting the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno, they can come to CZK 120 000 - 180,000.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but there will be no more than CZK 80 000.
The demand is also IT project managers.
On arrival, they can make 60 000 - CZK 100,000.
The fight is also about graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the office of employment, they don't pay for it.
If companies change and redistribute themselves from another company, they like to claim to graduate.
They can raise it in their own way.
Without a tongue, they won't work.
The knowledge of a foreign language fits in every profession, but at least a decent English is required.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is the necessity of some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a highly educated and experienced person and only satisfied with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he adds the Director of Cuba.
Gooó in Googl, there's paradise.
Just quietly, Czech workers can see the Googl workers.
Of course, there is a flexible working time for them, a possibility of working from home or a wide range of short-term jobs, not just for moms.
The company offers four weeks of additional leave after the birth of the child,\" says Martin Jonek, spokesperson Google.
Health care for employees and family, catering, transport, training, wellness or massage is also offered directly in the workplace.
If you want to learn, it has green hair, and it doesn't matter what the new one wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator free of charge is certainly not to throw away.
Healthy lunch (in some locations and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kins in all offices, where people always find a healthy luncheon, and there's a spokesperson.
And so nothing's going to have to go away, so what doesn't eat goes into a box that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these on the Czech scales of incredible advantages?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it is not important that employees sit in office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,” adds the speaker.
The UN criticized Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday that he systematically violates human rights to criminalise refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government - raises serious concern about Bulgaria’s failure to comply with international law - warned Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein in its statement.
He pointed out that, in particular, it is particularly worrying to be a witness to how important and powerful public figures express public support for criminal armed struggles organised by horsemen at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey,
“One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to Bulgaria’s territory in an irregular manner are automatically arrested,” said Zeid.
And what's worse - often criminally prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised despite having every international right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has received 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the last decade have reported that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer spending free time in front of the screens.
The Pokémon will raise the people from the couch and lead them to activity.
Time spent in front of the screen was originally creamed on TV, later on on video games and not least on smart phones.
It's great to see technology and activities out there don't rule out.
Of course, I'm talking about the fashion that Pokémon Go is, the application based on characters that appeared for the first time in video games at the end of the 1990s (the later was created by a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in this new game at the start of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
It was then postponed in other countries because of the great interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go received more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as his Twitter.
How does it work?
Shortly, the players on the smart phone go out looking for Pokémony that they follow using GPS, and when they find them, they can “dispose them” (over screenshot on the phone) or“ catch them.
Mania welcomed the generation that played at the younger age of the game, picks it up from the seat and won't go out looking for Pokémons.
In the United States, this game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps that “medium - every day will be made.
The Cardiogram application for smart watches from Applu, which has been watching 35,000 users recently for Washington Post, has said that within two days of starting the game, the number of people who practiced every day for 30 minutes has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who plays Pokémon Go - sees only rough data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns that seek to “get 30 ” “get up out of the couch, ” and“ be active every day,” the majority of public health messages were boring and determined by people who do not look well.
Yet, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in mass control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot show here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go lies in the fact that people walk out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sun rays, and fun.
Some people even get new friends during the chase.
As it happens, they will, of course, find those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can walk into the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time of application for smart phones, like Fitbit, they could follow our activity, but they wouldn't give us a reason to do something like this.
The news looks out and the interest in it begins to fall at some point.
However, thanks to Pokémon success, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people chase for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles got gold in a lot of women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Balles is immune to all this.
Dynamic to jump.
No sign of a hammer.
They all spoke of the simple ones.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19th American gymnast went on a straight road on Thursday for the title in the polygraphs and others on a full line under the Olympic headlamps overrun.
The overall result of the 62,198 was clearly confirmed by her lead before a silver medalist and a member of the team “final fives - Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the performance on a hammer in the final of multiple individuals in sports gymnastice at summer Olympic Games 2016 in Brazil Riu de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American in a series that won the multi-fight, and fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation for the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best ever.
When her overall final evaluation was on the board and her long journey until this moment ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success fits it into the same leagues of unique athletes of their time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has been dominated by her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals on world champions - including 10 goldens. Her impressive compositions are a mixture of ambitions and accuracy and Olympic champion from 1984, Mary Lou Retton named her “the best gymnast she has ever seen -
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not just between the Balles and the rest of the racers, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring in Texas with the hands of full of gold medals would be perceived as disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raismanová is interested in winning the gold and silver medals in the female multi-bitch in the summer Olympic Games 2016 in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Balles won Tuesday, when she was like the extortionist at the celebration of the national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Belles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her compositions in simple - the one that contains a typical triple salto with double turnover - is set in Latin music that would just go home to the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girls adopted her grandparents as a bat and her talents discovered the mother of Coach Aime Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The competition has not been won since 2013 - this is the victory track that can continue as long as Balles wants to.
Even if Mustafin took a short lead with two turns, it was just an illusion.
Forename and simple - where Balles defends the world championship - they wait.
She got back to her forehead with 15,433 points behind the hammer - and closed with 15,933 points in simple.
Raisman was gently hugged when she was waiting for the final score - a mere formality - and around the shrewd red, white and blue shadows with the Balles appeared tears when she fulfilled the wish that once had been written into her diary.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third line with Mustafin, then the bronze was due to the sum of three best sets.
This time, a twenty-two-year-old team captain that Americans say “babča” was pretty forward.
After her simples, she sent a crowd of air kissing, a restored crowd, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the contribution that this 19th-year-old athletes put on Twitter this week, where he became an absolute hit, is a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot in a serial killer case when listening to music in the car
According to the police report published on Thursday, two women died and a girl at the age of 12 during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, they were shot when they sat in the car, talked and listened to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefan R. Ellis and daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight of the hand weapons, then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth three times murdering a robbery, because the attacker didn't take his wallet, or the $2,900 that she had one of her adult victims.
A spokesperson in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that the investigators find out if the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred within four months, where seven people were killed and two others were injured.
“It is happening in the villa quarter before the houses,” Howard said earlier this month for the branch of the CBS CBS CHO station.
The police believe that the suspect used several cars, including brown nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that attacks were linked and executed by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital, where she later managed her injury.
Liner (31) and daughter of Ellis Maleah died on the spot.
The police witness said it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, whose target became an empty delivery half an hour before a triple homicide, and the police think that its originator was this serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and the remains of the balls in the seat and built a bullet from under the engine hood.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephalials: “His condition is improving. ”
Edmund Piccito, like most of his children's age, loves singing, toys and, of course, also his mother.
But unlike her peers, they have microcephalials, which are due to genetic disorders that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and maybe she won't even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the Institute.
“My first reaction was that I thought that people no longer do this today, ” explains Picciut.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit down or crawl, and he still doesn't talk.
Some gaps are already slowly filling.
He's going to help and ride a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth shows a sign language, using which Edmund says: “Please, sing to me.
“We teach him sign language”, said Picciut for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign - he says that Edmund made up some characters himself.
Microcefals may arise from a number of different states: genetics such as Edmund, and after infections in the pregnancy caused by viruses such as exhaust or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary substantially.
It is too soon to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of infected.
Picciut reminds us of the emotional tax she chooses the uncertain future.
I keep asking: “What will continue to happen, ” he says.
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don't expect anyone to ever tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is getting better.
Know it'll be better.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods requested rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and vast floods in Louisiana have caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
National meteorological services (NWS) have reported that after extreme lilyings, a number of rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi will spill out of their banks and threaten large floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are continuously in contact with local authorities and the aid is already on the way to affected areas.
Mike Steele, Governor's spokesperson for national security and preparedness in crisis situations said they're getting requests for a vehicle for driving in water, boats and sand bags.
Steele said he only asked Tangipah about ten thousand bags of sand.
The flood patrols remain in most southern Louisiana to work for Saturday.
Meteorological service in the declaration said that the sea can be accompanied by more about 8 to 13 centrifuges.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on an emergency on Friday when the rains continued in the area of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are supposed to be iconic about the weekend.
The Methodologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further pointed out that the dangers are floods in the Ascension district, when these distributed flows will only flow slowly to the Maurepas lake.
The Tickfaw River, a bit south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level of time on Friday at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking up the people from the water in Amite County and Wilkinson in the Southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his stepfather were before Friday among the survivors at Gloster.
Hansford (62) said that the water from the Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, grew fast overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepfather who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water approached, ” said Hansford.
We had it all the way to the passport.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that the crisis workers saved all three giant trucks in military style and transferred them to the Gloster fire station, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that the floods “fishing rapidly, and the authorities are considering evacuating with the continuation of precious rains.
According to Krautmann's observer near Livinston, he announced that from midnight to Friday morning he fell 35 centimeters of rain precipitation.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily saturated since Wednesday.
The authorities said that the fine rain and the paid journeys requested the rescue of the inhabitants from their homes in the Tangipah district and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
WWL station CBS reported that 200 homes were flooded according to the old man from Tangipah.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both but now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals, which were trapped by high water.
In Amite, and in Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
“They will be able to return home when the water starts to rain, ” he said.
More than 20 streets were closed due to the floods in Tangipah district in Hammond, and locals had a bag with sand that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
“The last great floods we had here in March,” said the city manager Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager of the crisis situation in Harrison County, Mississippi, said that the rain continues on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said that Thursday was announced to sink a few houses, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shooter Value Foods, Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“ I saw water in several places where I had never seen it before,” said Townson, “and it is still there.
Mahaj Brown (6) - “The guy shot as it was done - survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia.
Her child's grandparents identified her as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious of transporting to the hospital.
“He caught a lot, his little body was shot as addressed,” said his grandmother’s station, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy's in critical condition at the hospital and he's undergoing several surgeries.
A family for the station said that the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to get into the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is critical, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two other victims in a stabilized state.
According to the report, the child was found shot on the front seat of the vehicle along with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men might be a shooter.
The investigators at the CBS Philadelphia said that there was probably a firefight between several armed men.
There were shells from an attack weapon of different types belonging to different attack weapons found at the scene.
Apparently, it was definitely about the ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
It appears, therefore, that there were several armed combatants that were actively involved,” said Anthony Ginaldi's police station captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and vehicles in the area have also been planted.
No one's been arrested and the police are supposed to examine video footage from the camera.
Another six-year-old kid, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray shot on Tuesday before the house in West Oak Lane's neighborhood.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine a female gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games, which is for a few reasons.
First, I've been to every summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Balles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kociano.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also established the presence of black and Latin American on the tip of this sport.
A gymnast number one in the past four years was African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second track last year.
That means something.
Gabby Dougals was surprisingly the champion of the Olympic Games and America was jasala.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of the three-fold world champions of Simon Balles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have demonstrated unexpected, but the master gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who gained gold in a female multiple.
And a member of Aly Raisman's team got silver.
We're seeing a sports peak, but in gymnastics class, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie attended the Olympic team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They are a “final five” because the gymnast team for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year Martha Karolyi is training.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who are paying the costs of training, equipment, travel, dressings, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their trustees and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnast all trainings and for families gymnastics and gymnasts are a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Balles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they began gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring training gymnastics, which are more accessible and accessible communities to countless young girls, whom Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15 000 young people within the city (predominant black and Spanish origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastik to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastik, and that is great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for having proved “girl power” and you won the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to go on the road to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After refusing Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are prepared to enter other stables
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be an end to the failure to change, but 58 percent of the 37 000 young doctors who took part, the agreement refused.
Hunt discovered in July plans to enforce a contract with the fact that NHS was in “no one, and the next delay would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourtová, President of the BMA Committee on Young Doctors' Declaration last night, said: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and therefore fair treatment with all doctors.
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes into a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have been met with irresistibleness to involve Dr. and often with a deepening silence from the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise from last month, this possibility is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, press on enforcement and address the concerns of young doctors -
If this does not happen, young doctors are prepared to take further steps.
During the last stop at the end of April there were almost 13,000 routine operations and 100 000 visits, since sisters and specialists were called to enter doctors who were among protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be a conclusion of the non-conformity.
BMA wants higher wages for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, president of NHS employers, called on a young doctor not to enter any stables.
Mortimer said: “There will be little or nothing in the field of action, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services, and they will raise fears, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caring staff and their families.
In the past two months we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and others we have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervision and informer.
Employees hoped that the continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as extortion, flexibility in training, other training for those returning after the interruption of careers, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and pay gap between genders - was evidence of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements with BMA achieved in November, February and May.
Treatment for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around 60 crowns (two libra).
Ticagrelor’s blood-abdominal medication reduces the risk of seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS vatchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, NHS vatchdog NICE recommends that humans be given for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people will suffer from heart attack or heart stroke every year and a quarter of them will be affected.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat that creates a consistent layer on the walls of the artery.
If this layer is severed, blood clots may occur, blocking blood access to the heart and heart attack.
If the clot relaxes, the bloodstream may continue to block the blood supply into the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have had a heart attack have been exposed to a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which produces the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the business name Brilique, reduces the risk by creating clots less likely.
In the draft NICE directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack or stroke affecting another heart attack - often with devastational consequences -
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient's life.
Ticagrelor has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack.
We are pleased that, in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment over this period is not recommended.
With computer culture, fraud began in Muslim areas.
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, which was connected with government report
The culture of political integrity has led to overseeing the widespread frauds in Muslim communities today in the government report.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles criticizes police, electoral inspectors and city halls for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “the sensitivity of ethnicity and religion”
The former Secretary of the Community, now the government of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should do corridors and fearful voters in front of the election rooms.
He recommended that the voters take the ID card with them and prove who they are in elections.
At present, voters need to state their name and address.
In the report, it is also proposed to give the person’s fingers when giving up the voice to carry an indelible ink in order to avoid choosing twice.
Whistleblers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
He asks that the press be given greater access to the documents from the meeting and to decisions adopting informal committees or working parties.
“It is not only the protection against election fraud, but also the protection of local governments from a wider corruption environment and financial fraud that go hand-to-hand with it,” he said.
Report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after the corruption and illegal practice charges.
The court found that Rahman “canically intervened, religious worship of his Muslim community, and silenced his criticisms by accusations of racism and Islam.
Rahman, according to his words, “has led his campaign so that the religious responsibilities of Muslims are given to vote for him. ”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of theft of an identity, when a person votes and sets out to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about fraud in the correspondence vote - which claims that the older members of the Muslim community developed pressure on people during him to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations how to clear the electoral system, including the submission of an identity document
In his report, he stated: “The evidence that women and young people are vulnerable, especially women and young people, the pressure has been developed to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in the communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh,
“The concerns that... state institutions have welcomed eyes against such behavior because of “politically correct, hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion”
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean the system, including to prevent political activists from being manipulated with correspondence votes and thus to prevent ‘ voting burdens’.
The report currently evaluates Theresa May also asks for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of election lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit an identity document before voting.
Using an impervious ink to the fingers of people when voting to avoid having to vote twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence shall be limited to three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating their responsible correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
To give the police permission to create a cordona around the electoral rooms.
Change the laws to make it easier for people developing an illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Show photos in electoral rooms.
Require that only the English (except Wales) work in the electoral rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters walk into the constituency booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says that he is “precious,” that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges have been raised.
“The election session ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litania of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For many reasons, he was found guilty of reasonable doubt - in strength to prove the crime.
It also criticizes the ‘checking cheeks’ as a result of the registration of voters at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “The New Court Decision in the Tower Hamlets case by waking up.
Our nation has a proud legacy of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral frauds and the state of rejection by some institutions threaten this reputation.
Disturbing cyclical twin Duchess Kate and other pair of famous figures on the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went nuts this week into French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Pevot, which is only an impressively similar duke from Cambridge.
But a four-year-old Olympic is not far from the only asset seeking gold this year, which can boast of its own double from a number of famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous figures that appear at present on our paintings, the FEMIL column has compiled a list of Olympics that are more than far similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As hunted game: Member of the American team of archers Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonard DiCapri
In addition to Kate's twinning on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonard DiCapria.
The racer from the team of American archers Brady Ellis caused a storm on Twitter after they drew up his images on which the Wall Street wolf strongly resembles.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Lem since he was little.
“ There is no great similarity for himself, perhaps except for the beard,” said Brady for the Huffington Post.
\"He's a loser and he looks good, so I think he's a compliment--
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will be highlighted this year even more: an impressive look between the British jumper to Greg Rutherford distance and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
About the Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin with her big, distinctive eyes, it was said that she was a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has been compared to the star of Gel Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The User thinks that Nathan “attletic version” is an actor from the movie Start (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nader and actor Josh Hartnett, who have such dense clouds and lips.
The Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same hair as Annalynne McCord. And Nathan Adrian from the USA team, fans say it looks like Joseph Gordon Levitta's “attletic version. ”
Remote Women: Hope Sol football star (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
In waves theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind similar couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction over the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are in the truth identical”
Hope Sol's football star and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter really have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of Laura Linney's actress, or the owner of the gold medal for Gabby Douglas's gymnastics, proud of her beautiful wide smile, which as if he copied Gabrielle Union's smile, the movie star Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the Olympic Games station CBC apologized for the fact that the Chinese swimmer said that she “weaked out“
Theatres of the Wednesday live transfer from the Olympic Games to the CBC station bombed the performance analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald.
Canadian CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14 - year - old Chinese swimmers during the race “sucked like a smell - and“ blew up. ”
The commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was off when at the end of the staff of women at 4x200 meters of free style he began to snort his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had to bring “living ” to the CBC commentators team, among other things, said: “The little 14 - year - old one of China gave up, you fool.
Too much excitement, she got like a smell, blew up.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second quarter of the race at 1:57.79 - i.e. 1,61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rucková and allowed the Canadians to catch up with China.
The viewers in Canada began to quickly echo online and were horrified by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmat Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “He reported to the CBC that a 14 - year - old swimmer from China “he blew up? ”
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air--
Ai Yanhan from China, at the finale of the 4x200 metres of women's health plant, was described as: “This little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you stupid,
The critics of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't stick back
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMaxDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC, spoke for the live commentary of MacDonald and said: “We apologize for the commentary on the activities of the swimmer who escaped to broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened -
Finally, the CBC had apologized more than 90 times to those who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-rapporteur Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and added their apology to the answer for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's commentary
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
My sincere regret is that the words were spoken, she shouldn't have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those watching us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in live broadcasts and tried to explain his remark by saying that he did not want her to sound like a personal attack.
“I would now apologize for the comment that I said last night after the woman’s safeness,” said the CBC on the broadcast from the Olympics.
“I meant the performance of the swimmer and not the person a swimmer like that -
\"There is no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect, and I am very sorry.
Customers in Primary School getting hurt by a woman who's been in shame trying lingerie in the middle of a store.
When a woman dressed up to try out panties on the selling surface in the middle of the Primary, they were not buying sure which direction to look.
To make it worse, she tried to get her size down, she took her panties off, and she put them back in the shelf.
She continued to view and finally tried four pairs of pants at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokoestone.
Primary shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston where a woman tried panties before she returned to the regal
The mother of two Jenny Davidson children, who was at that time at the store, said that a mysterious woman, after testing her underwear, “redressed and left the store without buying anything, ” said Jenny Davidson.
She said: “The people could not believe their own eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
“ She didn’t even try to find a discreet place - just standing there, as a bad monkey -
“Everybody was staring at how she took off her panties again, and clearly she didn’t like them because she had returned them back to the shelf.
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like it, she dressed again and left.
“She seemed to be okay with who she was looking at, even though she thought of the person who needed to buy a pair of panties that she tried to try.
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else had and no one cleaned them up.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected the things she clearly tried to get them off the sale - which is also the only right thing.
“I would like to think that I would bring a new pair of panties home and find that another woman was wearing them, took them off, and that they were not washed up.
The speaker said: “The Primark knows about the incident that occurred at our store in Folkesten on Tuesday, August 9 -
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to defend against weapons attack using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could be a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the very master of the Kav Magy Federation, based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers near the distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly get over the ahead of you, whether it's coming from behind you or from behind.
If you get close to the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn back to see your attacker and “have a free shot.”
Then you'll understand the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder just before you throw it in your face with a free elbow.
Then you follow the knee to the weakness, and while the attacker lights up in pain, you break his gun out of his hand, hit it with the main in the face and you start to step back, you keep the gun on him.
If a armed man from the front is approaching you, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fireline, grab your gun and cut it out so that the devil can't shoot.
At the same time, put the strength in your weapons and strike the attacker into your chest, then fire the weapon from his closure and start retreating, and keep pointing at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget, the safest way to get out of the robbery - if you're not the master of Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright will provide the most desperate places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler has decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and ancient reflex - by oliling the most desperate and unpleasant places in Europe.
The moderator and author of the links Ian Wright (51), originating in Sufolk, licked the power of his immune system with its language with the euro banknotes, railing on Piccadilly Circus, a button of the alarm on the bathroom on the train and a Russian public phone.
Before he licked every subject, he used an aluminiumometer to show us everything he's letting into.
The experiment on the basis of which the film Lickhiker's Guide was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, but there is actually much more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright spoke with doctors and specialists throughout Europe to strengthen the bacteria of the intestine flora and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left him in his mouth worse than the smell.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the resistance of his intestines around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission his immune system tested completely safely - from public rail stations to alarm stations
He says: “I haven’t taken much care of my health since I was a kid, and I used to put everything in my mouth, from the dirt to the eating of worms and mud water. ”
In the film, the director confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public bathroom in Russia.
After a simple rudder, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public bathroom in Russia, but he refused to lick after what his aluminiumometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish producer of milk products Valio made a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Jinr Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film he said: “This is almost the most tangible thing I ever felt in the bathroom. ”
Nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not doing anything because it's disgusting.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Jinder Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
Mr Wright provided Valio Gefilus with a protein of lactic acid and vitamin C and D that help in humans strengthen the bowel bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenma, Senior Vice President of Valio for Refreshment, juice and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the arrest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We have devised a lot of crazy ideas that have ended with the idea “let us call Ian“
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of speaking only about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the health of the intestines and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have provided more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I wanted from him - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.
To lick some things was naturally easier for Ian, some of them were quite difficult again.
I'm glad that we licked some of these dirty things -
Valio carried out a survey in 2015 whereby 84 percent of respondents combined milkic acid bacteria mainly with the health of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent of the respondents indicated that at least occasionally they used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family of socially needed before evicting destroyed the municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of socially needed left a damage to its municipal house of £50 000 after they were charged with the terrorisation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were kicked out of the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long line of complaints against them.
After their forced exit from the house, officers of housing cooperatives were shocked when they found out that the property was in the crash state.
There were holes in the walls, floor coverings were torn, everywhere on the floor were garbage and the walls were iced.
The family has already moved and is thought to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of living in Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered because this property is likely to enter into a conscience as “not so much as a nice part“ Cornwall.
The family is invaluable, and their names are invaluable.
A couple had three sons who lived in the house sometimes, and the police said that the horrors that the family worked included were street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of surrounding residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, fights and gifts.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the lease contract, was awarded a penalty for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms in a house that might be demolished, they were found dusting garbage.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, floor coverings were torn out
The neighbors say they saw them on the street as they were with a pen, and they used to call the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing had moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they got an additional period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved welcomed the evictions that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said: “They did not care for anyone at all.
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning, ” he said.
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, manager for supervision in Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with police on a regular basis
Garbages and old toys were nested in a large part of the local house
He adds: “It is shameful that the tenant could not accept responsibility for her own conduct and for the conduct of her family. Displacement is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
There was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the local community who have informed us bravely.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bear the message that we will not tolerate unsustainable behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of tenants who lived in the house in different times were about 20 years.
Disturbed mattresses, which remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after removal
Workers will now have to remove a bunch of garbage that has been dumped around the house
In 2014, she made police at the house of the post office and found over 70 grams of hemp, weights, equipment, and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon got a fine when she was found guilty of possession of a class B drug that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was set on the basis of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.

The police say they're going to seek the eviction of tenants who violate the rules of their lease contracts
Angela Crowe, from Denov and Cornwall, said that the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to breach the rules.
“This is a message to all who think that they can be punished, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and unprepared behavior and will continue to cooperate with the partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were scared of a low flight of military jet aircraft over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun rays in Portuguese Aveira were scared to death
Portuguese military air force P-3C Orion flew up to incredibly low
Military air force declared that it was a training flight and insisted that there was no danger of safety.
At the moment the low-airing jet took over the filled beach, the panic freaked tourist.
On dramatic images, it is seen that the military plane reaches almost a touch from the sunmen on the sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to pick up after they were depleted by the noise of the jet engines without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationals who published the video recordings of the dramatic flight on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice as low, and at one point it seemed to break -
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was wrung, and I really thought that the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were horrified when a low plane appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese military air force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify a fishing ship off the coast and had to stand low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The flight reportedly flew by something lower than usual, due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. Letectvo nevertheless insists that the safety of humans has not been threatened.
The forest fires destroyed some of Portugal this summer and requested four victims on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military air force today stated that the pilot had to fly low because of the dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from taking a view
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing vessel in the course of training.
Half the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the funeral service providers do not comply with legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found this during checks in the second quarter.
The funeral services, according to it, are most often not informed of the remaining prices or do not issue written confirmation of taking orders.
ČOI imposed 41 fines in total worth CZK 77,000.
Today, she was informed by her spokesperson Jiří Fröhlich.
Inspectors found doubt at 47 out of 95 controls.
In addition to the non-information of prices and missing confirmation, certain funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the sold products were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unregulated measuring device.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This covered sheets, candles cover and vases which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
In view of the fact that there is still a breach of the law in this specific area of services, control actions will continue in the next quarter of this year, - added Fröhlich.
The London Schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British school kids who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
The legal representative of Tasnime Akujee said that her family found out about her death in the Syrian Cancer a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Rakka, which is a bast of the group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to escape from the war of the sued country and to return to Britain.
“The man wants to believe that the only good for the whole thing - as a message and a warning for others, is that these are real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that he will betray people from ever making decisions,” Akuchie said.
Sultan and two other schools from the eastern part of London joined the plane in February 2015 to Turkey and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
Sultany's family learned that she was married to an IS fighter in Syria in a few months, and in a few months she was raised.
Reid says if Clinton's elected, she'll leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The senate leader for Harry Reid's democratic side says he's convinced that the candidate for the presidential elections for the democrat Hillary Clinton nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominees it in March.
The senate majority of Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will elect the future president.
Reid stated during the conference call on Thursday that he believed that Clinton would choose Garland “with a certain degree of credibility.
Reid's spokesperson later said that he didn't talk directly to Clinton about whether Garland was nominated and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want someone else's choice to “go off the ship, ”
Garland is president of a federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are “deservers, ” and“ the jumpers, the Republican candidate for the Presidential Office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't going to the office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars for “woman and men are also for men. ”
Magazín Treats cooperates closely with photographer David Bellemer for the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli Calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of revealed known figures, NU Muses is trying to find another generation of top models for its 2017 NU Muses calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nakedness from Playboy from old school is different because “Playboy is for men. ”
I do it for women.
Clearly, the calendar also believes.
“We must return to depicting timeless and classic nakedness when women and men are comfortable and let themselves inspire photographs of a woman’s body,” said Shaw in a press release to issue calendars.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is the guilt: who really buys turntable plates?
Vinyl loves being alone in the middle of a century.
Before you decide to absorb the comments by means of false remarks under the pseudonym of NeVichniOsatilíMiežiVe trzedníVe trzeżdníVeżecz, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed resurrection of phonophone boards is connected not to the boom of the millennials who want to love the original reality of the physical object, but with mid-life Nostalgia.
Recently, those who bought the wine album are most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people aged 18-24 are least likely.
It's not really about the accumulation of an exciting fan - it all has an emotional dimension: older people who buy turntable boards, they probably want to keep their feelings (56 % versus 53%) and they like themselves (69 % versus 66 %).
But the results of YouGov are true?
If this blog was sent as a television report, I would be followed by a camera, as I head out to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a delicate gray suit and impressed widely. Then I would stop, pull my hands out and say something authoritative, like: “So let's look at it--
Let's take a look at this.
While his charm and charm are slowly lost from the heart of Soho - buildings once occupied by independent dealers, hotels, restaurants and dining facilities, confections and office needs are now being filled - several fantastic specialised shops with phonophone plates remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (calculation: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Rekkels Records (calculations: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London afternoon and he's looking at business to fill out several hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
\"I think so,\" he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All these recordings are floating walls of his living room - on the picture above (the picture sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles has also thanks to the fact that they can afford it: they can now buy turntable boards that they could not afford when they came out originally and again buy what he sold in youth and did not have an elevator.
“The good thing I'm buying is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12. Then I was too small and couldn’t get them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy records are probably introverts who like society to themselves, adding: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray, and he also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new tide of people affected by the media wave, people who heard of comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntable plates back.
According to my interviews, people of their collections were most deprived of themselves between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their phonophone plates and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their phonophone plates back,\" he says.
That could explain the boom of lovers of phonophone boards of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of phonophone boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out at a store like Phonica that you will find a pleasant relationship with people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly affected by the system without contact payments.
Some of the fans of phonophone boards can feel absorbed in the digital world and have decided for a well-known environment of phonophone boards, things that create memories of peaceful upbringing.
“I think filling the gap or the reality of something material may bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, so is I, and I think a lot of people too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in the head.
“We are all like their social workers, called a coworker from a bunch of phonophone boards.
ICM's research in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought the vinyl album a month earlier haven't listened to it yet.
According to the survey, it has 41% of the recorded phonophone, which never uses, while 7% of those who buy turntable plates, do not have the phonophone.
At this point of the report, he probably seemed really concerned about going through a pile of compiling boss.
The “trophies” perspective, and the recovery of interest is something that Jonny observed (42) working at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“ Someone recently came and said: “I don’t have a phonophone, but I want to buy on the Radiohead board so that we can put it on the shelf,” he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but this is happening.
It's more about a product page than music.
People who say: “I don’t have a handphone.
These are younger people, not the older, teenagers who get into this.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for turnon boards, has many more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are several 70-year-olds, tourists who take pictures, teenagers, and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as stores earlier, it is good to see various customers instead of the hot jazz.
None of them seem particularly alone, but you don't think it's important that you spend 30 seconds next to someone.
Elanora (27) is a few minutes away in Fopp and looks at various turntable plates in the discount.
She's one of those guys who's been looking at the window rather than getting hot.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so she doesn't seem to be gathering phonophone plates.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the phonophone plates have their charms.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a business that allegedly inspired a new generation of turntable plates lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I feel like I'm a very busy little girls in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls that just sneak around the Polaroid camera. Then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's turnip.
On the left is the stairwell, whose wall covers the phonophone boards Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classic music, the basis of any average collection of phonophone boards.
No one looks at them - maybe just because they're just for decoration and some of them are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It is a purely “vinyl trick”
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for others, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area where there is probably more time and money than in other areas is also the one where it is most spent on the most luxurious goods that the guilt is.
But while according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate - at least in phonophone stores, they do not take into account a large number of wine collectors and lovers who exist in real estate stores with phonophone plates and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend the Thursday morning wandering around the store with phonophone records on Berwick Street, going through the recordings and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake television moderator who hides behind the back of a no-knowing middle-aged man.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Grono shark has the longest medium life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is studying sharks, says that the recording shows female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five metres.
In France, the court refused to destroy trades in the refugee camp of Jungle
In France, the court rejected the order of the authorities in Caliis to demolish dozens of experienced shops and restaurants in the camp of Jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to cancel a total of 72 commission shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair sobering, selling tea for 50 cents or basic food for several euros.
The Prefect Office in Caliis argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they mean the danger of a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian organisations in court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food offered by the State supported associations and other groups does not provide an addition to food for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Spacious wine shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food to people in need.
The court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for preventing people from operating 72 commission shops, but said that the objections to Calais’ prefect were “a certain understanding.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than just eating people who “live in extremely desperate conditions, ”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places where the demolice threatened was the cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which runs a non-profit organization, which offers 200 dishes, English and French clocks and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying them in the camp every day.
Over 170 000 people signed the Petitions for the Protection of “Child - coffee shop.
The Guardian received a letter by which the closing of the coffee shop “was a disaster for these children, some of them are only 8 years old. ”
Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrantts on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in camp after a steep increase in arrivals over the years increased to more than 9 000 - which is so far most often throughout the period.
He thought he was dead.
Shut up, and the voleybals of themselves.
Since March, I have been able to train normally,” he reported himself at the start of summer preparations in full strength.
What was wrong with you?
I had a two-way pulmonary embryo, then there's a problem with my heart.
Because when I was at the Korean University, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble has caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my heart for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a vein in the cage, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's falling or changing the weather.
But nothing that would limit me, rather aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
Last year, I didn't know that I had an embodies, and I couldn't move there any more.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was completely different, and I was totally out of my mind for five more days.
I really thought I was dead, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to get through it, and now it's just going up.
I know I have some problems with blood that I need to watch more when I go somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to the preparation of the Silver last year, there were still problems with my heart.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I've been making up my own home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it down, physically I'm better at it than before.
What do you expect from Us?
I'm looking forward to it. The crew looks good, most of the guys I know.
I'm curious about the next two strangers coming.
Let's hope we sit human to fit this together.
Can you pick up the U.S.?
There was a noise in the window, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now it's the other one.
There's only a few players left in the U.S.
It was the last in the extralision, so there's a lot of room to improve.
If we use it, it's on us.
We'll see after the first round, who's going to be a glitch, we don't.
Is it a guarantee of the success of Coach Brom?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot, he's going to think better than the last place.
But my arrival didn't relate to him, I made a deal sooner.
There were other trainers in the game, with one I was a big friend, and it was agreed to be working here.
I won't say a name.
In the end, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he was in good clubs, he's been training a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
He's gonna push us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I love to cook, and I like to get an opportunity in not such a top team.
I've been in Příbrami for two years, but it's a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team right now, because it starts with the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already training Australian Boehm.
What's he look like?
I know him by the way, we played against each other in the group at the university.
And we had a couple of fun together, sometimes we sat there after the fights, so we already know each other, too.
We beat them at 3:1, right away at the start of the summer preparations in Ustra.
She's got a Slovak girlfriend. She's a sympathian.
American Nadazdin and Brazil Ze are still coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting with an American, looking like a good boy, Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted an American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a tracker, so whoever makes it is I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he was, found out on the Internet, how he played, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some news on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'd come to us.
How are you looking forward to the position of a single recorder?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm only going to be 40 years old and I don't have the nature of going to change it.
I'd rather be at the center of the event, I'd rather run a team than lead someone else.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I were to be the second tracker and take care of it for full time. If something's not done, it sucks.
How many times have you been one?
Half in Zebrami when it wasn't for Kust as a captain, hurt himself, then there were problems with the money, and he left.
We've been up and down since then, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I was raised, I alternated one and two.
A great year was in the Old Town, after him I had a lot of offers and chose the Zebram.
From here on out, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embodies.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
A short position remains a Phelps domain.
“To be back on step winnings and to hear an anthem is sweet as always,” Phelps laughed, and at the same time he had his eyes filled with tears.
His fiancée and mother were in the audience again, the son of Boomer slept calmly in the ears this time.
I'm having an amazing week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started to swim, and in a few hours, it's over, he said milk.
In the finale behind Phelps, there was a silver Japanese Japanese named Kosuke Hagino who won a long position.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Shan, the bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Al Oerter (distortion) and Carl Lewis (Fork) is Michael Phelps' third sportsman who controlled the same discipline in four games behind him.
Most of the race with Phelps was held at the head of another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira.
While the advocates of gold in the final quartz 50s, he put himself in a rough final, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance in Rio to expand its unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremony, he began to the final race at 100 meters of butterfly.
The legend could not have been the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the signarian double after a hundred won in Rio and a double track.
In the finale he left 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkyn, third, Russia ended Jevgeni Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place in the last year's championship of the world, in Rio he became a signarian king.
Larkana, from the thoughtful throne, was established, with the same double prepared for last year’s world championship.
At the Olympics, he only won a medal now.
Penny Oleksiaková and American Simone Manuel were divided into a square hundred.
For the 16-year-old Oleksiaková, it was the fourth medal on these games, the second for Manuel's second after the six-year-old silver.
Plastic gold won the OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration for others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport becomes love to them, and they get to where I say the captured Manuel.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a race of 100 meters in Rio in the world record and has a silver of the Kraularian doubles.
Until the sixth time, the world record of Australian Cate Campbell ended.
The first Olympic medal was won by Japanese Rie Kanet in the 1970s.
She has no precious metal or the world championship, her maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Riu gained Russia Julia Jefimov, which, due to the start of the games in spite of the doping past, is facing the disparity of viewers and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should answer these questions all the time.
I'm so tired of it, she said Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Riu has been able to get to the special panel of sport arbitration CAS just before the game starts.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or not, or if he has any other opinion, whether he can turn to an arbitration court, he added it.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have experienced a strange day.
Only less than an hour before the game they knew who they were going against.
They must've been able to handle tactical preparation.
And then, in the unconventional time, the game started on the small court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they pulled the lead on the opponents, but in the state of 19:19 they didn't manage the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and even, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
First of all, many of the ordered services meant the 10:15 prize and the merger with the Olympic tournament.
“We may have defeated Russia,” Hermann regretted.
How would you evaluate the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I broke up, we got into the game.
At the end of my last balloon, I was hit by the income I used to get used to before.
We lost that set, which was key.
In the next set we took them with an overview of the field, another defense, and we pushed them to the service.
There's been a lot of depraved submissions in the tie-break, that's where we picked up on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated Russians.
Sluková: The pity of the beginning of the first hundred, that's where it got away.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the dots.
The second set was great and the third decision was made by the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We've given them five points, and five points have been, and we've hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the small yard number 1?
Sluková: As in China in the side yard.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, complete silence, music didn't play, nothing.
That was different from the center.
We wouldn't choose that condition, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of the opponent an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was special.
We started training for the game without knowing the players, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like other teams.
But Simon (Sniff Nausch) prepared a tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of paper prepared with a tactic, so we were pretty well prepared on this page.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
I don't think so.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12.
The Russian Block of Birlov in the preschool of playoff on OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in the village in the preschool playoff at OH in Rio.
Was it awkward?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since ten, we had the regime moved earlier.
This was two more hours away.
It's strange, I can't imagine another sport has athletes who have to do their best in 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it wasn't very typical, and I guess it wouldn't be my favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process was our target from the group, it's on one side in order, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I'm going to sleep out of it, and from tomorrow I'm going to remember the Olympic tournament only positive.
Big brother's here, coming in the first smokin' SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without the Thai passport, who will decide to arrange SIM for one of the local operators when they stay in Thailand.
For example, not only on tourists, but also on people with long-term visas, who work in Thailand, for example, or make marriages there.
The Secretary-General for National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission Takern Tantasith informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan intended exclusively for foreigners presented the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures to enable the monitoring of their location shall be put in place by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security that will enable foreign aliens to deal with criminal activity.
Moreover, so-called tourist SIM are to help reveal those who exceed the permitted length of stay.
A special SIM for foreigners should be found in the sellers up to six months following the SIM exclusively intended for the Thais.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently switched on in the case of cards designated by persons without the Thai passport.
It won't be possible to shut it down.
“This function in SIM for Thailand is not, because you can always easily watch,” added Tantasith.
Not to mention that in Thailand there are no prepayments anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, one of the operators gave a free starter SIM to tourists at the airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Even ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia or Singapore, consider the implementation of the same measure as Thailand.
They are currently subject to the mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures in question do not mean, for foreigners, the obligation to acquire when entering the SIM country of the local operator.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country after crossing the border, i.e. when the SIM is registered to their network, only the relevant network information is known.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to local operators' rates is so disproportionate that the majority of tourists in the course of their stay in Thailand will start to look after local SIM.
The efforts of the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners from the foreigners living in Thailand have been made legally by immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and in connection with the protection of privacy, the established system compares with the obligation to provide residence addresses in immigration documents.
In addition, police will need a court order if necessary to monitor a particular person.
For any abuse of the system will threaten an unidentified punishment.
“If the service provider is to monitor the position of SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence,” Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number until the expiry of the 90-day period, after which the SIM did not report to the network, it could be possible to restore the numbers after fifteen days in the event of leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in newly built on Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose to live in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the property care is provided by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking places and elevators in the house, which essentially disqualified the older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with burning floors, high energy intensity and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which old construction is unable to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the Modern Apartment magazine.
The entire interior has been designed by architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamilou Poláková from Artiga's studio.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with everyone's expert?
Our architects and architects would recommend everyone if they propose an apartment from the beginning, namely, this is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and on the basis of the customer's wishes, are able to align the interior appropriately.
We have already worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and given that everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wished a generous social and residential space with an appropriate ground for a four-member family captured as modern, but not a cold interior.
Priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, it was necessary to carbonize the quality of implementation.
Did you leave everything on your experts, or did you interfere yourself in the final interior?
We have approved all the proposals, including technical drawings and materials samples, but the proposal has always come from architects.
In the beginning we established what we expect from design and showed some of the interior elements we would like to include in the design, for example carpets or images.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors involving the works of Karl Malich, Karl Špála, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund helped us to focus on our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and nuts wood was an idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc. That whether everything was together together, then we checked together with visualization.
Were there any complications that you had to give up on your original ideas or, on the contrary, come up with a new one?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project when we came to the construction at the moment when it was possible to climb into the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we had planned were actually shaded by the surrounding buildings.
That's when we literally changed the page overnight.
The gula was used on the kitchen line as well as on the lining of the fireplace wall.
In the interior there are wooden surfaces filled with skins, such as the gimming of dishes and bar chairs of Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make some changes or is there something you wish for today?
I think it's a modern air interior that's primarily fulfilling its purpose.
We do not have the changes, most adjustments after moving in have taken place in the plane of shadowing and terrasis.
Perhaps the only leak is to the floor when the nuts are shown to us as too delicate to the house with the dog.
The word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornyová, author of implementation.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new construction, which is why it was possible to make a complete new distribution solution and several other adjustments.
For interiors it is an important element of the location of lights into the hall ceiling and the main toilets.
That's what we got the day light into the darker space of the apartment.
Also a direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction arrangements which was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to French, you're not negative, they say Muslims living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born south of France, just south of the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalisticism, which led me to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
It seemed to me that every Frenchman was so negative.
People in France are negatively loaded in general, but it has been getting worse lately.
That's interesting that you mention negativism.
This is what some people are valued by Czech nature.
Trust me, compared to the French, you're not negative.
Some people may not be like that when they come to France because it doesn't feel that much like tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big topic is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is 15 euros, which I think is enough.
There's also a problem with the behavior of people against Muslims.
That's completely incapacitable for me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I ran into a free space with Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know Prague at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't even know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine staying here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't get any negative reactions or gifts, but I feel that people are more free.
That I can do anything, dress whatever, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone's still looking at you uncomfortable, like when you have special clothes and everything.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
The ancients don't care about that kind of thing I think.
Where do you work now?
After my job in Air France, I worked for one travel site for a while.
Then we set up a website that people offer and seek shared housing with a friend.
We are now only in Prague, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are Czechs half, and two more friends from Czechs.
I have to say that the next specificity of the Czechs is that at first they hold more distance.
They won't let someone get to the body right away.
That's quite the difference between where I grew up.
Everybody's worried about the south and they're kissing on their face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak Czech.
Is your language barrier a problem?
On the contrary, I have it very simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone speaks English here.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by doing at least a little communication in English, I have no need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Did you meet with any negative reactions?
Like because you're a Muslim?
Not basically.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that's more tolerant.
One experience is attacking me.
My boss, Česka, once told me about the French football team, and she's done something in terms of: They're not French but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone might have had a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
And even though my colleague once pointed out to me about some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He told me not to go downtown to sell me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen today.
Until recently, I could not imagine something like this happening in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognise violence at all.
For me, the people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he's not God.
How do you see it when terrorists get hit by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I'm trying not to follow the violence reports much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at George's Square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims, together with the Christians, demonstrated violence.
Did you register?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Are you meeting in Prague and with other Muslims?
For example, my coworkers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I do, so we sometimes have a little bit of a wild discussion about Islam, because we all see him a little differently.
I'm from France, so I went through another education, maybe they've learned the Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People of Islam sometimes associate with the subjective position of women.
How do you feel about that?
I don't look under any circumstances.
More like the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
Even that you don't wear any head cover.
Like a hijab?
And it's signed on the most important way I've been raised.
My mother, for example, is a really basic Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear clothes.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal matter.
It depends on everyone who interprets it.
When you read the Koran, you should have your own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran, which says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said, \"I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?\"
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I add it to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the sheiks require, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
I do so far.
I haven't felt so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for me.
The Czech Muslims, together with the Christians, demonstrated violence.
Jachtárk Kozelský Fencl's wind in Rio started on a course line.
Friday rides at sea in Brazilian Riu de Janiero were released by Czech yachter Veronica Kozelské Fenclová.
In Laser Radial's class, she moved before the final two rides to the tenth place.
This would ensure that Czechs participate in the final ride.
You collect the packages as slow as it is.
They want to compete with carriers.
The TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger is behind the idea of taking the planned trip.
With the idea of inhaling the lives of three applications with different geographical range.
We started the National Drive app in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities in it, and the network will expand.
In the Czech Republic we first want to learn this before we focus more abroad, says in an interview for IGNES.cz a four-year-old manager.
How do I drive the app works, and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data on how much package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone's asking for a transfer again that day.
When the route meets the delivery time, it pairs up and the two comes with a mutual notification.
At that point, the cabin opens, where the pair arrange to pass.
How many people do you think it would have to be estimated to register that each package would always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many routes it takes to cover completely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It's already working on the main lines, and it's logically simpler than maybe on the road between the village.
The more people, the greater the potential of speed and accuracy.
People also build trust so far and find that no one will escape with the package.
You haven't had to deal with this case yet?
How many users have the service two months after the start?
Right now, we have about 5,000 people who make roads.
That's what we consider to be successful, and we believe that they'll pack up another one.
Doesn't it take a lot to keep the sender waiting for too long?
We hope that we will compete for big conglomerates only because we are able to deliver the matter even more than the same day and for a fraction of the price.
With a large delivery company, you will pay a few thousand within two hours.
You're gonna pay 100 or less here, because that's the road someone's already on.
Should traditional carriers be afraid of a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's how it's going to be.
The market has huge potential, it feeds out giant transnational carriers, as well as the business chain where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality did not correspond to what they paid for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the mailbox with a note that he's supposed to pick up his package on the branch, and first day after 7 p.m.
At that time, I've needed a package for six hours, and I've been waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't piss anyone off and send the competition signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither one has ever been involved in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began to prepare the application of the Shippansee LTD, which was used to transport packages already scheduled between the world metropolis, especially by the aircraft.
In 2015, they submitted a project for the processing of a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
The transport applications began to develop in December last year and released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippense modified for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi since this January and made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these applications from the start, which will connect in one day.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adapt to the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy is recently a topic and this is an AirB or Uber service.
Don't you worry about the effects of an area that no one can say so far about where the sharing limit is and where are the grey economies?
It's the same, it's another product.
We're clear that if it's successful and we're going up with it, we're gonna be the next one in the eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and makes money, it is not intended to bypass financial offices and tax control.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other hand, will be encouraged to tax its income if it makes it possible.
What makes you think the service has so much potential?
The sender saves and makes the transfer, respectfully reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of social networks that people divide, we would like this to be closer.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to be able to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
My people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, and we say that it's the service of people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package doesn't shower?
Each user of the application together with the registration shall scan the ID and indicate a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give you the service and the credibility of a person.
Chickens also collect stars on the basis of an assessment of the senders.
We offer insurance and details.
In case of loss or damage, the courier does not take responsibility under criminal law for the content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his trunk alone or ten kilos of fire, he's overruled by the criminal responsibility of the sender.
Doesn't it risk the abuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, supervised administrative authority, who, as the only one, will be able to see it, and we are not able to see it ourselves, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does he get after a successful delivery of the shipment into the arms of the courier?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he wants to know about.
Sendables are charged a few percent extra percent for means of contact.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent because we want to push the volume.
Also, no one can charge that the consignment did not, when he actually delivered it, receive and deliver it using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a payment of eggs and large as a bass of beer.
Then there's no more restrictions and if someone has a place in the car, he'll take over the fridge.
Plus has an opportunity to take a picture of the package in the application so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack a case if you don't want to hide the contents.
You put the motherfucker in your hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did the service start?
A friend got an idea more than two years ago, and that's when I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me the demo of an application with a transnational reach, which targets mainly on a passenger plane.
At that point, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I'd like to become it myself and put my savings into it.
The next year, it lasted before we started the whole product's creativity in London by Shippansee LTD.
But this isn't the version that you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing has been focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application because it has had birth pain and it's still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and foreign markets at the moment we do not solve so much.
We know it's a long track run, but we don't want to, we want to make a really good product for people.
Shippensee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgraded in their own way.
I'll take it from here when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application Mesík is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transferr, but the difference is that you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocation on your mobile.
The application for the couriers who want to live with it was called Mesík Profi.
So anyone can make their own money by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by taxi driver, student, mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
Now, if everyone's stupid with the glooms, they can collect this exactly the same thing.
A man sees where there are contracts, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and the package takes over.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still doing a web interface that will be difficult for companies to send shipments on the website to fill out their data or create points on the map.
We are then able to exploit them every month.
Are you now fully engaged in the project?
It makes us more difficult, but we have it normally at work so that we can benefit from the project and develop it.
We don't hide a strong multinational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of which had a brilliant idea, and the other came up with other suggestions and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us not the Czech market, but which should go with us through the ball to go to the global product and become another huge player on the market as AirBnB and Uber.
The story section of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring about almost forgotten pestrost.
This will fix the second part and solo game in it, according to the first information, will be better than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of a network flood in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which, besides running, includes the possibility of using a fighting titan.
In addition to the action band, the game will contain levels focused on the vertebral movement.
They're going to be reminded of platformers and include rebuses.
To overcome them are therefore a major purchase of double jumps, running after walls and rope slides.
In addition, enemies will also need to be destroyed.
There will be no maps that resemble the maze and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to pick up the platform and close the big door.
You're going to be the form of a fighting ground.
The speed of the game should make things easier between raging events and more peaceful moments to explore unknown planets.
We'll play for Jack Cooper's pawn dreamer about the pilot's career.
Cooper, in the beginning of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimosa, has fallen on the alien planet Typhon, which are hostile soldiers.
And there won't be a wildling out there for him.
In addition, the Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds during the crash, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with the captain's Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true before he expects.
The first step will be to steal the batteries necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls to Titan will also be significant.
Players serve as a source of information about the military past, but at the same time the robot isolated communications will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium is going to name all the injuries that Cooper's going to face when he's planned to jump.
First information on the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
Moreover, the result will be possible to evaluate in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first revenue from the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 comes on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ will live, but the original publishing remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to the THQ Nordic.
Following the release bag, THQ gained a number of its brands and the right to use logos and company name in 2013.
Nordic has released, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, another 23 games are created for publishing and 13 of them have not yet revealed the company.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning-- she clearly tried for him longer, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date me.
She's completely crazy about him.
In the first days, she even turned her voice, had such a girl, a love spell.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching it all.
He went from work on a regular basis in half a quarter, and she always left at three to buy.
She tried to at least see him every day.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I had a key, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed home in the end.
I could never go there, make the decisionful move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife had thoughtfully controlled me.
Soon I think she found out that I was in control that I would do what she wanted.
And I did.
Maybe I'm just such a baby.
Then the neighbors showed me that he knew about it too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke up, it would be bad.
The only thing she knew about her family was her daughter.
So I always put it away, come on, and keep going.
I went to his apartment once, and I needed some help in the laundry room.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous that he was seeing my wife and that he was testifying to all this.
I asked him what he'd say.
He was standing there, he was bleeding his shoulders, staring down the ground, and he didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way out of business at that time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
Nobody said anything to me back then.
I'm such a man who's never been anywhere, who's got a problem getting to know someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all this and keep her life going.
It wasn't like that.
And I didn't really deal with all this.
I've got it in me by now.
I used to give it to her a lot, but I finally left it for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more like my wife's housekeeper.
The house has always done everything - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
She always tried to keep me from complaining.
And you can say she's nice too.
But sometimes I want to babysit her, hug her, and she won't let her go.
We go out for walks and shopping, and everyone thinks we have happy marriages.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him today, he's her god.
And I don't enjoy this life.
Already when it started and I took it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I had finished it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree with it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought and finally said, “But there is plenty of space here--
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists and calling on the government and local Muslim minority.
“If Muslims do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, France will be increasingly difficult to guarantee freedom of their religion,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing the Mosque from abroad, when the money often comes the preachers of the jihad jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It has already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the meshers and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal dissipation, and that's why she never worked properly.
“It is a total failure,” Valls said.
In the head of the new Foundation, it seems to be the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as the advocate of the secular state.
In France, there are about 2500 mesats and prayers, about 120 of which are used by radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have thrown about 80 Islamic clergy out of the country and consider this step for several more decades.
This week, German police have also hit against the Jihadist spiritual police.
The Islamics reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them was running a place where the believers were allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015 there was a debate about a new institution that would replace the non-functional foundation in France.
They have all succeeded in other terrorist attacks that radical Islamists have performed in the name of the Islamic State.
The new Foundation will have two main tasks , ensuring funding of the Mosque from home resources and also overseeing the immams.
However, it is not yet clear where he gets his finances, although he considers several proposals.
One of them is a special fee for the hallal of food, i.e. for meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid to shopkeepers for food halls, which would be for granting a permit.
Part of the money would then travel to the foundation budget right now.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year, the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia goes out of France about 30,000.
In addition, in French Mosque, only preachers who went through educational programmes at those universities should operate.
This means that their preaching should be consistent with democracy.
The government also closes the radical Mosque.
“We have closed 20 of them since December, and others will follow,” said the Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve.
“In France, there is no place for those who hate and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife badly injured an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in the north of Zaragoze, writes a journal Independent.
The shooting occurred after a woman with a daughter left the garage spaces in her car.
The man was waiting in the car before the shopping center, where he also started shooting from.
According to witnesses, the man turned his gun against himself, writes the Independent.
A woman took an unharmed daughter to the hospital, and an ambulance had to come for a man in critical condition.
The act occurred around 11.00 in the central part of Aragonia autonomic area, near the local university.
With a reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes the Independent that the motive was probably unsolved by the recent distribution of both partners.
Grapes, raspberries, ginger and chilli sauce.
For years, he wishes light, well fed food, but we Czechs are rebels, and we have our tastes and our head.
And so from the summer garden smells grilled cows, baby, pork cologne.
Nothing very healthy, nothing too easy, even so sometimes with the exception of salad or monkey vegetables.
True, grilling is cost-effective for time and dishes, in addition, it's a social matter and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to make good vaginas, which are especially tablening, their preparation represents a small ritual, but there is no need to cook, to cook, to fry or to suffocate.
And that's what's gonna make us healthy.
Whether it's domestic sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and some well-encumbered grifters will be sufficient to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic bottle.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
This even looks like a time of more demanding cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be turned into water for a moment and then it only depends on the imagination of the cook as he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not like algae.
The advantage of a range of food for Asian cuisine is that raw materials are generally available.
Including the loaded sweet, sweet, sour soup, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying Sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the true pink gar of the ginger has a uniquely spicy and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it mixes from several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag suitable for size, and the annex with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance against cough or flu, is done.
The banan leaves.
In particular, they are used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and immuting food in various celebrations and rituals.
The long ribs of the banana plant are very widespread in a number of countries of Asia or South America as well as “helps, for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in them similar to that of the alobal.
The Lamb’s letter will then give food to a specific flavor.
We can buy them in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even in advance cut into the shape of the wheel.
But choose only the leaves of the green, and thus the healthy, unscrupulous, and without the stain.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salad from vakam algae, sesame and sesame oil.
That one can be bought frozen again.
Anyone who often prepares sushi will probably know, in particular, the algae of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of marine algae, of which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying of so-called leaves of nori, i.e. canvas intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame , a dark green algae growing in waters around Hokkaidó Island, is also fresh and dry and is as popular as the algae nori.
By the way, who would not know the meat of soup with vacuum, allegedly Asian women use it sincerely to recover after birth.
And at all, this algae have almost miraculous effects.
Cleans blood, strengthens blood flow, even allegedly prevents gray hair and is literally charged with mineral substances.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as spices, for example for the taste of rice.
Fresh algae are first let in the water cool, then spill, put into boiling water and half minutes of cooking.
Then they cool themselves in ice water, cut out the middle ribs and continue to be prepared, like a favorite salad.
But buying it already done, frozen, is the simplest solution.
It is therefore only to wet the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a long-lasting bomb.
If you resist and don't throw in a grilled bull.
Eating healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little chic, and you have an interesting fresh food that perfectly combines taste.
And it's done once.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radives, 100 g green chicken, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g vakame algae and 60 g sweet chili sauces.
The hair of the cut root, the spoon of the black sesame, the spoon of the srirach chilli sauce, 20 g of manga and 40 g of the castor throat, a bit of foam nuts.
First, we'll prepare the threads.
We're going to wet rice paper for five seconds in cold water.
Then we take him out and wait for him to get soft.
In the meantime, in hot water, we're going to warm the cemeteries short, about three minutes later, we're going to put them in the ice water so they don't lose the color.
Let's put the vegetable filling on the permitted paper and wrap it up.
The filling is made of white radives, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut onto fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add a chopped coriander, thoroughly mix them up and put them on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we put the cemeteries on, add the threads, and finish with all the food we'll get the algae, the ginger, the cloth of manga, the black sesame, and add some foam nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in the seven rugby, the selection of Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7th rags ended with a devastating stop at the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night Brits at the stadium Deodoro here at Riu high 43:7.
The Fieds presented a master's lesson in processing, harvesting, movement, supporting game, running on the lain and brutal force - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unmarked price of comfort in the form of silver medals - for Britain's third day - and the British could be at their performance in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven-legged rags proud, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South African Republic.
Winning over South Africans 7:5 in semifinals the same day, maybe it was frozen in the final.
However, even a 15-member team in full health would defeat Fiji in its form.
You do not write it for Brits, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will be around the neck of the gold medal: the main coach of the Fiji is Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain hurt a lot of ways.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is inviolable.
The figs began wonderfully, the passages of the British were reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other colleagues, it was like running behind a number of buses on the move and World Cup champions were leading 5:0 when Osea Colinisau appeared behind the corner.
The timer was showing four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversation was.
12:0 and Britain is hard to touch the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the great Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scoreing for the third time, but only the Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw the touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after returning, and for hours it was still more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated through the little British, and fell on the lajone where he scored.
After the conversation on condition 29:0 followed a break.
It was as if the Figi were born for the ragby 7s while the British were still learning to transfer.
That's what it's like.
The British, after half-life, made mass changes and the proportion of the Fiji stopped... for four minutes, which compared to the first half was good until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji Tuis continued to penetrate.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw touchdown in the left corner to increase the an. 36:7. The match was long ago won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans sang on the ochosmies, had flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely dire approach of the Fijis.
In the final moments still, Mata Viliam further attempt to win the Fijans has weakened.
The whistle rang, the Feds hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely down.
Even earlier, the same day of Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 and the United Kingdom in a tight semifinal - by the difference between one conversation.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his brilliant work the foot pierced the defensive line and scored in the second half-life under the hook.
Great late Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of England's 15th team, secured victory - and finally also a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight of a cancer coach to win in the power race
You won't find any more emotional gold on these games - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing outflows, Helen Gloverová and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though two were sitting at the wedding, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship was placed at the level of spraying the second Olympic gold behind it in the women's twin race, there was a voice with them still present by coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport that achieved such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they were not overcome.
What we see - two outstanding athletes, as the water level flies with the elegance of the lab - do not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
For each gold medal of rowing, the Battalion of helpful hands, which a bit by bit mean a difference, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know if he would live this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I've suffered the cancer of the bladder that can be operated, and I've stepped up this operation.
Without an operation, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's about to change your view of things.
The cancer was detected to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio, it was that he could have received treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and thus reduced the fall to a minimum - if we could call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was at the hospital and I walked in peace - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said that a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Being alone is the way, but this was a little more difficult.
Normally, after winning, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual how he tried to handle his own rest.
Stanning, a captain of the royal artillery who has a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions on the bottom, it may be a bit extreme, but it means so much--
Again, it highlights how much this means to me how much Helen and I have worked with Robin as well.
Up until now, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's a huge thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish a better man for training or better coaching.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose one race in five years.
The two set a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning had a very large reserve with Glover.
Maximumly, we focused at a given moment.
Helen shouted: “Do not stop, do not stop.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve anything famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to hang out, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think before they decide what happens next.
Glover's getting married next week, she's on TV with Steve Backshall.
Now she wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about it,\" she said.

Prison?
Rather, be free of charge, says the hunter of Taximafi Rubesh to the breakthrough charge.
Six taxi drivers and former magistrate official in Prague are, as the Czech Republic has said, defendants.
You have filmed a number of reports where you have revealed fraud practices, even those who are supposed to be in a group that will stand before trial.
You've been doing a lot of unpleasant things to do with exposed actors.
How much of a report is there for you to charge the members of the organised group to break down?
I thought there might be a trial.
I'm curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in prison.
That's useless.
They should return all the money they stole.
And they should return them by driving all free people.
That's kind of a self-evident solution.
Does this mean that you don't see any punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one's making a pingle, another to distribute pizza, and one of them totally bailed on it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years of prison.
Is that an adequate rate for you?
I have a problem with freedom generally.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Close someone to jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the societies they took away from her.
For the fourth century, they smelled that our country destroyed their name and robbed people completely.
So now let's do a good card and untie people for free.
I can't imagine it differently.
It would have worked as a public service job.
As someone goes to collect trash, they'd get a car and drive people in Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole after all, and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere else.
He studied at the Film Academy Miroslav Ondříčka in Písek and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
These include people who started in the Czech Republic with virtual videos and videos directly for the site.
He works as a editor for the Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a series of shows, is now preparing Prague Guide, which is primarily designed by foreign audiences.
By means of short reports, Rubesh advises how much services he prefers to avoid and what it recommends to use without concern.
He used to film series with names How to do that, City of fraud?, Life in luxury, and enough! and Praha vs. Prahy.
The prosecution speaks of them as an organized group.
The police have been watching her for months.
Can such a network of underwater cabbies be referred to as Hungarian?
They're such cute mobs, not the kind we know from Kmotra.
It's more of a mob - junior, but the organization is sure.
It's just that they're guarding each other's truffles.
Prague is completely disgruntled.
I observed that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris is not happy with taxi drivers waiting at the Karlovy Lázní (disco club)
Everyone's just watching their seats, and every group's sort of organized.
It's probably a complex network.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate officer who warned the driver before the controls.
As you say, the unwanted ones from the street didn't disappear.
So what percentage is this about between Prague's tax frauds in your estimates?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryyczk.
That's a man who's truly dangerous in his car carrying a telescopic bat, and every Friday and Saturday is at Karl's bridge and a cart of people.
Last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred miles.
His police didn't stop him for a reason.
They only picked a few people out of the whole big group.
However, the same situation is also in other locations in Prague.
Therefore, seven people have been accused of exaggerating a famous Prague nebula, which apparently has much greater dimensions.
Of course, it's nothing.
It'll help, but it's a bad thing to say, that's true.
There are taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists, still in the same places you showed in the reports, then at Karl's Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand every day in these locations, and every day they break the decrees.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's completely indifference.
Businesses of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet, some of them, for only a part of the group, will receive judgment.
It's already broken.
So I have to ask you, do you feel satisfaction?
If I were to take it as satisfaction, it would be wrong because my goal was, it is and will always be to make the centre of Prague better.
And even if I feel like it needs to be a little bit better, I'll continue to do it.
You need to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that's not the case, of course, there's more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in the cabs?
Sometimes I run tests and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way of the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although then he claimed it was 56 crowns (he took advantage of a decimal line trick).
He had a receipt, the cops arrived, and this cab driver was so cute that he was still following those cops, asking them when he finally gave him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxameter has crossed the decimal line and robbed tourists of CZK 357.
Can it be said that even after you showed the faces of those who charged the senseless amounts in short driving, you did not step aside?
Their rudeness is still incredible.
What happened to that cab driver doing at 56 crowns?
The police sent him away with the fact that they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he set up a receipt.
And that will be, I think, the problem in this court (all cabbies and one exorbitant).
On the one hand, there will be a cab driver with his bills, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision, the Magistrate must not use secret records from the taxi vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming the works of their fraud, the taxis themselves pointed out at this precedent.
I always wanted to use the footage to report.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride in six or ten knits a mile, because he wouldn't be alive.
You were talking about a pattern with a decimal line, which, in particular, prior to foreign clients, are carrying underwater taxis.
Is it still up-to-date or are they worried about this job after the publication of your reports continue to use?
I think we've developed this trick by sending the show on the contrary.
I've been driving with one cab driver lately, hiding from me that he's the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that, from the side of the taxameter, a black leopard.
When I asked him what it had there, he said: ‘You know what it is.
If there were no fines for taxi drivers, can a court against their colleagues have a warning?
Is there anything he can do to dissuade them from fraud?
You were talking about how they would always find a way to cheat.
I think there's nothing to take them away.
But someone's out of these places can push them out.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there seriously.
In my experience, I must say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague are always overthinking.
But do they want to go against those who preach the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they're missing a um.
He doesn't have much to do with it and he can't say exactly what he wants.
When the demonstration was organised (for the purpose of the proposal for a full-time restriction from Adriana Krnáčová's office), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said that they didn't protest against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same terms as their service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It occurred that they only blocked Prague, and it only came from the best possible advertising for Uber.
In general, how do you assess the access of Prague magistrate in solving the problem with driving pre-deposit?
It's seen that she had to go into it after the criminal police to solve something.
The Magistrate was short for that.
They had a mole that was leaking information, which means that the taxi department was doing its job for several years completely unnecessary.
I hope that the official will charge all the frozen checks to see what he's done.
That's the worst part of it.
I was even with him on one control ride, which I found out later on their schedule.
It's been a few months since the last parts of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, mostly in foreign viewers, before the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I let them have the videos.
And then when we're going after the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people that are there, they really are.
Famously famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd build a plough around them so that people would look at them.
Communism museum right on the street.
My last question is clear.
You drive a taxi when you need a cab?
Sure.
I drive with services I don't have to pay cash, but a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatches that are fair.
I only took a cab on the street once.
After taking my car, the driver said: ‘Teda, you have the courage,
I'm in the dressing room for an Italian tourist.
The taxi driver's underwater practices were written in 2005.
Some of Paul Bém's primers in the same year went on a check-up ride during the Italian tour, and immediately at the first attempt, the driver went off by two hundred.
Reactor Rubesh had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him for driving from the Old Town Square at the Galleries Square 820 CZK, which is about 195 knits per km, as the authors counted the reports.
Prague magistrate set a maximum price of 28 kroner per km.
There are also additional surprising sums in the filmed report: for example, a two-mile trip from Paris to Truhlářská street cost tourists 400 crowns.
Dear rides also provided taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
Six hundred crowns are charged for driving to Angel, which has two miles [2.5 km].
Mormor is mostly washing clean water, most without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Uncleaned from it goes well, even though sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be drained from the folds.
It's not easy and it's not easy, it's close to a restaurant named Vanes Trost from Oldřichov in Hái.
Klobouk down before her: The tombstone is built by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to come up and find again.
The restaurator should be careful, patient and non-permanent to the working environment, - it has ceased.
It's not far from her first restaurant job.
Thanks to it, there was also a restoration of the stone elements of the fassáda in the back of the frýdlantice hall, the statues of the Holy Marze Magdalena in Zátiš, St. John of Nepomuk in Fýdlanta, Pietu in the Francisdlant Okružní Street, Mariánské column in Frýdlant or atlanta in the front of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
With the reconstruction of Melchior's tomb, Kryštof and Katerina from the Redern began in 2011.
Now, the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the load of impurities and cruelness, the relaxed stone parts are provided against fall and shift; they will either be anchored into the wall or towards each other.
They are also expected to be treated and preserved on the surface.
Texting on the tomb will remarry.
“After that, the State Memorial of the City Office, Frýdlant Věra Sobotová, is about to become a goldstone on marble boards.
There are no records from the past that the tomb would go through some repairs.
With a closer look, they'll take the holes in the marble columns.
It's hundreds of years old, and it's the remains of the tombstone.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the raid of the Swedes for the Thirty Years War, everything disappeared.
Literally, they combed the tomb, noticed Saturday.
In the church Finding the Holy Cross there are restaurantmen with a mild pitch as at home.
After the 2010 flood, it was necessary to put the tombstones that were underwater, to restore themselves to the baptismal, wall painting in the tomb, and now a tomb.
“We would also be able to get into the wind in the future,” declared Sobot.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repair.
Restaurant work on the renewal of the Redernov tomb comes to a total of 128 000 crowns.
They will be taken from subsidies, the city will not put any money into this part of recovery.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winnings of the Historical City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns, then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, explained Mayor Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tomb.
Examples of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indexes and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) in the one month and six months horizon.
Low volatility and growth prevails in markets.
Who would have said that in the beginning of the year.
The U.S. Index S&P500, which has been going through 12% of corrections in February, is now at a new historical maximum and has been assigned 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
In this way, the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks that have finally reached theirs for the long time.
In a situation where the U.S. shares at the historical maximum are so again missed by the volatility that is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets are satisfied and without fear grew thanks to the quantitative release of the US central bank and when the volatility index (VIX) remained stablely below the limit of 12 percent.
And not either.
Even though Fed markets continue to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative releases in Europe and Japan are in full flow and last week it also put its hand on the work of the Bank of England, which will buy a debt of £70 billion in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative release therefore pushes even lower yields and contributes to almost complete risk elimination and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's, of course, a million question.
However, there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without more fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market, and in China it is stabilizing and it is essentially no longer a theme, so we should probably not be too surprised if the US shares continue to remain in such a peaceful regime.
Too bad Junger's not embarrassing Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted this difficult work of experienced policy, said the President of the European Commission, when the French policy (very experienced, because it covered so many different transnational political functions, that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) would be called the European Commission's main negotiator for the terms of departure from the EU of Great Britain.
Younger's selection of signs hope that the EU is in serious interest looking for the British form of future friendly co-exist.
But most British media have accepted Barnier's name as a Juncker war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
Great Britain hates.
As a European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014) he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He only took it as he could: a confirmed enemy of the Anglosian concept of free market and a model of capitalism.
The advocate of multilateral regulation was co-authored by the concept of the so-called banking union and with the will towards everything that came from the London Financial Centre of City, he set up legislation on excessively hard financial regulation and services.
So, this Michel Barnier, Paris's representative in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable, and apparently even a carefree negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how do not remember the calm and friendly distribution of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which it contributed so much to the balance sheet, the overview and the ability of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
Therefore, today Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
It's a pity that Juncker from Václav Klaus did not learn at least in this - he didn't.
It would be for the good of all!
Earthquakes around Putin?
Ruler Kremlu released his loved Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the post of chief of the President's office on Friday.
His place will take Anton Vajno.
She informed the Russian media about the appeal to the Kremlu Press Service announcement.
Putin also indicated that Ivan's release was on his own request.
At the meeting that was passed by Rossija 24, the president said that he was coming to meet Ivan's wishes when he joined the office that he wanted to be the head of the President's office for at least four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his Special Representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange of President's administration, which will now guide Ivanov's representative Vajno, is considered to be quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is referred to as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, held the function of the Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the Government.
The chair of the President's Security Council will now leave.
Ivanov, at his meeting with Putin, claimed that he was a lengthy member of the state chief's administration, actually recordman.
He stayed in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he reminded that in 25 years after its establishment, 11 people had already been represented.
The Kvit or the Debist Strýcová won't play the finale.
So far, neither of the Friday tennis games has been able to change in final participation.
She was the first to lose Petra Kvitová, who followed the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after the 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitová followed also the Czech debutist Šafřevá with Strýcová after a while.
Although in the first set of thousands of sisters of Williams, they lost two hundreds of thousands and the Russians eventually rooted themselves in a short game.
The second hundred then lost the ratio of 4:6.
Half success in Riu's morning program was recorded by Czech rowing: skifař Ondřej Synek won his semifinal when the second Damira Martin of Croatia defeated even over the release in the end almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Son.
It's his opponents, unlike him, they had to fight for progress.
So it took them some strength, and it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing cards for me, says the governor of Prague Ducky.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyková's footsteps.
The five - year - old ambassador occupied her fourth position in today's semifinal, and on Saturday she is waiting for her to start at the B finale and fight for 7th to 12th place.
The gold from London doesn't work that way.
For the first time in the Olympics, I didn't go to the final.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I was driving a good race, and I put everything I could into it.
The jokes were just better, Topinková Knapková bowed down ahead of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get into her fourth games between the elite six.
The fight has given up just before the goal.
I knew the girls were balanced that anyone in this field could move on.
I was surprised by China that she had such a finale.
And I thought I'd be able to move on to the finale.
Unfortunately, today's life race was running, she told the world's masters of 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained a young shooter Philip Nepejchal, who was unable to escape from the qualifier, this time a minor lie.
Nepejal put 33th place in it.
The qualification was best done to the Russians.
From the first line, Sergei Kamenskij joined 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepejal's shot was 620.5 points.
The first time they spoke to the Riu program was the athletes, including the Czech seven fighters Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Kójinová.
Cachová belongs after the second discipline of the Olympic competition 11th place, the Czech recordman Eliška Kójinová is twenty-two-year-old.
She runs Britka Katarina Johnson-Thampson, who jumps to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of historically the best altitude performance within seven rounds.
They were still trying to jump 201 centimeters, but they failed.
Germany, Russia, who's worse?
When we look at absurdity as follows: The German company went through deep seberflexia, but not Russian.
In the 20th century, dictators were present in both great Eurosian nations, and they became able to control the regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible.
The Russian Bolsheviks contributed much to the 94 million victims of communism, which says the Black Paper of communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent conduct of war or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanized about 6 million Jews and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out the animals.
In Germany and the USSR were not only guilty of a few individuals, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or simply cowardly or putting their heads in the sand.
This is not only those nations, we Czechs are like guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came the denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When children were raised, they began to ask: Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?
How could you!
This brought real reflexes and healings to society.
The German elites have recently sought mainly the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the welfare of their citizens.
They now have other (timely naively idealistic) targets, but they certainly don't want to connect it back to Alaska-Lotrinsko or someone - to the revanse - military attack - perhaps they recognize it.
After the Cold War in Russia, no large reflexes occurred.
The window of possible positive changes has definitely been closed to the turn of a thousand years, when a former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin was able to reach power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of the putinovh Russians is the revanš, the age of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people is no value for the faithful.
Woe them, and strangers will fear.
I still believe that it is only those decades of desperate regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valuable - predestined for Asian tyranny.
Who promotes tension growth around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, there has been a deterioration of the situation at the Ukrainian-Rorse border in the area of Crimea.
Who's going to grow the tension?
After the long term of relative peace, there was again further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The municipality of the Ukrainian party became the peninsula of Crimea, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
The reports of both the miscarriage parties will, of course, counter and it is difficult to check independently, so we have the opportunity to only think about the old known question of who it is going to be?
According to the Moscow report, terrorist attacks have occurred on Krym from the Ukrainian side, which is of course refusing Ukraine and, on the contrary, accused Kremlin of provocation.
The information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in Russia came from the case of pilot Savčenko’s known answer that they were allegedly kidnapped in Russia.
If we proceed to the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West, in the form of further confirmation of sanctions and strengthening the anti-circumvention campaign.
In the last year, the background of the immigration crisis to Europe has been paying attention to the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost a completely credit in front of its inhabitants when the current support of President Porosenko is around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long gone bankrupt not to be generous financial injections by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs once again to attract attention to its country so as to justify its further request for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before the voters in their country.
President Porosenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is not only to hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally have their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both of their perverse parties and stop their enemy actions in time.
Bulgaria has shown inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria achieved a monthly inflation rate of 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (from June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 %, so monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the routes of these consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1,7 %), transport (1,8%), culture and recreation (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0,3 %).
The price decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and conventional maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training remained.
The US secret services have been following Russian hack attacks for about a year.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau for Investigation (FBI) announced that he was involved with an attack on the servers of the Party headquarters of Democrats.
However, no official report is mentioned about Russian participation in the attack.
Moscow denied its share of the attack.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret because it would reveal that US secret hacking services are monitoring and exposed to the way they do it and how resources they use it.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack operation.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The Russian tracking material was encoded and only had access to it with a small group of experts, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight chief Members of Congress, called the U.S. gang eight, were informed of public officials.
It consists of the heads of both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan Chambers, the Presidents of Democrats in both Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid Chambers, and four members of the National and Security Committees of Congress.
The President-in-Office of the Democratic Party Donna Brazil announced on Thursday that she was creating an advisory body for cyber security to defend future attacks and to ensure the primary protection of the servers of the Democratic Party.
There was a dangerous parasite in the taken salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's initiative on health problems after consumption of food Losos wild smoked - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, the Prague hygiene control in Albert's shops at the Square and the Bridge.
The inspection found that the L23012562/T4 batch with the consumption date 22.11.2016, which the customer has already indicated, was no longer available, and therefore the product has been removed from the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
Laboratory examinations have been confirmed by the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's a parasitic worm of the grassy seaweed tract.
It is dangerous for a person - the flames in the body and muscle of the fish are a powerful allergen and the man of the grounded living flames can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Štich.
Customers are very sorry for the problems with this brandy product.
We immediately downloaded the above batch from the sale, and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other batches of this item.
The doubt occurred on the supplier's side, which we are dealing with, and at the same time we have allowed this product to be tested, said the New York spokesperson Albert Barbora Vanko.
If the customer has bought this product, he can return it in any of the chains store and get the money back.
Larvy destroys freezing and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was a company called Nekton.
They informed Prague and Central Veterinary Administration about the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server, impenetrable food.cz people after the slaughter of parasites may get sick with an anisakiosis that manifests severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea, or disease can occur without notice, said ČTK.
Symptoms are given an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated fish.
After three weeks after the beginning of the larva disease, most spontaneously leave the venous tract.
Adult worms and larva are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either in sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or during freezing.
The vets have just checked the salmon with the recipient of the imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five samples in them had parasites.
The shipment came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Exported, in total most of the Ahold chain, was 919 packages for today.
At present, the collection of unloaded stocks of the product from the sale takes place, said SVS Petr Pejchal spokesperson on Friday.
Veterinary immediately after finding positive samples, they were not allowed to send other products from the warehouse.
The 17 - year - old Brit wanted to flee the Rokka, apparently killed her with a Russian raid.
After an initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage with a Jihadist who was killed, there was a spitting.
The expected paradise of the chaliphate has turned to hell for the British girls, from which there was no escape.
The girl was related to her sister Halima.
She repeatedly called her and said she wanted to go home.
Leaving Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders without thinking to shoot, quote The Telegraph lawyer of the family of late girls Tasnima Akujee.
The last clues led to the Rokka, the girl called back from there last time.
Then she just lost a message about her death, which she couldn't verify.
Her family communicated to her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they were hoping they'd meet a former student again.
Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house where she was staying was compared to the country's raid in May, said the British ITV News.
The TV added that the bomb had apparently dropped the Russian aircraft that attacked the IS bag in Syria.
You'd take the blue out of heaven just to get your child out of a dangerous area, tell Tasni Akujee, family lawyer.
At the week when (Kadiza) she was thinking about escape from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was caught trying to escape and, according to the information available, was publicly beaten to death.
I think she put it down as a warning and decided not to risk it, according to the BBC Akujee.
A family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and his 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum School and Amira Abas went on their way on the 17th of February last year.
The only thing they said at home is they're going out.
However, they headed to Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey to the territory of the IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadizu back.
You'd take the blue out of heaven just to get your baby out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could, drive all the power to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without the risk of being caught alone, he added a lawyer.
The only positive thing he says is that the fate of Kadizy can serve as a desperating case for other girls or boys who will let Islamic propaganda be misled.
“There are many cases when people went out there, they realized how things were going there, they understood how much different it was from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and they wanted to come back,” he continued Akujene.
The fate of the Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
However, since they have also been silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the country center and the headquarters of the Dukes of Argill.
Since the mid - 18th century, courts and basements were held at the town hall as a local prison.
The conditions in which the criminals were left were pathetic, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them and successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison space to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more attractive to prisons, had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it has not been in operation long enough, it has been concluded for economic reasons since the smaller repair facilities have been expensive to operate and have not been paid too much.
The stories of criminals and the chase for ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened about a century later, visitors can compare an old building with new ones to see how different conditions exist in them.
Guiders in daily costumes authentic experience still strengthen.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishments were applied to criminals, whether it was a breaking of fingers or burning signs on the body.
In the context of the tour, tourists can be locked into one of the cells, mostly due to photographs of memory, or to create a feeling behind bars that live in prisoners.
Besides, there's an Inveraray prison of one of the most famous Scottish locations where it's supposed to be haunted.
There have been several groups of paranormal activity hunters, and today the museum allows people to come up with ghosts to hunt.
But that night will be 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns in the count.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village attracts great food, surrounding panoramics and history.
‘Animé - the effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animated, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and to deal with the identity of ways that border absurdity.
You can make ananas, dog or character out of you, which as if it came out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality, and every day generate more than 30 million improved selfies.
Any mistake will immediately be published.
The Snappchat filters in the past have earned criticism of the charge that the application promotes blackfacting or that it supports white shades of skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when the users offered this week a filter that made their eyes shrouded, teeth curved and blown faces, some critics referred to it as racist Asian caricatures - “yellowfaces, ”
And they asked whether these repeated questions show no evidence of the greater problem of society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and anger spread quickly and Snappchat said that he cancelled the function the next day.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended to express accounts to the characters of the animated characters, not as Asian caricature.
But the observers who witnessed racism, the filter attracted painful stereotypes in action.
The others, without the cover, refused to compare to the animated.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in an e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing--
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of obvious Asian cartoons and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is touched into a gloomy extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from a sitting hall in corporations to Holywood and a device that we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racial diversification than their older partners - can mean that they can be expected to be even more sensitive.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” said Katie Zhuová on Thursday in an interview, “it is very difficult to care about these things today without notice, as it was earlier, ” he said.
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to erase his account on Snapchat and invite others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and on the phone, she stated that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the overly white, completely male company leadership, and the article ended with a hash tag: # Put downSnapchat.
“It is either because there are no diversity and colored people among employees at the time when they decide these things,” said Zhuová, who has a Chinese-American origin, “or colored people work there, but not on positions to feel safe or pleasant to speak“
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat had largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees with the fact that it has a private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesperson, she recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on the population under-represented and internal management of the incluse.
Zhu adds: “I’m wondering if they really need any other such users who can say that it’s not okay,” she says.
Military officers have disabled intelligence about IS, says Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee in the report on Thursday stated that officers from the Central Command of the United States have changed reporting on intelligence services to draw up a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than what they have provided the events from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the working group drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence and Defence Sub-committee, “a comprehensive dissatisfaction has been identified - among the analysts of the Central Intelligence Services, according to which their superiors have changed their assessment of US efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Commanding, known as the CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, which supervised U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In the press release, the report states: “The results of intelligence services approved by the superior Centcom officers usually offered a more beneficial picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than they were confirmed by the facts on the ground and were more consistent than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our warriors are damaged when the superior policy makers have submitted a misinterpreted analysis,” said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
A failure in Centcom's leadership is at the top of the organization.
In the 10-page report, the continuing central staff problems are described in detail in the description and analysis of US efforts in the training of Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the leaders of Obama administration have ordered the reports to be amended, it is stated in the report that analysts have felt that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present an optimistic view of the dangers presented by the Islamic State or the IS.
‘In the first half of 2015, many Central Staff Press Reports, statements and statements from the Congress were substantially more beneficial than what events were actually,’ the report states.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly stated that a major military attack on Mosula could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
\"This is very clear after months of the investigation,\" said Member Mike Pompeo, the representative of the Republican Party of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015 they manipulated the highest position of reporting staff of the U.S. Central Staff with the results of reporting services in order to required the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans have compiled a working group after they have learned about the concerns of analysts about the fact that intelligence information relating to the Islamic State is manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, further investigation must follow a more detailed examination.
There is still another investigation conducted by the Secretary-General of Defense at Centcom's intelligence services.
The Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some conclusions of the working group of Republicans.
“For 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very close process for the compilation of information evaluation on IS and Iranian security components,” said Mr Adam B. Schiff, President of the Committee and the representative of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff’s words, this process “has resulted in overcrowding the output of intelligence services,“ damaged the morale between analysts and “inadequately taking into account the disgruntled views. ”
However, Schiff and Democrats claim that they have not found any evidence that the White House would try to push on the analysts of Centcom to adjust their conclusions according to “the priorities or political situation”,
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times informed about the ongoing investigation of the General Inspector Pentagon, which was launched following complaints of Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, spokesperson of the Pentagon, declared that the Ministry of Defence would not comment because the investigation of the general inspector is still continuing.
However, he stated that “the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security,” he stated.
The investigation has implications beyond whether Americans are bombarded in Iraq and Syria are successful (a year which is now declaring a growing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's charges have been raised by the questions regarding how much President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Staff honestly evaluates military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The crisis of reporting about the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than ten years, when the analyst of intelligence services of Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - advocated a small unit in Iraq and devoted only a little time of thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team had concluded that despite the public declaration of repetition, air strikes led against the Refinery of the Islamic State did not weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group, since the group had built temporary refineries and oil sales on the black market.
The Times in September informed us that the findings had not been transmitted outside the central staff.
Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subject to criticism last year after many legislators found the testimony of the Senate too positive by the evaluation of the war.
General Austin resigned in April, and in Centcom he replaced him with Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won the fourth match in the ground hockey game, so today it will play a decisive game in the Great Britain team.
Katie Bam in a fight against Japan, who ended up winning 6:1, shot three goals and only a day later for the American team of ground hockey shot the first two goals of the game in which America beat India 3:0.
Five goals in two games is a good memory success, but Bamová (27) said that she was not sure that she had ever been able to do something like this.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I don't belong to those who write their goals.
This, however, knows: Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 matches and share their first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after Japan's defeat 2:0 remained undeserved.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last round game.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter final and the match will decide who of the six teams will end up in the first and who in second place.
The team from the first place will move a little longer to strong Danes who are at the head of the second group.
Whatever Saturday's gonna end, Americans here in their surprise ride started out, four years after they ended up with 12 teams in London.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the hockey on the ground first took her hand when she was 3 years old (the older twin sisters played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The Olympics escaped in 2008 because they didn't get to the final signature.
Then came the year 2012, when she wasn't very successful or even members of her team.
The next year he was appointed English coach Craig Parnham and things started to change.
\"Cultual change, mental change, physical change,\" said Bam.
We didn't have the pace of working in London that we have today.
We've made a complete turnover.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half of shooting the gate with a beekend nearby.
India entered the game without winning the tournament, but the team appeared surprisingly hard and kept score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter when Bamová took advantage of the opportunity.
She missed the left side of the playing field, then slipped into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in every three wins, was the first one at the tournament.
She's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
“Now we are in a good place,” said Parnham, but how good it is, it will depend on the result of the Saturday game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of Olympic whitening
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's an olympiad.
From the event in Rio de Janeiro, it is felt persistent, unwritten, and captured by altering competition and efforts.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a hot strategic plug that's passed away from a boat shooter, gymnast and triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper or listen to your neighbor's interview at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Balles, Katie Ledek or involuntary between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley is.
Dooley, the upcoming lover of women with dolls in their faces, is on the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names are in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and spots of sponsors if he were a swimmer, gymnasto or even a sermier.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California is fighting for Olympic gold in the jumps on the trampoline.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine at all races anyway.
The distance from Wednesday, a bit in the shade are sports that are not generally recognised: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule long.
But if I may name my extraordinary favor, let me draw attention to the insignificant charm of the trampoline.
Although they've been jumping on the trampoline with Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first mentioned in Sydney games, after 16 years of intervention this sport almost without notice - a lot of people I asked about, and didn't even know it was Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The USA has never obtained a medal in the horses on the trampoline, and until 2012 none of the athletes got to the finale.
The prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be warning Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The trampoline jumps have some more bad luck, partly because the ear of the unfamiliar would seem to be more suited to the clown university than to the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but only an enthusiast following from the country.
It has comic potential - comic vibrations of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combines itself.
The word ‘trampolina’ is derived from the Spanish ‘el trampolín’, which means ‘skokan board’.
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them up to nearly 10 meters high, and submits compositions with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic Programme, they are evaluated according to the implementation, difficulty and “airtimes”
In Rio, twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual trajectories of the Olympic track is ahead.
Fighters of the Gold Medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, another time there and back, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only with the target tape or the starting wall, but as the television news states, they will also have another thought line: the world or the Olympic record.
This unanimity effort is nobles, admirable, a bit fantastic - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's kind of exhausting at the same time when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumps on the trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The track of the athletes on the trampoline is up.
The idea is not to move forward.
He or she's reflected as if they were in a state without burden like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and, of course, it is not difficult to do this, but for the duration of the assembly, there is no violent struggle to achieve the goal, no distance measurement, but only a perfect, good timing and gravity.
This is the closest ever to the Olympics and the zen coming.
The qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 hours of eastern time, then the male competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, which starts for both days at 14 o'clock.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a peaceful, pleasant moment that you will probably overlook through the rest of the fight.
And if it's only as the men's athletes will be subject to in love with their eyes and rites - as Wall Street Journal has recently designed the US gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for their new fans who are in the air.
“Protesting generations in Ethiopia, the United States of America’s long-term allies
Strong protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators requesting political changes in Ethiopia have encountered a violent resistance to the government.
Witnesses claim that many protestors were shot during the conflict with the police.
Is there a threat in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a firm Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the last few months, the country has been engulfing counter-governmental concerns that spread to more and more areas.
Only in the last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets who demand fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unfaithful.
Witnesses say the police were shot and killed by unarmed demonstrators.
At the collating video recordings of protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, the members of security forces are captured, as young young people of the locals were forced to stand by the walls.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now asking for thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and make a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, Head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most human nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopans to eliminate the danger of terrorist attacks in the area, especially in Somalia, and few from African countries, if any, obtain such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - even a new suburban train is in the capital of Addis Abeba.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without a determination speaks about government repression - the opposition in the country has been pushed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been suspended, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
“If you are suffocating people, and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break,” said Seyoum Teshome, who transferred to the University of Central Ethiopia.
He'll test all the youths.
She's been testing the whole generation.
The difficulty is many, and it concerns everything from the disputes of the land to the absolute control of the power of the reigning coalition.
After last year's elections, which have been widely criticized, she obtained a ruling party and her allies of the last chair of the crushed opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, pressure rises at the border with Eritrea. On this unmarked border, the disputed border requested hundreds of lives in June.
Anyitarians fear that the separatist groups which have been more or less oppressed over the past years, such as the Oromic Exclusion Front or the Ogaden National Exclusion Front, can try to exploit confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now, after years of application under the surface, these bitter feelings have burnt again.
The first one is apparently harmless: smart phones.
Many Etiopans can communicate through social networks up to the last few years when they have become commonly available cheaper smart phones and have improved the provision of Internet services.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as it is normally happening during protests, many people can still communicate via the Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Etiopans talked about how they went to protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
After the long ages of Amhar, mostly of the Christian tops of Ethiopia, they disappeared into politics and trade and used the Oromas, many Muslims and live in lowlands.
But that's changing too.
“We are on our way to a united leadership,” said Mulat Gemech, the leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in the areas covered by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is an illegal dominant of the members of the Tigray ethnicist, which consists of around 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for concern is the death of Miles Zenawi.
Zenawi, former leader of rebels, was the Egyptian Prime Minister for the entire 17 years until his death in 2012, when he claimed unidentified diseases.
He was considered a tactical genius to be a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterfully able to reveal the initial signals of dissatisfaction and use the ambassadors to process and gain on his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, the analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemaria Desalegn, was pulled out of relative uncertainty in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigraian region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts claim he has no confidence in the security services of the Tigres.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
Ethiopia was the last to experience such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts marked as the election that the government took and stole.
He followed a hard hit during which many protesters were killed - although less than in recent months - and this period of anxiety passed relatively fast.
Experts for development appreciated the leaders of Ethiopia for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and the measurable progress in combating poverty.
It is clear, however, that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protesters in the Amhar City of Gondar attacked business companies owned by Tiggers and the grudge against the Tigres on social networks are becoming more common.
Analysts say that protests build into the uncomfortable situation of the United States and other Western allies.
The US Government uses Ethiopia as a base for the transshipment of drones over neighboring Somalia, although recently stated that the base was closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall in such a constant area.
“This,” said Abdi, “is a very sharp edge of blades.
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and the financing of the IS as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to bagatelize the latest controverzi that floods his campaign by declaring that he did not really mean it when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders - terrorist groups of Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions regarding the capacity of the Republican candidate for the President to speak clearly with the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward situation, who have fought him hard in the stormous times and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
After this proposal at the meeting Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, and in interviews he insisted that he did not really intend to say that President and H. Clinton's IS had created.
However, in the Twitter contribution on Friday morning, Trump declared that he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of an old claim only one day that Trump said in several interviews that he meant seriously.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease his comment by reminding that Obama was seeking to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not react to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment that Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy while his preferences are dropping in pre-election surveys.
Trump and Clinton took part in Michigan duel this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on this subject.
He once again warned Twitter that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes and said that according to him her speech was boring.
Trump used the defense sarcasm earlier.
At the end of July, when he calmed down the wave of criticism, when he concluded with the proposal that the Russians should enter the e-mails of Clinton, he later explained: “I am, of course, sarcastic.
This approach allows Trump to push the borders of political statements and to measure them as necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction then one or the other way “after the explanation,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he's in his statements, and he knows that they're weighty enough to explain them differently.
Since the results of the pre-election surveys continue to fall in his favour, Trump has chosen even more generous tone in recent days, instead of peaceing matters for general voters.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump was with great distance to Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his criticisms of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But together with the fact that Trump is facing increased attention during the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes put in an awkward situation for his dedicated followers who have to stand behind him, however provocative his remarks.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of the most prominent Trump followers, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in an interview for CNN.
“I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment,” said Giuliani, when he was asked to the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that the IS was almost unknown before Obama, a small organization that was completely called the new guy, and it occurred because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama’s government, in which Clinton acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs, has allowed the IS to wake up and fail to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to blow fire around himself on Twitter for passing every word of it and being taken against him.
He laughed at “the poor, the patethical, the TV scholars who tried to understand it, and said: “This can’t be done. ”
A few Democrats have been wrong about Trump's apology that it's just another evidence that he's not eligible for the Presidency.
The coffee shop is being drained from the price market.
There was a lovely place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it occurred to her being pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop that has replacedVerb in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the shape of cakes.
Locals have been crying about it as the last loss of growing cities.
She wrote: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea’s hotel is filled out and there’s a soap shop fromVerb.
But if New York is a change, then it's also rediscovering.
The Verb Cafe was opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
New Verb has a wifi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the original employees working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good too.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original coffee shop, who is also owner and CEO of a new place.
InVerb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay him a transfer to a new place, he said he'd do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things just as they were.
Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same model of espresso machines.
He even re-uses the lights from the old Verbu.
Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu offers sandwiches with ham, eggs and cheese and toppings, such as hoods and fried onions.
You will also find bowls with brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer gives you beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant tide of the original stamgasts.
“A number of original customers also had to leave Williamsburg because of prices,” he said.
Last Sunday was one of those customers, Rebecca Olive.
Mrs. Olive (34) lived in Williamsburg and went toVerb Cafe often.
Even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said when he closed the door, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
\"I found out what I love is coffee and culture in Verbu,\" she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she gave a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been going to Verbu since 2003.
They go before work and order the same thing all the time.
“In the fourth and eight every day, as a watch, I will come and prepare my swing with everything and with butter,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he's got some bacon, eggs and ham on his own.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, Soap Cherie's owners offered him that they would make a special soap for Verb and use a filter coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
“I think we could still use it,” Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint coffee also accepted well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Poland and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place soon to set it up to make his new neighbors feel like home.
A new place has other advantages.
Local fruit juice manufacturer wants to turn into a bottle and sell a filtered coffee.
A coffee shop is offered to expand to the neighboring building.
A lot of customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr Whitt says when the coffee shop opened again, walk in and have coffee is like coming home.
\"I missed the smell,\" he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in “Square Meal”
Shortly after joining the President's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in Oval at work and lunch.
President Roosevelt had a taste in selected dishes from the 5th avenue, like a bar of goose livers and Mary's turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs on a devilish way in a paradise sauce, potato pyré and as a dessert plum poodle.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered,” said Jane Zeegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also the message of the Americans to eat. ”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are dedicated to the gastronomy history.
Andrew Coea’s last book “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book “97 Orchard” tells the story of living on Lower East Side by food.
Their new joint work \"A Square Meal\" published on Tuesday is the history of the American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and their reporters met for dinner at the Eisenberg trade with sandwiches, a small, hard buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the time of the crisis since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with smoked olives, Andrew (57) had turkeys, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
Reporter ordered a mass carbrance that, according to a couple, he had a great interest in talking about food during the crisis.
“Careers were very popular,” said Ms. Ziegelman.
He was selling peanut, liver and beans.
They were made of this compound and other cheap foods that the ingredients set up.
Stop the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe has gone mad.
“They would be like lead in your stomach, ” he said.
In years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet of snow, which you eat.
Women's teams have cooked for farmers from the farm and breakfast, lunch and dinner they served freshly cooked pie.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war. “A Square Meal is watching what ways the nation compared with the fact that this was not a land of abundance.
“It was the time when the food became a central, feared point for the American people,” said Coe to explain why he and his wife decided to write about it.
In the same way, the new budget diet was covered: The mysterious dishes, like carbanas and food from cast irons, cast irons like “the amazing way to use the rest,” Ziegelman noted, because the cooks could hide non-steelic ingredients under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after years the central point of the American food - has become a cost-effectively assigned luxury.
Strange mixtures that were supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional supplement were preferred to flavors or even a sound sense in cooking.
During the surveys for the book, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared daily meals from baked onions filled with peanut butter.
“It was not a popular addition to the evening table,” Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: “It was surrealist.
The peanut butter with the bread onion doesn't come together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - between them Louise Stanley, a series of federal office for the domestic economy between 1923 and 1943 - followed the eating habits of the country.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over budget cuts, and goggles, such as creamy spaghetti with carrots, to convert them into delicious food.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, the desserts were created in the reply of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s fastening “I’m going to make a pie.
While he publicly praised the simpleTSl farm kitchen of his childhood, he was a select millionaire who became one.
“The river ate continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce, ” said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a almost golded room, had a tuxedo on him.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor did not allow him to follow an example of her own stomach.
As the book tells you, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House “not only giving almost the most precious food in all of Washington, but also the most unhappiestly prepared -
A number of dietary habits from the time of the crisis have taken place as soon as the country has once again turned on its feet.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
A couple say that during writing books they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - maybe why she couldn't throw out the food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food, ” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: “The people were wrong about it.
There was an oatmeal accident.
When they were at Eisenberg's clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert that they prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum cream,” Ziegelman said and added that the usual trick was to give the humble recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and shells.
Everyone's been trying to hurt a spoon into a dense brown matter.
It was surprisingly bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then once again.
And as the right manager, he said to his wife: “It would be good for a bit of meat-wrecked flagmen.
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most refugees who are rolling into Europe are coming for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what shows would look like if we shot them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us makes fun of their native country.
With the help of the photoshop, they create collages that funnyly show how it would look if the famous series and films were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to pay the cost for legal representation in the case of a patent against the C-type helium against the Merck company
The judge of the district court decided that Gilread Science Inc is entitled to pay fees for lawyers that were incurred in the process of patenting the C-type jaundice against the manufacturers of Merck & Co Inc.
In June there was a breach of the judgment by which Gilead had to pay 200 million for damage due to the violation of two patents of Merck in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge repeatedly discovered illegal conduct on the side of Merck, apart from another lie under oath and other unethical practices.
The Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a review of the fees incurred in connection with the representation of the case.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the market for new generations against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck were suing each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead medicines.
Americans supported military troops claim they have received full control over the city of Manbíž
The military units supported by the USA have received full control over the northern city of Manbíž near the border with Turkey after the last battlers of the Islamic State fled the city, said a spokesperson on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) now the city is suffocating after leaving the rest of the radical group hiding in the city.
The troops freed over 2,000 civilians that radicals held, said the Reuters Sharpen Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbíže military council.
“The man is now fully under our control, but we are still looking for him,” said Agent Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton published her tax confession for 2015, which stated that the Presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had income of $10.75 million in that year and took a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton devoted $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation). He contributed to the Bill Clinton Expansion for a share of almost honorary money worth $ 5.3 million for lectures, and the former foreign minister admitted income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her activities at the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's fellow candidate, American Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, along with Anne Holton's wife, released a tax confession in 10 years.
These in 2015 paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain are still a role model for financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawing from his previous promises that he will make his tax confession public.
It is customary that candidates for the President of the United States will disclose their tax confessions, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the US Treasury Ministry as a reason for his refusal to make a tax award public.
“Your move,” said Hillary Clinton’s campaignant on Twitter and referred to the democratic candidate’s tax confession.
Michael Cohen, Special Trump's advisor, said on Thursday, CNN, that Trump would not allow his tax confession to be published until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, among which the Republican candidate for the 2012 President Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, business transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is making a strong appearance on the question and published a video on Friday, which reminds how high the position of the Republic of Trump insists that he publish his tax confession.
On Thursday, he mentions the question in his speech on the economic issues in Michigan.
“It refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidency have been doing for decades - to publish their tax confessions,” she said before people.
The Politico organization stated that Trump paid no or very low taxes over the last two years, and the publicist of New York Times quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claimed it could be so at present.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton advocates a rule named after the billionaire Warren Buffet, which would ensure that all who earn more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet called Trumpa to meet and exchange tax confessions in Omaze, Nebraska, where Buffy's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway.
Buffett also said that he went through the IRS audit and that Trump “be afraid,” the Financial Office, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign published tax return until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average in 2007 to 2014, paid a federal tax on average of 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton tax confession shows that unlike most Americans, they make only $100 wages in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund from which Clinton was receiving dividends and losses of $190,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature guards in Tanzania use a non-ortoxic way to prevent elephants from walking into human dwellings - throw condoms filled with chili powder.
This process has proved itself and the Honeyguide Foundation, who came with the idea a few years ago, together with the American ecological organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and train volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzán, as with the help of this inviolable procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Many of them used copies in their defense earlier.
Friday is the world's day of elephants, which is dedicated to protecting these animals.
“ Since they have developed this... set of instruments, we have noticed a change in behavior in these communities. People believe that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in the statement.
The first and the second step is to light a battery in the passing elephant and run the klakson.
If he doesn't, he'll be fired by the so-called “the chilli blaku“
Chilli powder mixed with salt and pepper wrapped into a condom, its end is covered in a way that can only be seen by a piece.
When the condom is set off, the fine powder from the chilli will blow up.
Most of all, one puzzle and an elephant is going to come out in a different direction.
The last option is to launch fireworks that trigger a loud, bright explosion.
The Jewish director drunk himself to the Berlin Hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to “the demand of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin has launched a break-up in the media after he found out that the Kampinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the words of the staff on the basis of “the request of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary image on the Holocaust “Shoah”, vented his frustration from the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel call code list.
However, the state was not mentioned among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 he was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers instead the opportunity to call Israel via its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and he turned to the reception of the hotel with the problem.
The answer that he received, Lanzmann, says, “She shocked ”
The hotel’s staff replied that the measure was ‘ decided after taking into account Kempinski Hotels’’’ management
The director's reason for this step was even more regrettable.
“ Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel’s call code be deleted,” quoted Lanzmann’s employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Ambassador of Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred the case to “a great shame. ”
We were scared and shocked.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain is even greater shame.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” he said.
The event caused a strong online reaction, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply lost its customers in the requirements of Arab customers.
“Hanba you,” says another contribution that points out that the hotel located in Kurfurstendam’s noble street is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel’s daily hotel itself, any accusation quickly came from the fact that the event marked “review,” and Lanzman said,“ he spoke to him. ”
‘Never has been given a direct command - not including Israel in the call code list, quoted Suddeutsche Zeitung as a representative of the Hotel Kempinski.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber designs against protesting Brazilian students
Students and police met in Brazil's San Paul on Thursday when students met at the demonstration against government reform in the public education system.
The police used tear gas against protesters and rubber designs.
The problem was when government law enforcement tried to move students, which ended up using rubber and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students in order to express their concerns about plans.
Between San Paulo Gerald Alckmin's proposals to save money, almost hundreds of public schools and the transfer of 300 000 students are also closed.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spraying on the wall against temporary President Michel Temer.
The most recent protest comes only a few days after demonstrators made their way to the streets to support President Dilmy Roussef when the Senate decided to sue her in the country.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryana increased by 70.9 percent after the cancellation of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the Ambassador stated, since international sanctions against Iran have been repealed, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies restore existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Dhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's export to Iran fell by 91.5 percent and reached $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to USD 158 million.
The jump increase in trade has provided supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” said the ambassador.
Dhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas to the citizens of Iran, mostly travel visas.
Moreover, Iran was first reached between the top of 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome,” he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where they are well preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization,” he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British got gold in the cycle.
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in the male team sprint at the Rium velodram when the VB team trio voted for London 2012.
A three-year-old native from Glasgow was in the role of the brake that he took for his Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend pleased when he reached his goal and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth at the world championship in the track cycle in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for Jamie Staff's specialised initial racer.
Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye left, there was also a place he tried to fill out Kian Emadi and Matt Crempton.
Skinner was a man of British trainers and the search for potential has now confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was along with Hoy champion four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualification, but the tricot took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was a little behind his bike, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of the strategy was a large part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy race watched the BBC commentator's position and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped up on the stage, did not let their eyes off.
Three - year - old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.
I'm here to get the best of myself and to honor my name.
We created an Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After triumphing next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012 Hindes admitted that he fell on the track on purpose after the weak start.
A sign later he pulled back and Britain’s opponents had no chance to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all those British flags on the bleachers I felt like in London,
In the last three months, we've all been like a team of cheeses.
We lost in many world races, so once again winning the Olympics is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation who won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is supposed to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have a successful five days waiting for us on the velodram.
With the form that Kenny has demonstrated, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win at one Olympic three gold medals simultaneously.
This would be exactly for Kenny - who is 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date appears to be sacred to British sports, on this day it celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - it meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy got.
As another, Kenny will participate in the sprint that starts today and takes another three days.
The 18 - year - old native of Bolton said: “I'm enjoying this one now.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight’s title--
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull have qualifyed as the fastest for the racing team race for four kilometers.
They're done with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) are held today in the second day of the race for which the Dosier will focus on the Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifier race, he debated with the Commissioner when the referee invited him to measure his height.
In a similar race of women who continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trottová, Joanna Rowsell Shandová, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia world record with time of 4:13.260.
The VB team was relying on its powerful team of track cycling and controlled the middle season of Olympic games and won a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances, showing a complete advantage in Beijing and London, the expectations have decreased during the preparations for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events were developed, last but not least the withdrawal of the technical director Shane Sutton in April due to sexualism and discrimination charges, and the termination of the whale careers such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the competitions on the velodrum seems to be a legendary reputation that the UK team can produce excellent performance with perfect timing, could again confirm.
Insecure future in Portland after the end of the contract for energy supply
The future of the Portland tariff aluminium in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - are uncertain about the electricity supply plant that provides electricity and which informed one of the owners of the taviar contract on electricity supplies. It is expected that all contracts on electricity supply will be reduced.
This step occurs after the Government of Victoria’s State has previously decided that it will not extend the provision of subsidies that undertakings maintain in the course of the course.
The validity of the 20-year-old subsidy expires in November.
Alcoa Portland can be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
Up to 2000 jobs, direct or indirect, may be jeopardised when closing.
And since the rolling stock consumes around 10 percent of total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be further lavinity effects.
Alcoa closed down Point Henry in 2014, leading last year to the closure of Angesea power plant.
Alcoa's wine company in Portland is commercial and threatens to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation regarding the future of the company, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to prices for the production of the plant.
AGL, which provided a large aluminium factory from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latobe Valley, declared that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture, small commercial shares holding CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects that the Dutch plant will continue to operate, in other words, that the challenge for electricity will continue,” she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so called ‘certificate contracts’ which were to enter into force since November 2016.
The contracts have 12 months notice period, so their validity will actually end in 2017.
\"AGL continues to assume that contracts will participate in profit for the fiscal year 2017\", declared the power plant.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to a strong outlook on the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of USD 187 million “in case the contract would have been terminated”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate “the impact on its ... ability to operate the wine market or to secure electricity supply to the rolling mill”
The US company stated that in 2010, Loy Yang had concluded a contract for 20 years, which had started to pay since November this year, even though she had to explain why she had resigned from the contract.
Analysts are very careful when it comes to the possible closure of the port tavírna in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to weak economies in the sector.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes around 600 megawattts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawattts every year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the market [electric energy].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the star of real estate TV show Kardashianová - now is the cover of the shining Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the mother-manage clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the headline page of the September edition of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Ambassador of Estee Lauder's brand, who performed at a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, when I look at this title page, she wants to cry,” Kendall wrote.
The detection of the title page followed by the bizarre (or simply the continuation of humors in the submission of Cardashian?) the stage in which the whole family of the Cardashian-Jenners (bar trackers Rob and Caitly and along with them all the favorite Swiss uncles, the Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters forgot only so that the scene could end with a classic turnover: preparing a secret party.
It is a covert storyline of almost every “birthful“ work of the children’s television show (Seacrest says: “You thought that we had forgotten on you, with sincerity of the pictured rabbit on the show at 8:00 a.m.), but Christ somehow needed to make sure that other girls in this public could feed themselves.
Because when we look at the September number of Vogue magazine, we definitely entered the new Kardashian era.
Senior sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on Vogue's cover (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September edition of the magazine is another league.
The September edition of Vogue magazine is the most sold number all year round.
The publication, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that from 832 pages in last year's edition there were 615 advertising pages).
The discovery of the star, which appears on the front page, is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have disappeared before it was published.
Women who have appeared in the past on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been more “certificate that modeles are doing“ than the models that are celebrities. ”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's owner and Dior Ambassador, appeared in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - a magazine described as “the first model of the first category will fall into the first category, it will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor stars of real estate shows, or children of today who know how to make a well-groomed video (even though Jenner represents all of this).
They are provenly talented women who appear in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of Lemonade's album.
Of course not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult for her participation in reality show.
Stephanie Seymorová, the original model Victoria's Secret criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them “the whores of the moment.
These feelings were getting hot again with the news that Jenner would appear on Vogue's cover.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of a shining Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's showing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own pywalls.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures for the LVE magazine.
And in free moments, she's doing a reality show, maybe just like one of the ways to see Kourtney and her kids.
The International Centres of Legal Assistance will reject 160 000 people annually
More than 160 000 most vulnerable citizens are denied Community legal assistance every year, and in the sector alone, they are on impact, which will have further restrictions on the funding of already overfished services.
In Queenslad, three of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, threats to workers, victims of violence, and people with no funds to combat unfair eviction and so on - are being rejected at the moment when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Communication legal services, which are already so tight to crack, are going to take further cuts.
Since June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
According to the latest summary report of the National Community Centre for Legal Assistance, five thousand people were found to be rejected every year.
Mr Farrell said that without the abolition of the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
“The judicial centres in Queenslad are chronicly sub-financed, meaning that thousands of people are denied vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relations with a rapist, people with excessive and stunning debts, families passing through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government has reduced its funding by 30 percent, which will lead to thousands of people at risk from Queenslad who will have to be aware of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the D.A. and Senator Queenslad George Brandise to immediately prevent this shortening of finance from getting people the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the Government of the State has fulfilled its commitment to finance legal aid until the level of national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the community centres of legal assistance and the community of their clients and the Palestinian government must invest in this important work.
The appeal to Donald Trump's campaign after a staff member allegedly directed the weapon
New York: Donald Trumpa's campaign was filed for alleged ineffectiveness after they were told that the head of operations in North Carolina in February aimed a weapon at a staff member during a jeep ride.
The incident was described in a court file, which was handed over by Vincent Bordin at the Center of the State Court in Charlotte, a former software schooler of the campaign in the state.
Bordini said that he waited for months to resolve the situation internally before he concluded that “this will not happen. ”
Principal Earl Phillip “signor marked the gun, gave the right finger on the trigger and directed Vincent's head to the jaw”, said Bordini in the lawsuit.
It states in the file that Bordini, following complaints with local and regional campaign leadership, found that at least four other people have experienced the same thing with Phillip.
‘The weapons need not fire to cause harm,’ says Bordini in the lawsuit.
The appeal comes only two days after the Republican candidate for the president called for a delay when voters in North Carolina said that they could enter into the owners and holders of weapons (which is modified in the second supplement of the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and will be able to appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says that the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump didn't defend violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit asks for a compensation campaign for careless supervision and from Phillip for threats to personal security, illegal use of violence and emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks did not react immediately to the comment request.
Trying to get a statement from Phillip was unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local branch of Charlotte's intelligence, announced that Phillip had left the campaign recently.
Phone call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services no one has reacted in a short period of time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump leads a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is extremely attractive, just like London 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
Olympic games meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new teaching sites, 40,000 new jobs and end up with youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As before London's Olympic in 2012, there will also be those who will think the expansion of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The divers were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out they weren't right.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure in which many people and companies are involved, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of EUR 211 billion, to leave the heritage in the form of skills and jobs both in the vicinity of the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which, in the term and established by budget, introduced an infrastructure investment programme for £11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world for five years, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most disturbing dates in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver the third morning, worth £16 billion of private investment.
Games in London in 2012 were a huge success in Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to continue spreading the spirit of the Olympic Games and extending Heathrow, to ensure trade into the future and to leave the legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of Britain.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy for Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on cat and mouse in blocking ads
From the attempts to bypass advertising blocking programs, for companies that make money on online marketing, the game has become a cat and mouse. At least, it says one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, therefore, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a post on its website, stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-lock the advertising on this social network.
Facebook on Tuesday stated that its desktop website will change the encoding around advertising to make advertising filters more difficult to find out which parts of the site are advertised.
Adblock now claims that the new codes have already gone up.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog’s contribution that “this kind of war between the open source of advertising blocking community and those who try to bypass them lasts since the advertising block was invented,” and that Facebook probably comes with another own repair.
The fact that a company with the largest social network in the world has engaged in war just shows how much the problem of blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe have made use of advertising filters around 200 million people in the world - almost four times that in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the profits from advertising on Facebook, every day Facebook from mobile devices will visit 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said that the company is against the advertising filters on desktop because mobile advertising filters on the mobile application for the social network and Instagram are not working.
Advertisings on the desktop still represent profit enough to make Facebook decide to invest in it.
On Tuesday, Facebook also stated that it would update the tool for “depositing advertising” (ad preferences) to give people the opportunity to better control how advertising is displayed to them.
On Thursday Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are concerned because they could also block content that does not relate to advertising.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” said Facebook spokesperson in an e-mail statement.
The blocking of advertising is an insensitive tool, so we'd rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that will control people.
A woman hit a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for an event that was taken over by a woman who was probably trying to commit suicide on the highway of several cars on Thursday morning.
There was an accident on the A1 motorway near the Morges in the Vaud Canton shortly after midnight in number.
In Vaud's statement, the police declared that the actor “was lying in the dark on the road and transferred a few cars.
It's clear that the victim, the woman at the age of 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including the truck.
She died in the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to the police, they have not all been identified yet. The police call on these drivers and all the others who have witnessed the accident to report themselves.
A criminal investigation was opened, “a logical step in a situation like this, said for Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofsteter.
It is still necessary to see if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent impact?
The prosecutor must find out,\" said Hofsteter.
On the basis of two similar cases from the past five years, drivers seem not to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was the person going on the highway - it was decided that motorists cannot expect a walker that passes through the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was removed from charges for death from negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on a highway A1 near Paynerne at night in August 2014.
In court, the victim at the age of 22 drank alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that a police officer - who responded to an emergency call - was driving in a reasonable way and that the presence of a man on the road was “a very exceptional and unpredictable situation,” said the judge.
Anyone with information about the fourth incident that occurred at Morges should log in to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
It's a tolerant city.
Prague is the popular LGBT community destination.
The association of Czech travel agencies and agencies (ACCKA) expects that there will be up to 20,000 visitors in Prague.
On Friday, the Executive Director of the AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková told me.
The sixth year Prague Pride began on August 8th, the festival approaches the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
“Praha is one of the most popular destinations in the LGBT community, namely for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises,” said Petříčková.
According to the survey of organizers, foreign visitors spend their festival on average every day 3100 crowns per person.
Gay tourists are available special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
“For travel in general, LGBT clientela is very lurking, is interested in staying in higher price relationships with high standard travel services and spends more than others,” Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year as part of the festival program.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues on Sunday, August 14th.
The main topic of this year is love, but events will also address several thematic areas that are family, prevention of AIDS and transgenic issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional guide with allegorical cars, which will go from Václavské náměstí to Letna.
This year, thousands of people participated in the lead, worshiping a minute of silence in the victims of the June attack in the night club in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrates 40 years.
Indecent cots Pat and Mat, whose efforts are usually caused by disaster, enjoy small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening's show of director Lubomír Benes was premiered on August 12, 1976.
For the creation of this animated series, who now know audiences in more than 100 countries of the world, were cartoon jokes by artist and director Lubomír Benes, who had been thinking for a magazine with two masters of Ouholík and Sedlec.
Benech then invited the dramaturgist Jiří Kubíčka and artist Vladimír Jiranka to cooperate and together created a film from the Kutciers.
Today's image with yellow and red trick and sleek and radioman got figures in 1979 when he started in Short Film Prague to create a series for Slovakia's TV.
On behalf of Pat and Mat were then made in 1985, this time it was shot directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990 he founded Lubomír Benech his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of them participated in Benech’s son Marek.
At present, there are over 90 episodes with stories of these cots, which they all get together under their hands, but they never get angry with each other and they are always filled with optimism, ideas, and cotilian enthusiasm, and finally they are satisfied with their work, which will make a known gesture--and it is--
Pat and Mat even moved from television to books, DVD and to theaters and characters or other toys with the image of Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy.
A story for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmon.
The end of the week is a fairy tale sign, we chose one sport and one of our lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what things do people spend most on airports?
That's the Friday overview of the world's websites.
First medal from Olympic Games.
Historical success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this olympic was defeated in the finale of the Olympic tournament of the seven-legged team of Great Britain.
It's the first medal ever made for Fija in the Olympics.
Waiting for the profits of the first valuable metal lasted 60 years from sending the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji is a great asset for success.
But it's irony that Brit Ben Ryan is him.
The team has been leading since 2013 and could have been satisfied by the British citizen after finale.
“Let’s play freely and easily and see if the greatest match in our history can be done,” said the coach before the finale.
In the end, the small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The French daily Le Monde brought the report.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without hands for 11 months and got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
“Mom, she is like me,” she counseled with a two-year-old girl, as her mother betrayed ABC News.
She added that her daughter liked to take off her hands and legs and then sit together without prostrate.
Harmonia has been diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year, doctors have given her only a 10-per cent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He's got a lot of insight.
I saw her showing up with other kids with words, I'm Harmonie, and I don't have my hands, she added her mother.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we spend most at the airport?
CNN brings a finding that people at the airports spend most on packed water.
The salesman Hudson's travel account published data in the last year, where it summarizes 10 products that customers buy most frequently in their business at airports.
Water was the first in the basement.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight were placed in the first ten.
Ninth place served large pack of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the first ten?
You can't eat as the only one of the above mentioned things.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The universe sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they laughed at Murray and Bond.
The ambassadors Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have been playing the category of doubles without the Koreans for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first sight, an unnatural pair went to a smaller crew after the Olympics in Beijing and since 2009 it has been competitive.
At the laguna Rodriguez de Freitase, 69th prize was added in the quarter final.
What are we different from the others?
We're just prettier, he's been joking about Murray during the Olympic Regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the Dominance of New Zealand twins.
Frankly, we do nothing different than others.
We're just training hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray more serious.
Their superpower is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-meter and a hundred-foot chasm, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, for example, Murray has a charity boxing match.
That's not why he spends too much time hanging around.
Eric's getting on the boat basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might happen, admit Bond, who, even at the press conference, has shown that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He's always responded first and Bond's waiting for his opportunity.
But on the water, they destroy their opponents with calm force.
They're driving their pace, and even though they're often in the middle of the line, they haven't found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're going to set up a two-wheel track, and we never wanted to take the first mile up.
We're just trying to go the pace that no one else can.
We know what we need to do to win, say four-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at World Cup.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a steering wheel.
Just after an unexpected failure, the larger crew on Beijing Olympics decided to move to a double without a steering agent a year later.
At the Olympics in London, apparently the greatest defeat of their careers has been made and the dominances have confirmed also in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be damn difficult, and we had to make sure we were mentally well on it, told Murray.
We know everyone wants to take us off the throne.
We still have that target on our back.
But we're trying to be a half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once a resident
According to the projection of the new climate model NASA was once inhabited by Venus.
Scientists at the Goddard NASA Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for examining Venus using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by scientists dealing with climate studies.
The model was designed to determine whether once in Venus, whose surface is hot, without water, and the simple CO2, could have ruled conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have already suggested that the low speed of turning Venus can be explained by its density by the atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be suffocating with a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and turned slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet were probably dryer than on Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical diversity to rule life on it and provide protection against rapid dispersion.
Venus used to use the sun earlier, which was 30 percent more brief.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venusz model, during a slow turn, it sets its daily side to the sun almost two months at once,” explained the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in the new report.
Thus there is a warming of the surface and the formation of rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds which are treated as umbrella and surface in front of an excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model has compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution that planetary scientists have previously established hypothetically.
Although Venus was probably in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans have been drained and water pairs have been burnt with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and left only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal effect of greenhouse gas -- that is Venus as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations team Colorado Avalanche, as a reason for his failure to participate in the decision-making process on team issues.
The effective vice president/general manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and said that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I worked as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” said Roy in his statement.
I've been thinking intensively over the years how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organisation.
It must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who received Roy May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He's led the team to gain 112 points and the first place in Central Division. Colorado has been dealing with Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and he's always had matches after the season.
Avalanche team in the season 2015/2016 reached score 39:39:4 and he missed five points to get the second wild card in the Western conference.
Roy's nephew, who signed up for the Hall of Glory, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil platform restore interviews and interrupt strike
In the North Sea, the leaders of the negotiating parties said that the strikers were interrupted because of the wages of oil platforms workers in the North Sea, while all parties to the dispute were held on a new round of negotiations.
The costs against the oil companies of the Wood Group came in sporadically to the platforms in the North Sea, which operate by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Wood Group and Trade Organisations of the Union and RMT may confirm that they have agreed to re-establish the process for dealing with current disadvantages,’ states the statement.
Starting next week, we'll have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we'll try to look at the problems from the new angles.
According to the trade union organisations, their recent actions, which they say were the first in over 25 years, to protest against wage cuts up to 30 percent.
Wood Group decreased its rates this year and paid about 9 percent less to its suppliers in the North Sea due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's rates comes after a 10-per cent reduction for the coastal company in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide space to cope with market decline.
On the other hand, Shell deleted thousands of people from his payment lists and announced plans to leave operations in the oil and natural gas field to 10 countries due to modernising his processes - immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a Member of the Scottish Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade leaders to discuss one of the greatest jobs in the context of the generation that led to stables in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as said, is vital to the economy in the region.
\"In the North Sea and across the country we need a economy that works for all, not only for some,\" he said.
For comparison, nearly 1.4 billion dollars are expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average for the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of turning stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get nearly a complete list of speed turning stars from the Pleiada star.
New data help astronomers understand why the stars in the starship are rolling at different speeds, as well as how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope to learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even history in its solar system,” said Luisa Rebullowová, a research worker in the center of Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiada Star is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching the state of adulthood and have been created over 125 million years.
Now it's turning fast.
In an eye, the maximum speed of turning these teen stars release a huge amount of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
With the star getting older, its rotation rate is slowing down.
Kepler measures the speed of turning every star so that it measures the time between discovering discernable points on stars -- similar to sunlight.
According to the latest data on the speeds of turning, bigger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
The rebels compare stars to dancers, they make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“We can see in “the ballet” that more slowly turning stars are more massive, while those who are turning fast are usually very light stars,” said Rebullová.
Because the Plejad starship is so close, it serves as an ideal space lab to compare the quality of stars and speed of turning.
“The plates provide a anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,” Rebullová said.
There is still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation speed and say, “it hangs up their dancing shoes on the nail”
Rebullow and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of turning Plejad in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement needed?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualifier agreement wouldn't be closed and after a few months, could I go to another hospital?
Is it possible for you to work without entering special education?
I'm concerned that in the field where I want to work, there's now a free job only in a slightly remote hospital, but about six months later, it could relax a place in another place where I'd like to work.
So I don't know how to solve the situation for about a half a year, but I'm going to ask you a question.
It's the Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospitals.
The qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between employees and employers in order to ensure the return of costs incurred by increasing or deepening the qualifications of the staff member.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being developed to avoid such agreements in order to ensure the working mobility of healthcare professionals and not all hospitals currently require that agreement.
According to Law No 5/2004 Coll., on the conditions of acquisition and recognition of professional competence and specialised competence for the exercise of the medical profession of a physician, dental physician and pharmacist, it is explicitly true that participation in specialization training is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not as an increase in qualifications).
This means that the qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Law if the costs amount to at least CZK 75 000.
No regulation or obligation to enter special education.
The Act only lays down the conditions for an application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to perform the profession of a physician already due to the training of the necessary higher education studies, even if under the conditions laid down under the law (in expert supervision of a physician with specialised competence in the relevant field).

According to the AFP, 15 out of 35 doctors, who operate in the eastern Halab, have already taken control of the rebels in the letter.

The world looks at and notes how difficult Syria is, but it does not do much to protect us.
Recent evacuation offers from the Syrian regime, and Russia sounds like only a slightly covered threat, the pedicators, surgeons, and other doctors.
