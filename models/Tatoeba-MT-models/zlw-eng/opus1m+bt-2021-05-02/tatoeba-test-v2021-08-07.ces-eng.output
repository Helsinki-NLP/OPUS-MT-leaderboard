According to the Taseby directives, it is recommended that they only add sentences in their native language or translate from a language that they understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier for you to read naturally-insensitive sentences in their native language. If we write in a language other than native, it is very easy to create the sentences that sound strangely. Please translate the sentence only if you know what it means.
