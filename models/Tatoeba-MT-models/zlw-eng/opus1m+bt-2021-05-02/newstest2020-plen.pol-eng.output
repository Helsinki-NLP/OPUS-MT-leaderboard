Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in the white age
He's a charismist.
The Holy Mass for the liberation and healing caused by him brings together the crowds.
He was several years old when things became unexplained in his life.
Today, through the Franciscans, others experience it.
The Holy Mass for the liberation and healing of the crowds are being removed by the O.V.
The parents of a 7-month child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart once came to him.
It was supposed to be operable.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
The boy was taken to the hospital on the same day.
The affected doctors said: “Operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm -
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual unusual action of the Creator has already begun to experience as a teenager.
In dreams, clean souls came to him with a request for help.
I was woke up at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at a given moment, he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of a bad spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body has begun to change.
I lost human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal - he says.
The invisible force carried him up, couldn't get his voice out of it.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“In the waters of the river that symbolizes holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form, ” he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
It matured the calling.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
He wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charistic Renewing Community in the Holy Spirit
In the Mass of Treatment by Father Witko, many people who count on getting rid of the disease are involved.
However, the clergy underlines that their main purpose is to heal spiritually rather than physical.
First failure Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26nd), the Kolping's FRAC team served with the current Polish champion Darto Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki within the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superligi Tenis Table.
Jarosławy in such a personal set that they presented with the grodzzans has a low chance to win with the sovereigns of the leagues.
He showed this to a good deal with Darto Bogora.
The team still lacks a team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps, in the composition of Jarosławian, they would have disappeared for the third time in a new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han probably hasn't grown up to win with fat like Grek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even one of the most promising Poles, which is Mark Bowowska.
Heldey was the largest single star in the MOSiR Hall at Sikorski street in Jarosławy.
Both in the old days with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three cases Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górk after an emotional five hundredth battle, Paul Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't get Lei's chance.
You could still have hoped for two more points, but Qiyao Han didn't go straight to Bowowsky.
There won't be additional studies for seniors.
Why?
According to the announcements by Rafal Trzyskowski, a free prevention program for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Taricification has not been approved.
In its justification, the Agency explained that the target group was ill-gooded.
\"More action can also result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to increasing the difficulty of accessing NFZ benefits and adversely affecting the patient by causing anxiety and discomfort related to false positive results of research.
The district council doesn't understand the president of the capital.
“Our money is ours, we have predicted it.
Only the government is afraid that if people study, then they'll go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it's about to lead to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know this helps when it comes to the health burden, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a proper approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, said Rafal Tzaskowski.
\"I find it difficult to imagine that the experts ran, \"Let's not study, because there will be longer tracks with a doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that there is a health service in this state,\" added PO policies.
Palestine is consistent with Israel: We will terminate all existing agreements.
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the United Nations General Assembly session that he would break any agreement concluded with Israel if the future government of the country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanjah's statement of an annex to the Palestinian earth.
“If the future Israel government, as it will come up, will proceed to the implementation of this plan, we will invalidate all the signed agreement (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments it has taken,” he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” he threatened with Abbas pressure.
\"It is our duty to defend all of our rights with all possible means: it is not important that the consequences of this will be fully involved in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism\", said President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanjahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, received a government reform mission after the elections of 17 September.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he had won, he would announce the addition of the Valley Jordan and intend to join Israel all the Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Ararat, signed a number of peace agreements that were supported by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised that the UN General Assembly would take place on the land of Palestinian universal elections.
Last took place in 2006.
\"After returning to the country, I call on the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem on the Eastern elections and all those who would object to them, they will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,\" said the Prime Minister of Palestine.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to exercise the powers of “a full member of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions,
The Palestinian leader concluded the speech by calling the international community to “must Israel fulfil all respect for the provisions of the United Nations.
The ambassador of Israel, Danny Danon, briefly responded to the Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader “will focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel, rather than fighting against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership.
However, Danon, as the agencies report, did not refer to the claims of the Palestinian lands occupied by Netanyjah.

PLN 105 million for companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to the gaming companies that create innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the 3rd edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, the development of a platform for the development of field games based on the AR engine, which creates a real world map with an application for data transfer by users; a test and training platform to verify practical skills for the work and professional improvement of the VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating the management of real-time production processes using the innovative model of gameplay based on the interaction of the virtual world with the use of industry 4.0, is presented in the NCBR communication sent on Friday PAP.
The objective of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game producers sector in the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1,85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 was 2,23 billion.
\"Secretably prepared research agenda GameINN and supporting PLN 300 million for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme represents an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev - we read the Communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
\"Incentives from the government to innovation entrepreneurs, such as B+R relief, skills improvement programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by the NCBRs, are fueling innovative business and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market: the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The Head of Science points out that innovation money not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets, with a relief for R & D in 2018. Three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited than a year earlier.
\"The amount of deducted R & D costs amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, giving over PLN 300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN - stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kameniecki points out that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous funding competitions with a total value of more than 211.2 million PLN.
The great interest of the III competition and the diversity of proposals shows that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“In particular, it is pleased that, as in previous editions, projects for solutions that are not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0 have been added.
In the third GameINN competition for funding up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs, business consortia and a consortium of enterprises with scientific units could apply.
87 applications for total funding of PLN 317 million have been received by the NBBR.
The budget of the competition at the time of the award of the contest was PLN 100 million, but was increased, so 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million of funding.
Details of the results of the III GameINN competition are available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Agreement of Polish Games, including companies such as CD Project, Technology, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who reached the end of August with Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch disappeared from the locker room.
Not what it's worth, because it's worth €700,000.
The mad Danas didn't show up in classes the next day, explaining their stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
Pillars in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, he finally confessed to the theft of Diaby-Fadig.
18-year-old already invited Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Viier.
He also promised Dana to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young generation footballers in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to debut for three years later on the first team.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper “L’Equipe” said, the club is likely to solve it immediately.
So far, he was in the process of disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that they must be washed (e.g. when they come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it in the right way.
It's especially important now that autumn infections are coming up.
At least 30-40 seconds to wash enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
But most of us wash them less!
Just hot water and just soap - it is not true that it must be antibacterial (a lot of doctors even advise them).
Having washed not only from the inside and the top of the hand, but also: the tip of the finger (connected or individually) - cut it with the hands of the goat, the spaces between your fingers (to pay your hands, to cut your fingers), thumbs, each thumb, we cover the other hand and put it in a moment to right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash your hands) we should wipe our hands with a wet hand, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 zł).
When using the public toilet, do not touch the washed handlebar or door (the recommendation of the Chief Sanitar Inspector).
Open it by paper towel.
President Iran says he rejected the offer of talks with the US, Donald Trump denys
Teheran did not hold talks with the American party during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer made by the Americans to abolish sanctions, said President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
The U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was an Iranian party who asked for the removal of restrictions that he did not agree to.
According to the President of Iran, Hasan Rowhani, Americans proposed the abolition of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would have to regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic missile construction programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not hold talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
President Iran concluded that he did not agree to take these discussions because of the ‘toxic atmosphere’
He testified that he met with American diplomats because he was the head of France, Germany and the UK.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not hold talks in the atmosphere of “maximum pressure”
“And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the final result will be,” said Rowhani.
The day before, the Irish leader said that he did not rule out the talks with the US and the European parties to the nuclear agreement rejected the promotion of American sanctions in Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the US’s entry into force of the nuclear agreement “is a preliminary condition that does not allow dialogue to be established.
If we can handle this initial condition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, we can, of course, talk to America - declared.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with the US president Donald Trump, although he did not agree to this conversation during the UN General Assembly last week.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no.
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian party's request.
“Iran wanted me to endure the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said, \"No,\" said the President of the United States.
The voltage with the atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to mitigate the tension between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which was signatories.
It considered that, in exchange for the abolition of the economic sanctions, Iran would resign from the nuclear weapon construction programme and the nuclear sector will be controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they wish to maintain an agreement in force.
None of this has happened yet.
Washington uses maximum pressure tactics on Iran, and sanctions also cover full embargo on Iran's oil.
Tehran announced that if it did not receive an export permit for raw material, it would limit its obligations every 60 days, resulting from the agreement.

Judge of the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the flock of Emilia, who, according to her words and screenings from WhatsApp, participated in the stalker to the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday to rule by the NSA.
reason: there has been no disciplinary proceedings for him, and therefore there is no grounds for maintaining the board of President Wojciech Mazura to withdraw it from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, disciplinary spokesperson at the NSA, began an investigation procedure at the end of August to Šmydt, but it has not been converted until now in the proceedings against him.
Although the NSA, acting in such cases as a disciplinary court, must take the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its issue.
In this situation, a judge who publicly talks about the mental problems of his wife to discredit her, who, due to suspicion of participation in the group of the flocks, was removed from the KRS office, will return to the judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt contradicts her participation in the group of the captains.
He says there's no evidence of any more falsified screens and his wife's words that he's divorced from.
That is exactly what the other judges claim to be connected to “the Father,” all are innocent, and there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll be standing on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't feed her finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, she also kept her phone content in June on another case.
The police didn't stick their fingers in order to secure the devices of those who were persecuted by Judge Waldemar Żurek from February.
There is no evidence: there is no problem with Šmydta, there is no case \"Kasty,\"
And there's no case with the chief of NI Marian Banasia about renting the stones to the basements and hiding the income.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And she'll check when she checks.
You will not take care of Banassim's ethics committee because Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered up to make a serious decision to cancel the Banasia alternates and to appoint as his lawyer, although the law does not foresee such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a new movie, American mistake, about how my wife goes home and stops her husband with his lover in bed.
She's so upset and crushed that she can't make a word.
She's standing in the door, and at that time, her lover's getting out of bed fast, dressed and out.
And the husband went off the bed.
When my wife returns voice and screams, what is this?
Who is this woman?
My husband's still asking: what woman, honey?
Only that in the case of “Kasty, whether Banasia is the parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final of the jump
The early return this season to rivalry after the Mother's break, the brown medalist of the world championship from London 2017, first tried to beat 1,85 and 1,89 and in the second 1,92.
1,94 was only able to get it in the third approach.
“I’m glad.
I showed you that I can fight because the first attempt was completely missed.
In the finals, I will have to have a better technical jump - she admitted to the Eurosportu Lićwinko camera.
In the eliminations the best were the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karyna Demidik, after 1,94.

Kornel Morawiecka is in a hospital in severe condition
He hit the hospital, and his doctors call him heavy.
He's conscious and conscious.
\"We believe it will come out that he will win again.
We are all praying to return to health - to give an anonymous close person to Kornela Morawiecki in speaking with journalists “Super Express”
In the coming elections, the father is running for Senat.
“In my life, I am held by the nearest family and politics,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview, which he told journalists “Super Express” two weeks ago,
In January, “Super Express” announced that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to research at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and reported to the hospital.
It turns out I have a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a computer scan was conducted, it was said that I had a pancreatic cancer, and my father gave the prime minister.
A few days later, at the MSWAA Hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki was undergoing serious surgery.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal band priest Zbigniew Krasa to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know that many people prayed for me for what I thank you very much for.
Lucky for me, I don't seem to be out of the game.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I give myself to doctors of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to get back to some state of use.
I hope it will be all right,\" said Kornel Morawiecki in January in his talk with “SE”
“If I were too late to study, the situation would be tragic and that I would have heard about it already,” he added.

The power of the olive jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports contests, played Sunday afternoon on September 15 on hypodromes on Oleandry Street in Olava, can be for some misguided.
For the true power of the way is far away, but such a mine is determined by one of the kinds of constant competition...
The competition of the power of jumps is to beat by the rider and horse more and more obstacles that in the most prestigious international professions exceed even two metres.
It is worth to add that the long-term and still unbroken record of the world, established in 1949, by Chilijczyk Alberta Larraguibel, on the horse “Huaso” is 247 cm.
So high in Oław, of course, no one has jumped, but the result of the best local amazement at 135 cm is also not the worst....
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle, they represented a showable part of the previously played “Tutch riding contests - about which we write more about this number of newspapers, on page 22.
There were eight amazons who were trained to compete with the JKS.
Four of them competed on corn, four on large horses.
In the first group, Nikola Sclerra, who was the crazy “Sprinterer”, was the best one.
This little, but how dynamic rumak began to overcome the obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and it ended only at the station with a upper beam separated from the ground by 125 cm.
However, it was easy to give up, and only after three further refusals, the jury was pushed away from further competition.
The second place in the ponie jumps took place by Amelia Pawlak, who received “Fama, and the third place Lena Borun on “Harmidera”
Ambly fought the youngest event of the tournament - Inga Aksman, a galloping and jumping through obstacles to the little glare “Carmen”-
Even greater emotions were accompanied by starting amazons and viewers during the competition with large horses.
Paul’s Szewczyk, a “declaration” and Abramenko’s Anastasia, who went to “Lotce”, counted a growing fall.
Fortunately, aside from the small arches or the amazons, nothing bad happened to horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mares “Winet” on the park, which was accompanied by the Veronika Łukačewicz.
It needed either an asysta trainer or another horse to the couple behind which a little crazy “Winet” fell behind.
After including obstacles from the park, she also had a full stroke, so the moments in the box and the stressers were dangerous. “All are under control,” Jan Siekiewicz calmed down a little bit of this scared viewer, especially the youngest.
Since the beginning of the big horse competition, Martha Masalska has been doing well in the park, having a beautiful presentation “Whisky”
This handsome button, in pairs with an experienced amazone, followed by the second approach in the final phase, was the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result at this point.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also counted the same height on the declaration “Veronik Łukkyewicz” on “Winecie” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Lotce”
So all these players, together with the amazons on the slopes in the town of Radecki, have done a successful honorary round, ending with these interesting and exciting competitions.

Max Colonko is cut off from the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which political formation #R Revolution Mary Max Colony was to go to October's parliamentary elections.
The revolution led its proposal especially to young voters on the right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolko announced working with Mark Jakubiak, or Pawl Kukiz, but none of these coalitions came into existence, and KWW's Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko even managed to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed on Twitter that he finished working with KW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
I'll expect my name to be deleted from the KWW.
I would like to ask you not to join my person in/in the subject in question - he added and announced that more information would be given soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue to act if it is the end of the formation of the #R Revolution.
On July 4, in the U.S. day of independence, the journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko informed about the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has been famous for his work on YouTube channel Max TV, on which he comments events in Poland and in the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
The party’s programme included issues relating to the judiciary (which should be chosen in the universal elections), tax changes (comparation of tax free for all), military separation (in the form of military assistance to the eastern state of NATO, with particular regard to Poland), the conduct of a referendum on arms possession, the restriction of the number of Members or the introduction of single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his profile in social media suggesting that #R will combine forces with Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions finally happened.
UBS: Golden close to the balance point
“The Euro Curs will remain in the vicinity of the 4,35 zł ceiling in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak continuance on global markets,” says Michael Bollier, UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations of maintaining a sound pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy speak for the stabilising of the gold quotations on the current ceiling - assesses a specialist in the talks with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its feet in an environment where a vast majority of central banks will mitigate policy.
“If gold is properly valued, the euro quotations should remain in the vicinity of the 4,35 zł in the coming months, the Polish bonds are less attractive.
Michael Bollier, head of asset allocation to UBS Wealth Management markets, is much more favourable than Polish securities.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world's horsepower.
\"Global slowness may be further deepened, but there should be no severe recession, and as far as possible, GDP dynamics will go slightly below zero,\" says Michael Bollier.
“Investors should not weigh global shares that may harm the lack of prospects for the solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trumpa impeachment procedure and the rexit.
Among the equity markets, Europe should be the least vulnerable, as it is from the latest letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
“The euro area countries should act worse than US because they are more vulnerable in terms of increased uncertainty around global trade and concern against slowdown, we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets, the most secure countries have pushed the profitability of the German 10-years even to minus 0,74%, it is still possible to deepen their profitability.
However, in the longer term, long-term viability should no longer fall, but only short-term, with the mitigation of bank monetary policy.
The biggest field to cut feet is Fed, which should lead to the weakening of the American currency in the horizon for further years.
The long-term balance point for the euro quotations is the ceiling of 1.29 USD, which would mean the 19 % potential of strengthening the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed's feet, which will result in reducing differences in monetary policy in the world.
\"To maintain the dollar's strength in a long time, they may not allow deficits in the current and budgetary account\" says Michael Bollier.
Bundeswehra's got a gun.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra noted the disappearance of 39 pieces of weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19 445 ammunition, resulting from a confidential summary of the protection of RFN.
The information provided a press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (NDD).
According to a document from the Parliamentary State Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two pieces of weapons have been reassessed, one part of the weapons and 3474 pieces of ammunition.
Among the military equipment that remains missing, there are among others: six universal MG3 machine rifles, 11 automatic rifles G3, four automatic G36 rifles, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
In addition, there is no 30 lux to MG3 machine guns.
The rapporteur, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As the RND said to the journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “containing, ”
More importantly, only a small part of the lost equipment has been found as a result of the investigation.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these activities as ‘extreme balance sheet’
She also criticised the fact that it was not possible to establish whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence against the security of the state and violation of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer has been ordered to prepare attacks on the leading German politicians from the extremes of the right and racist motives.
In his “black list, the goals that occurred in the hands of the prosecutors were found, among others, the former Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Aneta Kahane, the human rights defender and the founder of the Amadeau Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally in possession of four pieces of firearms, more than 1000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
The crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for those for whom travelling in a crying child society is a nightmare.
Through the website of the line, the website allows you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If a combination travels to a second year of age, “the child’s icon appears on a specific, reserved by parents or carers.
Thus, the person using the service of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place remote from that taken by the painter.
The BBC states that the lines have already informed about the imperfection of this solution.
‘The role of the child will not occur when the ticket has been reserved by a third person or if there has been a change in the aircraft at the last minute.
As expected, the idea was shared by the interns.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by means of noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be kids.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need maps of places sitting for breathing lips, spitting or drunks,” wrote G Sundar.
Another one of the interns noticed that they once bothered him with crying kids on a plane, but he changed his mind when he was a parent.
Nor does it lack the supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me about screaming children during a 13 - hour journey, ” wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major has a loss after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for vacation on Majorka as a result declared Monday by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
As announced on Friday, the representative of the Autonomous Government of Marc Ponts, among 25 thousand holidayers who will not be able to take a October leave on Majorka, are also those who were to travel with Thomas Cook, i.e. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidayers, who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company, had to give up their holiday at Majorce next month, constitute German citizens and Scandinavian states.
However, as Pont says, since Thomas Cook did not drive tourists to the balearian island in November, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He stated that the Baleary Government had already launched negotiations with international operators on “the entry into the Majorka market - after the British operator’s bankruptcy.
According to the estimates of the newspaper “Diario de Mallorca, in October, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs because of the tourist crisis in Majorce.
About 800 are the workers of Thomas Cook's office in Palmie.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many major hotel owners requested additional accommodation fees from the guest.
This situation has experienced, among others, dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Baleary Government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorce have been operating at least until the end of October in connection with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and its cooperating company.
On the other hand, the Friday newspaper “Diario de Ibiza” indicates that most of the hotels working in Ibizie, which cooperated with Thomas Cook, are not intended to close the facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this ballet island, the British banker was working with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Baleary authorities announced that they would return to the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover losses caused by the announcement by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They revealed that the most affected on this tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, was in Majorka.
According to the Baleary Government data, Thomas Cook is following local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of the agreements concerning the July-September 2019 period, about EUR 5 million.

‘Rz’: Smog caught the government
“The effects of the Clean Air” programme are small, and coal furnaces will dig this winter as if never anything“ we read on the first page of today’s “Rzeczpopolite.”
“To date, under the Clean Air Programme, 82 000 applications for funding amounting to PLN 2 billion, of which 44,000 were positive.
The accepted applications provide a total of more than PLN 915 million, indicating the ‘Rz’ by referring to data from the Minister of the Environment.
As indicated in the paper, only part of the costs incurred are refunded from the programme.
The results announced by the noise of the journal program are assessed as ‘scromne’
The self-governments quoted by the “Rz” are looking at failures of the Clean Air, among others, in too much bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, delivery of invoices by post, possible sampling of implementation.
This would improve the action - considers Mayor of Warminski Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smogic Alarm note that less than 1% of the target of 3 million anchors was implemented in the first year of action.
Although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
\"In the national budget of the Environment and Water Management Fund for this year, 1.4 billion PLN have been reserved for the year - we read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Blászczak: Now negotiating prices
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
“This is one of the last steps before the contract was concluded, but it is not the end of our work,” Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” added the Polish minister.
Agreement on Polish F-35
Polish air forces have a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the Polish Department of State gave their consent to their sales.
The Communication emphasises that investment will support national security and foreign policy in the United States by improving the security of NATO allies, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is to pay $65 billion for the fighter.
However, this is not a final price.
The State Department has indicated that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and corrective parts, training equipment, the implementation of engineering, logistics and personnel services and the related elements of support for logistics and programme and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II cylinder produced by Lockheed Martin is a single and single-engine multi-channel fifth generation.
The aircraft is able to carry out the mission of close support, bombings and typically hunting tasks of the air battle.
Thanks to the use of stalth, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
A long time ago, the F-35 hunter bought Belgium under a contract worth $4.5 billion.
Belgawa wants to replace them with an ageing F-16.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also to consider the purchase of American combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypepom.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie introduced a series of neutral sex dolls on the market.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Producer Barbie introduced a series of neutral sex dolls on the market
Next to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced neutral dolls to sell.
Toys from the \"Creable World\" series carry wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the dark, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
Also, the emphasis on gender characteristics was given - gender dolls have no longer full mouth, long eyelashes, or, in Ken’s case, wide arms.
The company believes that children don't like when their dolls have sex standards imposed, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made with a view to specific sex inhibit the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” says Mattel.
Barbie’s doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and shoes on a high village, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “non-healthy women stereotypes, such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
Koncern has responded to criticism and has already put dolls on the market with different colours of skin, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in hijab.
Zandberg: wheel or club Together can have a dozen Members
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio , and how many candidates of his party can get to Sejm from the left group list (KW SLD from which the candidates start their list to Sejm SLD, Wiosny and Lewis Together, starting with the common logo “Lewica”, replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
\"I believe that the outcome of the Lewis will be very good, because we feel that people have a binding hope that Lewis is not only right anymore, but he has the strength, too, he has.
According to Zandberg, it is clear that the leftman may have 60 to 80 Members.
“This may mean that the wheel or club together will have a dozen Members.
But that depends on Polek and Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's going to happen, he said.
Asked whether Lewis together will have a separate wheel, Zandberg said: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not succeed that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity of Poles has been rewarded because we have shown that, by different means, we have been able to reach out to the common program.
Questions whether the largest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Włodzimierna Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he felt that its largest beneficiaries were central and left-handed.
In turn, he pointed out that the SLD would receive the whole subsidy, he said that “the purpose of the political party is to represent its voters,” he said.
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to Sejm.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates to which my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further,” he said.
“I speak very honestly and clearly that if I had been in District 44, I would have taken the election certificate and voted in another district,” he stressed politicians.
\"I wouldn't try to give my voice to Minister KO-AP\", he added.
In this district outside Ujezdowski, the leaders of RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: Open the largest match in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by buses, cars and pedestrians to Bopp district, where there were new matches that could accommodate 30,000 faithful.
The facility was built by the Moride Bractwo, belonging to the Sufisky Nurtu Islam, which dominates in Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, transferred by the government.
The name of the town of Massalikul Jinn (‘Treats to Paradise’ is derived from the title of the poem of Sheikka Ahmedo Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, quoted by the followers as saints.
The furniture is lined with the Carrarian marble and has five mints.
The highest of them is 78 meters away.
It's 15 grand in the middle, and the other one can be on an external espanda.
In richly finished interiors, you can admire the golded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in Western Africa, but there is no comparison to the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II Match in Casablance can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than €30 million, has been financed by private donations.
In addition to the ground, the government, however, funded lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road work worth EUR 10.5 million.

Their fall to the wall after the last whistle did not result from a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close,” said Smyal.
As he said, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will teach the team to play in the side sectors of the field.

These trees can completely disappear from Europe
‘42% of the species of trees belonging to the tree state of Europe are at risk - warns the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) in its published Friday ‘The Red Paper of European Trees -
On the top of the leaves are e.g. chestnuts and hawks.
IUCN, an organisation established in Gland in Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by specialists who, on the basis of research, concluded that among 454 species of trees present in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% are ‘highly threatened’.
Among the reasons for the Red Paper, urban aglomerations and global climate change are rapidly expanding.
However, the most vulnerable trees and bushes, which occur only or mainly on our continent.
As regards the typical European tree, 58% of the species are at risk by IUCN professionals, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and bushes, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the operation of woodland, accelerated urbanisation, too intense tree extermination, and in the subsequent order of forest fires and changes occurring in the European ecostystemia.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of bushes, moss and growth is also seriously threatened.
\"The progress of human activities leads to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and creates a danger in Europe of the destruction of important and underestimated varieties which form the basis for European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet - the summary of the Luc Bas report, which runs the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetine: I won't promise 600+
“Today, PiS wants to buy Poles, offering them for their freedom of disbursement for credit, which will have to pay future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyn in an interview for the “Rzeczpospolite”
In his view, “the whole piS policy is a pic--
At the same time, the policy promises that \"what is given will not be taken\"
Schetin provides in a conversation with Jackie Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea of defeating the Law and Justice.
It's about the mobilisation of the electorate in electoral grains.
In his view, the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Kaczyński party.
“Today, people who want to live in a normal country are more than PiS followers, a party that has overtaken the praised values, such as modesty, humility, transparency, says Schetin.
The Leader of the Civil Coalition and Chairman of the Civil Platform also identified the basic establishment of the KO electoral programme.
\"First of all, nothing will be taken, but it is necessary to set a forward direction for the future, because the PiS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen at least after dramaticly low investments,\" he said.
Secondly, it concerns “the movement of energy of Poles, aid and investment in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurs -
Schetin explains that the KO programme includes a project that will give more than 614 gold to the most earning Poles, and more earners, even after a few hundred.
The Politician also stated that he didn't want to go after the divorce.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
“I will never allow for a Greek option, where the governing authorities have opted for a disparity, until finally the country’s financial collapse has fallen,” he stressed.
Schetin in the interview for “Rz” also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiec are afraid to debate with him and Mr Kidawa-Blonski.
“We would make them hypocritical and propaganda,” he said.
“The pride goes before the fall.
Kaczyński is the man of state, as Bansz is crystal, added.
He also said that he had not decided yet to apply for the Platform's leadership.
Argentina: Six dead big condors
Six large condors were found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.
Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Great condors were probably poisoned by a means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes and wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten toxic padlin.
Except for one young person, the rest of the dead condors were grown.
“It is a great loss to the environment, because the Condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertility and capable of reproduction.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species, says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine Environment Organisation.
“I think that the use of toxic baits and poison affects not only this species in danger, but all other forms of life, including human health, adds.
‘Rz’: They want a jewel for the President
They've moved on to grant your head a precious chain.
The idea is supported by Andrzej Dudy’s chancellery - read “Rzeczpospolite”
As the newspaper explains, this is about the gold chain of the White Eagle, the Royal Insegnium officially called during the interwar jewel of the Republic.
The last time he used it was probably President Ignacy Mościticki.
“The rz says that soon such a chain can be found on Andrzej Dudy’s shoulders.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the rule of law and Petitions announced on Wednesday the proposal for a new law on orders and designation to bring it back.
The Log says it's not the first attempt to restore that chain of state's head.
Since 1992, the Senate has proposed this amendment, but it has gone through one voice.
This time, the work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted the matter to a few minutes, recognising that the President's opinion was reached.
This one came in mid-September.
“I am pleased to note that the Chancellor of the President of the Republic of Poland did not comment on the position presented in this petition,” said Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee continued the case and re-secrated the matter for little time.
“The President’s office replied briefly: it is for us to restore this,” said Chief of Committee Robert Mamątow of PiS, quoted by “Rz”
He proposed that the legislative work be taken, which the committee supported.
The cops will teach drivers how to drive across the crossroads
The police action will be carried out, among others, at the crossroads of the Ceplinski of Al. Piłsudski.
The uniform action is similar to the recent complaints by the city authorities on drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the crossroads.
On Friday, September 27th, policemen begin at the Reich of Preventive Action “The Crossroads of the Crossover”
This is about removing traffic obstacles: driving on a crossroad without the possibility of a convention, not to comply with traffic signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and in fact we are making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrabiński, the vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words faded at the press conference of the city hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inadequate vehicle movement after crossings, which in effect creates traffic.
Meanwhile, the President appealed to the travellers of reasoning on the road and, among others, faster moving on the lights or not to write texts during the driving.
The theme of the Roman police took over, starting today’s action “The Crossroads, ”
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting the passways at the crossings of drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.
This is a frequent offense that contributes to the power of traffic obstacles and the formation of traffic jams.
It is threatened by a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 by criminal points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signals or road signs and to the wrong parking in the crossroad area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity, late moving from signals, free crossings and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
What crossings will be carried out?
M., among others, at Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellonska Street; al. Ceplinský z al. Piłsudskiego; Targowa Street of Pilsudski; Streniawów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or the Hetmanska Street of Warsaw.
This type of shares in Podkarpacia capital will be held on Fridays of October.

Vitala Heynen's underserved trip to the performance closed Thursday failure with the Slovenians 1:3 in Lublin.
It was about their troubles with traveling to this duel.
This time it was without such problems, on Friday afternoon they went along with the Slovenian charterers to Paris, and a few hours later they had practiced in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the relationships of those present in classes, the world champion training team was under-staffed.
As the assistant of Heynen Mikł Míszko Gogol, this time the main task was not the exercise of the retina elements itself.
\"We went to the hall, but in a determined majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending it more together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild all of this as a team, and apply.
He confirmed that semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both players and training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two sentences, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to this game.
We discussed this game between ourselves in the play, the coach talked a lot to the players.
As two main causes of failure, I would point out ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with saturical balls.
Slovenians were much better than us in this regard - he analysed.
In his view, “The White-Czerwed One did not stop stress associated with the show against the loud and numerous audience of the tournament’s partners.
He admitted that world champions could have put a little bit of a smooth way to the semifinals.
“It may be that, in the group phase, we may have a failure in a similar style, it would be faster for us to examine this lesson and later we would have played in the next phase of the tournament.
But it's just a time-out, he reserved.
Gogol hopes that the fourth failure of Poles will be aggression in a brown game.
“I hope that we will then show our true face.
There's something to fight about.
Recently, we fought the ME medal in 2011 - recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
During the group phase, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and went to Apeldoorn for the first two group sessions and moved to Lublin on a semifinal.
Nick Kyrgios: raw penalty but suspension
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on start and fine of $25,000 - in half-year suspension - for naked words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists lose their patience with Kygiosa, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of performances of the most uncircumcised professional trainers in recent years seems to be a grave - 16 weeks break plus a fine dispute, but both penalties are suspended for six months - a period where a bloodthirsty sportsman can improve.
Nick Kygios is only 24 years old, but he's been breaking up for a long time and making his own tennis record of the world - he has to pay the highest in his history of discipline for the single financial penalty for breaking the rules of the traffic and next to him.
Deep curses, strange gestures, unsportable behavior, insulting the judge and viewers, breaking two rockets in a lost match with Karen Chacznow - for this all after the ATP Masters 1000 August tournament in Cincinnati paid $1130,000.
In the US Open 2019 he also did not play long, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists “they are corrupt,” which hurt the organisation’s authorities so much that they implemented disciplinary investigations against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they submitted this verdict on the suspension of startes and subsequent fines.
However, the words of corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of expression.
However, the reasons given to the tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgosa’s behaviour for the whole 12 months in many cases was a serious concern and was almost continuous violation of the rules, that it was insulted by the turbulent persons associated with tournaments and viewers, hence a high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to bring an appeal and immediately delayed the execution of the judgment, ordering him to fulfil several conditions within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, he can no longer interfere with the rules of the Code of Conduct of existing professional tennis players, in particular he can not curse any more, destroy rockets, fight judges and audiences, or any other way of acting unwittingly and vulgarly.
He also recommended that he be looking for “hard support, from mental trainers during the tournaments and outside the season he also consulted with people specialising in solving the problems of athletes who are not able to behave properly.
The first comment (in social media) by Nick Kygiosa to the verdict was this: “Hey, all of you, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all--
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, since he had a bar injury in the Cup of Lavera, so he had to resign from the nearest start in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
ATP Kyrggios ranking takes place 27th.
This year he won two tournaments, in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he'll be very much left.
GUS: Poland is getting better and better
The report published on Friday by the GUS on household budgets shows that, as a good or rather good material situation, the material situation was assessed by up to 44% of them.
This percentage was 37.2% earlier, in 2016 33.5% and since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the household situation, it never exceeded 30%.
In total, 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households working on their own is the best.
More than 70% of respondents consider it to be good or rather good in this group.
On the second pole there are Renaissance households, where the proportion of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is the parents of a single parent who raises offspring, of whom the good or rather good material situation is declared 32%.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, and among childless households is 48.8%.
In these statistics, the 500+ programme effect is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by parents who were born alone to raise offspring and multi - child families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflect the rapid increase in income, especially from work.
However, this is not all because the proportion of households who consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of the province there is no clear relationship between the income level and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are the inhabitants of the Opole Region, where they consider their situation to be good or rather good for 48.9% of the surveyed.
There are also Lubuskie provinces (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowiecki (47.3%) and West Pomeranian (47.1%).
In Poland, however, the management income (i.e. after tax and contributions) was not more than 94% national average and 98% in Lublin.
The highest income was for Mazowiecki (120% national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average, in Poland, the management income per person was PLN 1693.
In real terms (after a price change adjustment) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
In the background of the previous years, it's a pretty low score.
In 2016, the income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
While the increase in income is slowing down, spending is also hampered.
Those per person in the ub.r.1187 zł, which means that in real terms they were reduced by 0.7%.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms and in 2016 by 4.3%.
The research of household budgets suggests that the statistical household is currently spending 70.1% of its management income, while it was more than 80% in 2014, and up to 90% by 2006.

USA: Three suicides among flight crews
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board the USS George H. W. Bush ship - informed the American Navy.
In total, five crew members of this ship have been killed over the last two years.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
As CNN says, all three sailors were shot last week.
Every event occurred on the land when USS George H. W. Bush knocked on the coast of Virginia.
The participation of third parties has been excluded so far.
Moreover, death is not to be associated with one another.
“The need for everyone to become involved in the presentation of suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent further suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no turbulentity or any other reperitation related to the search for assistance,\" wrote Captain Sean Bailey on Facebook, the commander of the ship.
The Niesielowski critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In his conversation with Piotr Licešecki Stefan Niesiálowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“All his views were accepted,” he said.
Later, there were criticisms of some of his actions.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Ryszyk, putting a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptoryist, a pestel of the Church and Poland, has developed his media in the best yet for the life of Pope Polak, has translated.
The former PO politicians admitted: “The dead were unhappy, the pope said something, once Ryzzyk did not accept, but he had power and politics could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, like his successor, explained Niesielowski.
\"This is why this fatal matter of pedophilia and the activities of the Church has come to an end and, in fact, their lack.
I ran a little forward thinking, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole life of his life.
We know about the scale of pedophilia in the Church from relatively recent.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things, says in a conversation with the Niesielowski journalist.
In the evaluation of the former PO policy, the Church is an ally PiS.
“It is important to admit that during the Solidarity period, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Mass of the Holy Mass, where the cross was hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, becoming a symbol of dictatorship, a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Ryzik are shaking the Polish Church that John Paul II has not done anything in this matter and that today the Church is an ally PiS.
It is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will come to pay for it - he convinced Niesielowski.
“I hope that Pope Francis will catch up with the Jędraszewski, Ryzzyk and some of the others, he has summarized.

Disqualified game
Older as part of the Polish Cup between Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk, a small hair did not end tragically, when an opposite team of Zlatana Alomerovicia passed by the Wejherów fans of Wejherov.
After this incident the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
This case, the PZPN commission, has directed the Gryph with a severe penalty, excluding it from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the 2020/2021 Polish Cup.
In addition, the toilets will not be released in the nearest match for their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to league games until December 31st.
Burdy in the stadium Widzewa Łódź also produced the fans of Silesia Wrocław.
However, this is where PZPN was milder because Śląsk provided that similar events could occur and taught the relevant authorities on this issue.
In spite of this, the services have allowed the boating sector to be abandoned by the roles, the burning of chairs and forsakes of the economy.
The game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use water cannons.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organisation of trips to matches in this and another PM.
The ban on departures also included league matches of the Extraclass, but it will take until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange labelling on the whole managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the new regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the recording of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Poland.
For example, “Lwów” appears next to “L’viv”
In our province of changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it should be easier, more easy and easier.
The new guidelines stem from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the village in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to our change in law, they will finally appear on the road road road road road roadsides.
The introduction of the new marking starts with the subcarpackic section of the A4 motorway, which was informed by the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
On Podkarpacie changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand zł.
First, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
How is the idea supposed to be implemented?
It'll be left without the exchange of tables, basically stickers.
They will currently replace the names of new localities written in Polish on the already existing characters.
Both names will be written in one line, first in Polish, and then in original, in brackets.
This will make it very easy for people who do not know foreign names of cities in the language of the country where they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windmill.
In a pond in Zamek, in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan having problems with wings.
After the founding and the visit of the vet, it turned out that someone had arranged a purpose with an animal, in his body a winder was found.
“The information about the injured bird has been received from the inhabitants of the village of the Rehabilitation Centre of Wild Animals in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We went somewhere.
It was clear immediately that something was very wrong with him.
We acted fast and precisely not to hurt him and not to compromise his additional stress.
The boat was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first photograph of the RTG, it was already known that someone made a shooting shield out of it.
In his body were fractures of the spruce, said Marcin Walesek, the president of the company Malpol managing, among others, the centre of rehabilitation.
I'm dying in the resort.
“The baths have been cleaned, the bird is given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the centre where it will spend all winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly yet.
It would now be associated with the fact that we would probably not have survived the winter, adding Walasek.
The staff after the rehabilitation swaning intends to release him in spring to the same joint.
After receiving information about the animal's ill health, the Gmina authorities intend to inform the prosecutor about the matter.
The event occurred in Zaměnia
Gowin: “We must stimulate Polish, minor trade -
“The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to wonder if the country has any tools to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister of Science and Higher Education, Head of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin, during the conversation in the “day signals”, said in Radio Only, that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that properly Polish companies cannot develop.
Given that this problem was very difficult to fight, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded us that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of his term of office, but he received “the contrague from the EC -
\"We have won justice before the court, and I hope that if the united rightman wins the nearest elections and formalizes the government, we will return to that,\" he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that “the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Poland, so small trade,
“In this case, we will need to consider whether the government has instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Gowin.
In May, the EU court considered that the European Commission had made a mistake considering that the Polish retail tax is an unacceptable public aid.
The retail tax Act assumed the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% from the income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% from the income over PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply since September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated infringement proceedings by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the tax construction could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It subsequently considered that the tax was implemented in a way incompatible with the law.
It also issued a order to suspend the application of the tax until it was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May Decision of the EU Court opened the way for tax reintroduction but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal in the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSEU provided PAP that the case is currently in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether or not and when the oral procedure is moving, the hearing of the parties and the possible trial.
The need for a good few to a dozen months after the appeal has been lodged.
\"This is the average year,\" said the PAP source in the Court of Luxembourg.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We're following a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of a baby and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity around the child to focus on the whole family together celebrating its appearance in the world.
No wonder, therefore, that a freshly sealed mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on that day.
But before you make the final decision about your baby's outfit, think about whether or not it will be convenient.
In stores you can find many machine kits that do not provide a small comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The primary criterion for choosing a dress for baptism is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks of little ones were baptized, dressed in white sets and inserted into the same barrels or big pillows.
Today, children coming to the sacrament are often older: several months, one year, and even bigger.
It's hard to think that such a great comfort needs a different dress for baptism.
So if your child’s day of baptism is three to four months old, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or the baptismal ones.
The best way to do this is to make him fit in comfortable, cotton comas or kits.
Although this element of the dressing is considered a daily outfit, it is sufficient to search for its sacred options, for example with a wave bank or a lace.
It's perfect for a boy to see points with a print of shell and glass.
In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in your dress.
Girl's gonna look pretty in a nice, fat dress.
Many parents look forward to richly decorated, counterfeiting dresses for baptism with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers are using artificial materials that do not breathe in which the child is simply inconvenient.
In search of a suitable dress, it will be better to look at Asanti for Kids shop, which offers elegant clothes on cotton linings.
Delicate, white skirts, satin dresses, laces, applications and lovely kits will make your daughter look nice and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for small gentleman: cotton suits
Until recently, among the parents, there was a fashion on suits that bought “old models.
Polyester jackets and pants, rigid collars or helmets often made young elegance loudly demonstrate their dissatisfiedness.
Fortunately, today they were supported by comfortable cotton kits.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, silver shorts, and to that sweatshirt decorated in front of the vest pattern.
These machines look extremely sacred, and at the same time they do not twist movements of the world of little people.
Krystyna Pawlovič published a property statement
Krystyna Pawlovič made a property statement at the end of her term.
It follows that Mr PiS gathered PLN 110 thousand of savings.
Let's remind you, Pawlovak announced leaving politics.

According to the statement made by the Member, it shall take a monthly pension of 4,7 thousand PLN.
Pawlovak has an apartment of 570 thousand zł and a slightly smaller one that rents, receiving 880 zł per month.
It also invests in industrial metals, evaluating investment in PLN 150 000.
Before that, Jarosław Kaczyński also published his property statement.
Voting on the break-up of the Conservative Party conference
The British parliamentarians voted against the three-day break in the Chamber of Gmin at the annual conference of the Conservative Party, which the government asked for.
289, v. 306.
The House of Gmin does not normally hold part-session meetings, so that Members do not have to resign or participate in them or from the meetings of the Parliament.
However, the opposition party felt that, at such a crucial time, the last few weeks before the release of the UK from the European Union to 31 October, the Parliament should not interrupt the session.
The government's request for a break was announced by 289 Members against it was 306.
Two positions already after the conventions
The lack of consent for a break may be taken as a political revenge against Prime Minister Boris Johnson as his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the decision was considered unlawfully and unfamiliar by the Supreme Court on Tuesday) and that he did not want to apologize for it after the ruling of the judges.
Following this ruling, the House of Gmin resumed on Wednesday's session, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and an ongoing debate followed.
Johnson rejected the opposition to block the brixity and to avoid pre-term elections.
“It was time to execute the brixit.
It must be achieved to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit has to come so that we can deal with citizens' priorities, health services, cost of life.
Brexit needs to be implemented so that we can unite this country - said Johnson.
The Conference of the Conservative Party will start in Manchester next Sunday and continue until Wednesday 2 October.
The conference of the two main opposition groups, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson provided to explain such a long suspension of Parliament was the partisan conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders - are writing foreign media.
The President's spokesperson definitely about these reports.
“It’s simply not true - he wrote on Twitter the Blaze Spychalski.
Israel’s media, including “Haaretz” and “Jevish Insider, reports that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the New York Consulate, declared that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is an anti-Polish reaction to the rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katza’s words, which stated in February that “Police had dried up anti-Semitism with mother’s milk, ”
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating expression of his politicians.
He also mentioned the shares of aggression at Polish Ambassador Mark Magierowski in Israel.
In May he was attacked by a attacker who shouted: “Polak, Polak,
“The situation is not only inefficient.
It's simply not true - he wrote on Twitter, more than Spychalski.
He stressed that Duda “ never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland”
According to Spychalski’s portal, “this is what he invented. ”
According to the “JI” speakers, there was also a dispute between the survivors of the Holocaust, marked by the Commander’s Cross of the Order of the Service of the RP Edward Mosberg and the Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Dudy's words and to say that Jews from Israel are “those like Israel Kac” responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the Boteach portal, it was supposed to stop Mosberg's statement.
Who's Bansz, and what did he commit?
Founded by the stone basements, the journalist led to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We're going to sum up another affair, which has shocked the government camp.
In recent years, the “Supervision” newspaper revealed that Marian Banš, President of the Supreme House of Control, did not enter into a property statement of 400 metres of stone, which is located on the Krakow Podgórza.
Moreover, his tenant had sexbizzines in this stoner (so rent rooms for hours).
On the other hand, the building itself has been allegedly securing the repayment of the loan since 2016.
The irregularities highlighted Bertold Kittel in the “Superwiser” programme
The journalist revealed that Banasia's stoner rented people in connection with the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotical meetings.
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.
Banáz's charges were consistent with her and she was mutilated.
Interestingly, hired by the stone basements led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The stoner himself was described in them, and the income from its rent was to be humiliated.
“The mother of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth six to eight million PLN.
In total, spouses can boast of two homes, three apartments, savings[...] - writes Money.pl.
And according to the web analysis, Banasia's own stone was worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anticorruption Office currently controls Marian Banasia's property statements for 2015-2019.
Bansz announced that until she was completed, he would suspend his activity in NIK. “I will go to your holiday march, ” he said.
The opposition calls for clarification.
“We cannot hear that CBA expands its investigation or accelerates the analysis of Marian Banasia’s property claims.
That is why we are forced to hand out state authorities and make a notification of the possibility to commit crime [...] - said Mr PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
“If the normal Pole had so much valued renting its properties, he would already have 10 controls, tax supplement and group-sbytery behaviour, he added.
He went up high, fell low
Marian Banáš is the new president of the Supreme House of Control.
This position was set up on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term.
His candidate was notified by Law and Justice and by the votes of the politicians of that party adopted.
Previously, Banáś was associated with NIK between 1992 and 2005, he acted in this institution as co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of the PiS (2005-2008) Banška was the president of the Customs Service and also undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he again sat on the table of Head of Customs Service and since 2017 he managed the National Treasury Administration.
You've been acting Minister of Finance for three months in Matthew Morawiecki's government.
Cooler Master places a handle on the market for graphic cards
The graphics cards can currently weigh a lot, and this naturally makes a place for product categories, which would be in vain to look on the store shelf another decade ago.
This is the solution - the ELV8 RGB graphic card handle - presented by Cooler Master.

-Cooperation -: Ignore the order of the police will be punished
As the newspaper states, the dissuade of a warrant for a particular behaviour issued by a police officer is to be a new kind of offence, a threat to fines, arrests, or a restriction of freedom.
Such a change is what police unionmen want.
The idea has been sent to the Committee on Petitions.
\"The law is serious, because we are reading more than half a million cases each year to the Polish courts.
‘The Council of Europe has established that the petition, which the Independent Trade Union of Police has written to Members about the change of the code of offences, has a chance to succeed.
The petition authors propose the new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Destruction.
He would read: “Whoever is not subject to the request or command of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the laws of the law, is subject to the arrest, fine or restriction of freedom;
“Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who do not carry out orders, prevent or hinder the conduct of their duties,” says the journal.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said: “Though he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he is afraid that, if implemented, he may be used in matters of political manifestation.
\"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be detrimental and rather than mitigate the situation, even if it was strengthened, it would add.
The statistics provided by the paper show that 86% of citizens have been positively evaluated by police interventions in 2018 and that each month service takes 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
I've got Topol writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important postwar dramas of the Czech Republic, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
Thus, at Jáchym, she had a curse of talent that she was trying to use.
After eight years, he returned with “a sensitive man, ”
The heroes are Buras and Soňa together with two sons, but they do not form a typical Czech family.
They're wise actors, they travel Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth hasn't made a sound of himself, and for the second time he stopped at a time when he was born.
But they're not heroes that are the most important ones in this story.
Everyone is just a background to see a world where there is no longer room for artistic captors.
It's a world of tainted provinces, old societies, suspicious people and young people.
“The sensitive man, places, turns into absurd theatres.
Narration imitates the didascalia, and the conversations of heroes create the world.
Europe is faced with concern for its future, but also for continuous questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although Thomas Cook's British travel office has fallen, his Belgian fiiara Neckermann functions.

The Bureau then satisfied that the customers who bought excursions were going to go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the world's largest travel agencies, announced bankruptcy at night from Sunday to Monday.

However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, which resulted in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an extraordinary offer has been prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Actions are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the number of people in the city.
Görlitz is the largest city in Germany.
A beautiful pastel old man attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as “The Guardian” says, the city is struggling with significant problems.
At Görlitz there are lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a permanent settlement of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left west of the country, which translateed to a decline in the city population by 25%.
In 2013, it was 54 thousand people.
To fight depopulation, officials have come up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as 150 proposals have been made to the programme.
Two thirds of them were made by residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.
“When we applied, we thought that the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the participants in the project.
“Now we feel that it does not matter if we stay here after four weeks or not” he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the country.
While the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to get the opinion of the participants of the programme.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires are intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was” said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas about attracting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a pay programme for promising young specialists for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are being used in many places, from the Greek island Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the American Tulsie State of Oklahoma.
