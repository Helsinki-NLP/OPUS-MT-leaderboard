The Prague Stock Exchange has fallen to minus
After the morning's sharp fall, the Prague storm was corrigating losses.
The transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the daily trade.
The Prague storm has now established a fall of almost six percent from the beginning of Tuesday's trade to its Monday's fall.
This time, there's a fall in the Wall Street stock.
Even in our presence, there is a market response to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which has refused to support the stabilization plan of the financial sector.
Fallting stock in Asia
Dramatic fall on Tuesday occurred in the stock on storms in Asia, although the indexes eventually deleted during the day.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Exchange Index described nearly four percent during the trading period, but later it deleted part of the loss and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng Index China Enterprises, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares in Hong Kong, has fallen by 3.8 percent, has closed the markets in Shanghai.
The shares in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The storm in Taiwan according to the index there fell by 3.6 percent.
The timing of the U.S. rescue action is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,\" said the Head of the Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, is determined by monetary policy separately, thus regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly return to negotiations and propose support for the financial system.
Otherwise, others will feel the impact.
The bloodbath of America's shares
The American House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system to be spent up to $700 billion (mean CZK 12 trillion).
The legislators ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The US shares on Monday experienced a bloody spa and the main stock index recorded the greatest fall in over 20 years.
Dow Jones' index decreased by nearly seven percent and last recorded a fall in 1987.
The Index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal did not go through the House, the index was in a free fall.
Congress has resigned: US Government can pump 700 billion dollars into the bank
The leaders of the United States Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a wider form of an agreement on financial assistance to the US financial system.
The vote will be about him at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in interviews about the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system of $700 billion (around 12 trillion crowns).
But it is not won yet.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Agent Reuters said that to the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Sněmovna Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to sources, the plan could probably be voted first on Wednesday.
Economics suggest that the rescue plan is to be approved, the first major psychological factor for the recovery of the financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a pressure - thanks to the complexity of mechanisms to help markets to achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
We have made great progress.
We have solved our different views on how it looks like a market stability package,” said Nancy Pelosi's democratic woman, Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators met with American finance minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the ultimate form of government.
He should buy away from financial corporations free mortgage assets that bring financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the edge of a definitive agreement plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
There is still a need to continue with the healing plan, but I think we're there,\" said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is markedly affected by the stock markets that are falling dramatically.
According to the New York Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are so trying to reach a definitive agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm the investors against trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where the decisions of Congress could affect Monday’s trade.
However, it is not clear yet when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor whether they can take action at the last minute on a problem.
The legislators hope he will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still knows a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the aid of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible as possible as the President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amounts if it feels that the program does not fulfil its function, and that will be another $100 billion and then the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush evaluated progress in the negotiations
While the President may welcome this decision, Congress can vote on it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme which was to obtain funds to buy bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay off their mortgages is maintained.
- We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush is satisfied with the progress of negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the commitment to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.
Limitation of gold fireds
Chairman of the Senate's Banking Committee Christopher Doddd, the spokesperson, said that the legislators agreed to be responsible for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of relief, the timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit so-called gold parachutes to the director of the company participating in the programme and to establish a committee to have over the Supervisory Fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market for all Americans,” said Paulson.
The plan also counts with help for homeowners who have problems paying off.
The government should negotiate new mortgage payments to reduce the monthly costs for debtors and allow them to leave their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is based on the main economy of Patria Finance David Mark, a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
And that's because they don't know what kind of mechanism and at what price the problem assets will buy out.
This will be determined for how the financial sector and government share their losses,” said iHNed.cz Marek this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important according to Mark.
\"More importantly, it is important for the Congressmen to agree this week that this plan will be supported and that it will be explained as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is at this point the most important,” Mark stressed.
Gun for blade knives: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll figure out how to choose.
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can dial.
It seems clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
Still, there's enough reason to get a single player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the way in which the future owner is used and vice versa.
You may find it hard to get your top expensive turntable home to listen to Max Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such musical products on the LPG boards do not come out and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you are in your regals guilty of art rock, jazz or blues, you will probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It's the same with music on the road, i.e. music that's complicated, simple - music in MP3.
There are also valuable and qualitative categories.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns as well as Pink Floyd fans, it may be difficult to bite headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides to maintain battery
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles don't even happen.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone and texting, he can play music and video, both recording, he's got a better one, the worse camera, and maybe he can navigate.
And if we take smartphones and communicators into question, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV's photographing anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more mobile features you use, the sooner the indicator will send you to the charger screen.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy sharks.
A small phone can play music for more than 10 12 hours, usually it's much less.
In this respect, music players (specially the simplest) are much more powerful.
So, on cheap phones, you can count on them not playing you for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and there's a call, get one more charger to work for sure - that's also true for more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem comes when you upload music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the apparatus has a universal USB connector, and not each of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few cards reader will advise without reduction with miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
You don't need any special software for players except for exceptions.
All you have to do is fill the music over the USB from the computer.
Most of the mobiles and players will already create their own musical library by the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the user's evaluation.
Some devices display only a tree structure of directories similar to Windows explorer and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles are more capable of
When selecting a specific device, please be interested in the maintenance of the accumulator, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, the comfort of control.
If you have the music primarily with a bullet and if you listen to it just briefly need it in the tram every day, you just have to have any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which is already able to really almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much of what music cell formats or player can.
The MP3 will handle all and the vast majority of the music that will get to you will be in this format.
It belongs to the widest one, and besides it, most of the devices can also make music in the WMA format.
Less is the AAC (formate used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow for example to buy online music.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a good argument about itself for the acquisition of a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited only to quick-sighted hit radio.
Prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this way of selling music (it will already be over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will be controlled by the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you can remember your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is at home forgotten.
However, it depends whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every cell, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be a lot of price.
The cheapest ones are normally under three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you will already have a very decent fightman.
Most of all, however, will limit your absence of output to common headphones.
The best and technical side of the most sophisticated phones and 3.5 mm plug for common headphones costs up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy to handle.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum function, the similarity of control with an earlier common tape recorder or, perhaps, the phonophone is obvious.
There is no conflict in the form of a bug on the mobile internet and then a giant data transfer account.
Which instruments to touch
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant cards, you will be entered into 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported in basic models.
Only the most expensive ones will deal with 8 GB memory machines.
If you already have your phone, and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, bet on Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you better bet on specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungy).
These devices have a separate control button for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
It is also in Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from a series of goalsman have the same user interface as sold separately by MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a accumulator support (more than 15 hours, up to 35 hours) will give you MP3 players from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here-- a virtual operator who'd make the classics take off.
Maybe he won't be missing long.
About the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have written to Mobil.cz many times.
Finally, the Czech Republic also confirmed that the SMS price is higher than the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on roaming charges regulation, there may be a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are kept up so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxically, we have three mobile networks and penetrations up to 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to say that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvřák has often said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classical operator with its own network has no more chances (at least it would be difficult to search for frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators to the mobile market has just brought a significant reduction in prices to which classical operators had to respond.
At the same time, before the entry of the Scissor like Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile, similar voices were held on the market in Great Britain as with us.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Finally, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, more than 100,000 customers were able to get to this operator and become the fifth biggest operator there.
At the same time, a financial group of Penta stands behind Mobilking, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, U:phone.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more specific target group.
To enable them to function efficiently, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by the narrower offer of services.
So, perhaps Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers a text at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the Mobilking example in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move as well as a bet for an unlimited target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
“The administration of men elect Mobilking - an operator who likes and who they can trust,” says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say that a concept similar to that in Poland could also be caught in our country.
It is doubtful about the press spokesperson Miroslav Čepický: ‘The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are founded.
In addition, it is relatively saturized from the point of view of the offer of services;
In the Czech Republic without a chance, they call mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
\"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations do not look too promising.
More likely, there will be the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region,” said Jan Studničková in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jan Studničková, the press spokesperson of Penta's financial group.
In this way, it has been confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to do so.
Rather, he's trying to do everything he can to avoid a potential competitor.
The purpose of starting a virtual mobile operator is no longer the GTS Novera group, which would like to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telephonics O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have great interest in offering both strong and mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly dealt with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to move on with some of them,” says the press spokesperson Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe he's gloating for better times.
It appears from informal information that the first virtual operator should be waiting for us by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its creation leads to an impenetrable wall of silence.
We do not think at this moment that there is room for a full virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
Until now, no subject has approached us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area,” said Vlastimil Sršňa from the Press Department Telephony O2.
Other operators are also appealing to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobil's press spokesperson Martin Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the expression O2: -We did not record any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further,
And he adds: “In the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a specific agreement on the table to be considered in this short horizon -
Vodafone vampires his attention to meet the requirements of his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: ‘With potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider most of our customers.
The main strategy of Vodafon in this area is finding a partner for building a shared network for fast mobile Internet.
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The mobile operations can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, resulting in a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
The fact that when it comes to operators, they can pull behind one rope, they'll also witness the tahanice around the U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the ČTÚ went at the time of the creation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
This is confirmed by publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ website.
Now, however, U:fontes as an argument not to admit the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová pointed to this: ‘The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would impose high requirements on him and above all on his services.
However, given this approach, mobile operators are directly intimidating by the lack of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only the position of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no power to interfere with competition.
These belong exclusively to the Competition Protection Authority (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical attitude on the whole issue.
The introduction of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator with the renting of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential candidates was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators,” said Kristian Chalupa in response to our question from the branch of external relations of the ÚOHS.
It may not surprise representatives of operators who are thus formulated.
It is more than considered to be from the Office to represent consumers' interests and, inter alia, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: ‘In the abroad where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to reducing prices for mobile telephone services,
However, probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decline is not the interests of the SGEI.
In fact, shocking on the whole case is only a touching sum of three mobile operators that result from their reactions.
The question is, if it's really just a coincidence, it's offered entirely by itself.
Like the exact same price of petrol at pump stations, it is certainly just a piece of coincidence and a hard competitive struggle.
The Council did not find any sign of anti-competitive conduct in this matter, and therefore has no reason to interfere in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore does not have adequate responsibility for their market negotiations.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be a telecommunications controller,” said Chalupa.
Interpreting the dominant position in the market is one of many contested points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, whereby telecommunications is a single market in competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - to create a virtual operator, it is always necessary to agree to the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has a pretty logically - on his monopoly network.
So in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not admit this argument, it should be at least warning that three mobile operators are making a very similar course.
Thus, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that, when dealing with all operators, there are very similar obstacles.
The approval of responsibility at the ČTÚ is then in telecommunications with a relatively common trick to which ÚOHS gives its hands away since the whole matter.
We've met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until recently adopted amendments to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CNB's powers to competition in telecommunications has failed to settle, while a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by representatives of the ÚOHS more than well, but they are apparently their interests elsewhere.
That's what's going on when no one sees
Without notice, the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators, which have several in Czech mobile networks, remains without notice.
They are companies issuing their own cell telephone services pricers, but they are only partly public.
It's usually a multi-level marketing company.
This is how Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
These companies usually get to the chosen ones.
The spell consists of a company representing an operator as a classic company customer who order large amounts of SIM cards.
As a major customer then gets special price offers (and more) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibited.
“If there were cases you are talking about, this could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we could deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company concerned,” said Martin Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that similar activity to responsible mobile operators would not have been achieved.
In particular, in the case of three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
Not one of the operators defends such a procedure.
The activities of these companies have insignificant profits and, unlike true virtual operators, they do not jeopardise their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický notes the possible problems: “The effect of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, those must accept that SIM card is not led to their name on their phone, so they cannot be fully available to it as normal customers of mobile operators.
But that should be at least weird in the Czech Republic.
In addition, there is another question for OHHS.
If mobile operators take over a similar procedure of eyes, why do they block the emergence of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has a rather strong power to detect similar activities, and, if he does not want, he does not need to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea about any such activity and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already fallen several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has led to a noticeable drop in prices for services.
In fact, in all countries where virtual operators were formed, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Jimi's arguments used were practically identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory authorities, which defend not the interests of mobile operators but of their customers, have hit these very few moments.
Whether formal measures or informal pressure were then achieved by the development of the first virtual operator and on it were further packed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities translate the whole case as hot potatoes.
From our experience, we can't get rid of the impression that the inaccuracy in the competences is more suitable for them in these cases.
But let's not put the rope in the rye.
If the analytical information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be reunification.
If one of the operators admits to a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult to remain inactive for the refusal of others.
And we're gonna have to stop calling around before the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best.
Listen to four new versions of Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented a new recording of state anthem Where my home was presented to the Czech state.
Hymna recently recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlák.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in congregation submissions and instrumental texts.
The song was taken by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělolovek considers Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
The Czech Radio has previously said that he deliberately chose to sing solo versions of singers with young representative voices that are distinctive and popular.
“ From the beginning I was at both sides, and then the congregation sought to ensure that they had a clear dimension so that the text should be well understood to come together,” he said.
The Czech State Anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Construction Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlírka Josef Kajetán Tyla supplemented by the music of František Škrupa.
She gained popularity, and people took it spontaneously for hers.
The first song word then became a natural part of the state anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained independent of the Czech Republic.
How to say “new” anthem
Prague Public transport will take the first ride to the chip on Wednesday.
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be entered in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of paper tickets.
He can buy about one hundred thousand people who own Opencard chip card at this point.
Travelers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be paid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time get their chip card recorded at info centers and workplaces of the Transport undertaking in metro stations Museum, Bridge, Holesovice Tradition, Angel, Roztily, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská Garden, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can be purchased via the Internet from yesterday on www.dpp.cz's Transport Company website.
Over four hundred customers took advantage of the service by the afternoon.
Those who use the Internet store can definitely forget about the exit window at the metro stations where they have had to regularly stay in long queues on paper tickets.
The coupon buys it online, and Opencard will record it to them in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
“In these places, the passenger is available a switch with a trained service that will help those interested in online purchase and also record on their coupon card purchased,” said Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the library, you will be able to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines installed in several metro stations.
What do those machines look like?
They're red, they're reminiscing tickets and passengers may have noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovice, I. P. Pavlovova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be 80 of them,” he added.
Buy check the driver's seat with the machine.
The machine service that starts working tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is put the Opencard in them and the earlier coupon will be recorded on it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Then in the suburban flags and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which are driving to the capital, mainly the inhabitants of the Mediterranean municipalities.
The trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport are handbooks equipped with card readers, which provide time and belt validity of coupons, explains Filip Drápal from Ropid, which builds the timetable for Prague public transport.
The airport buses have cards readers built in the cash register by the driver.
Therefore, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to add Opencard to the designated place on the side of the register.
The driver will check the validity of the coupons.
“If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
Travelers who do not ride suburban buses and do not remember when they end their validity of the coupon may go back to self-service machines where they record the coupons on the card.
Here, the information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the apparatus.
Sudets wanted a referendum after the United States
Sudet Germans in 1945 requested the integration of Šumavy to the United States.
It's coming from a letter that's stored in the collections of South Bohemia's scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a desire, some of the members of the Sudet Germans turned their way to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is derived from a letter which has been preserved in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of South Bohemia's scientific library.
The Germans from České Krumlov ask the US President not to let back the “Sumav Jup” - taken by Hitler on the basis of a monk’s agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the right situation, and we want to be truly sure that the US forces come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” says the letter, signed by the words “Man, whose fate lies upon the heart“
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia is allegedly given to the Sudet Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national nature - the hope of only brutality, indifference, inconclusiveness, pressure and slavery, the authors ask the letter of the American President to take over the Sumavou protétété for the present and eternal times.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of the fourth million people, you would not grant this territory to a foreign country that is oppressing and decommissioning minorities and ruining anything, you would not have contributed to the victory of the Allies,” says the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign themselves is the fear of revenge - Christian oppressors -
If the President of the U.S. had reportedly doubted the idea of the Hungarian Germans, it was sufficient for the US President to hold a referendum in the country’s Austup on whether its residents wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of a letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, according to some of the memorials, it is appropriate to draw the expectations of the Sudanese Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least know that they would be relocated from the republic, few of them had even remembered the possibility.
Some have expected that the United States and Great Britain will negotiate a kind of autonomy to Sudet.
Another believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budejovice.
He was like a Bulgarian German man in war set up for the Balt Navy.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holštínsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that when they came home, they would be useful in Czech,” said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia thought that he would be removed from the republic on the basis of the Benes decrees.
You don't think you're gonna pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive actions aimed at road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it would be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch at the centre.
Minister Aleš Říbíčka promises to turn the driver away from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will show up on TV, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on flyers.
The driver should take off from fast driving and alcohol behind the wheel.
Also, remind them to join before they leave.
In particular, he wants to touch young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the sweats?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is what the “bloodful” campaign is about:
You don't think you're gonna pay!
You do not think of the word, it is written with great letters on the espétek.
And then there's a word in the blood pool--you're gonna pay--
It is meant to symbolize that a person can pay his own life in a moment of inaccuracy.
Spectators will be intimidated until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglosian countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims can commonly be seen.
He promises to reduce the inaccuracy and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The company has prepared Euro ESCs.
Sugar and drum on the driver
‘The sugar and drum system applies to the driver.
Sugar for them is that when they go red, for example, they save time.
The bull's a threat to fines or accidents.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,\" says the transport psychologist at Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why there's a need for information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, my psychologist.
Even less effective are the tables that alert the drivers to the danger.
“If a static table warning against danger is installed, it is likely that it will soon run with the surrounding area and will not be dealt with by drivers,” pointed out Korán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories by exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordánska, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did that in an interview that printed the Jediot Ahronot journal on Monday.
“We must reach an agreement with Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will have to be returned if not all,” said Olmert.
“We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to proceed with a similar percentage (the people of Israel) because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He admitted that Eastern Jerusalem would include any return.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want the tractors or bulldozers to take over his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert noted on two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mountains, the sacred and historical sites, which lie inside the Old Town.
“He who wants to keep Israel’s sovereignty above the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work,\" he stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for the departure of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an unthinkable condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some effort by Damascus.
“I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the Golan exit,” he pointed out.
They know well what they're going to have to give up to get Golana.
They will have to give up their current relationship to Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the Hizbollah (shiitian movement) of Hizbollah; they will have to give up permanent support provided by terrorism (shiitian movement) Hamas, (terrorist networks) Al-Qaida and jihad (holy war) in Iraq,” the Prime Minister specified.
Questions after the accident: Are the stevardi in the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know, walking on a remote bus can't be done
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus by Student Agency near the Italian Padov, there was a question of whether steaks and passengers can travel on a bus.
“If we want to strictly and formally follow the law, the operation of the Stevard is contrary to the road traffic law,” says Karel Hanzelk, the spokesperson of the Transport Department.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old steak last week seems to have caused a truck driver to cross the road.
Unfortunately, the girl sat next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash, or soon sound, even when the Stevard distributes coffee or paper.
Role plays whether the bus according to the technical card is equipped with places to stay.
If not approved on the bus, passengers must sit.
Remote buses Student Agency do not have places to stand; which is confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
We did not allow passengers to move at first.
We have called it off and we have reached out that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their seat, - he has said his opinion.
The law doesn't know the steak
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of Stevard - no legislation does not solve this role.
However, no regulation even prohibits carriers from providing services.
The road transport law only knows the date of the vehicle; its rights and obligations do not define, - it adds less clearly to Hanzelk.
On the contrary, the Director of the road transport sector, Josef Pokorný, says that the law is treated sufficiently.
-It depends on whether the bus is allowed to stand in the approval room.
That's what it ends,\" she says.
Buses shall be divided into urban areas where there are places to stand and a limited maximum speed, cross-town with a higher speed limit and distance-free seats with the highest speed limit and seats equipped with seatbelts.
Like on a plane, says an expert.
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Hořín in the motion of steaks on board the bus does not see a major problem.
The situation can be compared to the service on airplanes when driving in a smooth way.
Even here it is not certain when the turbine comes and the flyer can fall into the head -
However, if the bus was to sound quickly, of course, physical laws apply.
Like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of steaks must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations, - he says and speaks, from the point of view of the law, the issue is incomplete.
Jančura is willing to cancel service
Student Agency offers services of steaks as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession as risky.
\"As soon as I find that the occupation of the airport services is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers on board.
It would save costs, too, - she says.
As an interest in safety, he justified the absence of steaks in his cars as director of Asian Alexej Litvin, who operated a fraction of the line compared to SA.
We don't have steaks, we've been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it would end with some fatal injury,” he said before the next year for Week.cz.
A great tragedy has become.
In a link link accident to Naples, a young steak from Pilsen died, which worked for the company for two years.
Slovenia's truck is likely to explode without the use of the directions from the decommissioning threshold and blocked the route by the bus.
However, his driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he hesitated to avoid it with the right front.
That two places reserved for relaxation of steaks would be sold out, Jančura refused.
‘This location is not possible for remote connections, it is blocked.’
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the Ortel of the court, but the financial compensation is also expected by the guilty party.
Correction of the law?
I don't know.
The specification of the movement of steaks on board a bus could bring an amendment to the law on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works over a year.
Of course, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
Buses do not solve too much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile when driving,” says the expert Hořín.
“Ministry of Transport does not consider the operation of Stenvards to be something which would significantly threaten the safety of passengers,” says Hanzelk, with the responsibility of the police and the authorities of the security of work.
The Düsseldorf hope is Frankfurt
The big words in the letter from the Board of WestLB to the employees of this bank do not miss.
The combination of units of this düsseldorf cash institution with the Francfurt Deka-Bank will be created by the central institution of the financial group to settle in capital markets, read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to a letter to that transaction, WestLB will include a set of competence that ensures long-term revenues.
And they say that such a connection may be a decisive impulsion to further pooling in the Landbank sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Authority for the supervision of financial services, whose communication to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia is that it is time to find a solution for the future, it is still fresh.
The link between Deka-Bank, which customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever kind, is spoken for a long time - even on the Francfurtian side.
Chief Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting half-year-old management results at the end of August, let him hear that in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the Landbanks, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
The Deka-Bank Administrative Board, behind which it stands from one half of the Land Bank and from the other, established but entrusted the Board with the management of interviews with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be business or part of the capital market.
However, the talks have only begun, subjecting funding.
Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the more important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, with regard to consolidation in the savings sector, is not the first time.
In 2003, it seemed that the merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba could take place.
There was nothing out of this three together.
Shortly after the merger plans came to the public, the Hessen authorities expressed themselves against Helaba's involvement.
Both of the remaining bank houses didn't connect like that.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz has instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stutgart.
Even though speculations of the Deka-Bank merger with the Earth banks have repeatedly appeared.
However, recently, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke to speculation about the connection of his financial house with others.
However, it appears independent of the belief that it is necessary to approach different banking houses of the public sector.
Now, after the elections to the Landsbank Baden-Württtemberg, the first one could start drawing up the BayernLB connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not very good news for Helab.
If pressure is to rise to further mergers, it loses gradually the potential partners for such a connection.
In the south, only the second violins would play, even though the financial crisis is facing much better than the banks' homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
In the beginning of the year, the company ordered Hessen-Thüringen to establish a 50 % share in Hessen-Thüringen.
This would be the least of Nord LB's.
The geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much business models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question of the business model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the Landsbanks, the German Union had not yet responded.
It could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wishes to do in this institution.
That is why they also speak in the letter of the Board of Directors that they are seeking a “complex solution” for the entire bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect to the interconnection of individual components with Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfesto is known as the “visend with Italy”
It's for Elena's first time, for Lucu's third or fourth.
But this time Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and he says everything's gonna be different, he says.
After them, on the five-litre set of Kaiser, there's a stronger beard and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest prove how deep the tones can release his throat.
Elena Lucu will first sneak and kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From now, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, there will be four buses on the 23st of 23st45, with the sign-in-the-pasinazione Monaco, festa della birra - expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are used mainly by Italians, in one bus exclusively by Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And this out loud, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Marcovi, who wears a long coat with a lining from the copy of the fur and glasses with wide silver rings, three buses belong.
For five years, he's been driving them to Oktoberfest, just this year, he's got three expeditions.
In the night there, across the day between the beer stand, at 2:30, leaving again.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome beer drinker, cooked according to the Bavarian Law on clean beer, health insurance and German speaking guide Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go up to night, after a car park in the direction of Brennero -
Beer's not coming, not yet.
Bus shuts fast, passengers sleep.
They're doing well, they're going to need their powers.
It happens in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway no. 8 a.m. before Munich, there are also many other buses with Italian registration sign.
When Marcova's group finally comes to the parking lot near Theresa, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on a yellow cap.
On it is written on the left by Švabach - Oktoberfest - next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: -conoscersiviaggiando.it -
Second: ‘When the doors are opened to a beer tent, run, Marco calls to the morning air.
- Go - Go and serve places in the back of the tent.
“Not in advance, not in front of you, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, moving around the space”
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
Let's see if we're acting nicely.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone.
Third: “Today, exactly at 11:30 a.m., do you understand?
And up in Vienna, space with beer tents.
On the way one member of the group hangs yellow hats as tree signs, signules and even the election poster of one large Bavarian party.
You need to get ready to retreat.
As a “wiend with Italy”, the second weekend of Oktoberfest is known.
The exact information about visitors' numbers is not available; they are talking about 50 thousand people who are going on their way through the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend have arrived from Italy.
Several monk police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads national statistics in which Italians before Britain (about 60 interventions) and the Rakušans (ca 80) with approximately 200 medical treatment are serving their first place.
Especially popular is the state of Hofbräu in Italy.
Unfortunate night for the creditor Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word ‘realisticly’, and the fact that the German banking sector will not remain spared.
For the man has arrived last weekend.
The Dax Index monitored by the financial house specialising in financing the real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan from the German banking consortia of several billions to protect against turbines on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit assistance will go up to EUR 35 billion.
Interests will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually exhausted.
They say money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary of Depfa.
This state-owned financier, according to the newspaper report on long-term projects for which he borrowed money, has extremely short-term refinanceed, which is no longer possible because of distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank’s reserve fell by 95 % to EUR 2,37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenue and net income from financial trades decreased compared to last year to zero, revenue from increased claims and from certain securities and also from the cancellation of the credit trading reserve decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher return on compensation for subsequent settlement costs during the restructuring of the former Depfa group and on the reimbursement of interest under the tax order and for the brokering of trade for company companies, 16 % had been still moderated.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former State Financeer burned on nutrient mortgages, which were then released from the service portfolio and carried out by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little in classical state funding, Depfa was involved in more infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and state (Private-Privat-Partnership, PPP) and was internationally diverse.
From the value of their subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate has to write off something and these write-offs will have a fundamental material effect on the calculation of profit and loss of the whole group, as some have been told to hear indeterminately.
The fact is, the dividend won't be.
For 2007, two-thirds have been shorted.
Hypo Real Estate is a major financial funder for state and infrastructure projects since Depfa took over.
Stronger than any other institution depends on refinanceing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US investment bank, Lehman Brothers practically dried up the springs of interbank loans two weeks ago, because the banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of the Depfa credit portfolio - approx. 50 billion euro - short-term funding.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this credit for an early period of time, and the company is protected, before the influence of international cash markets is currently largely unable to function.
Other sources have been heard that refinancing is guaranteed by this money by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in an apparent period.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
That's what shareholders and creditors of banks hope for.
But in view of the dynamics and indifference of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank was late on Sunday afternoon, she seems to have stood in front of the insolence, she can't, she can't, save her passion.
The stock range fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, they held well courses of bonds.
While priority debts have virtually not moved, the courses of secondary bonds lose much more.
This mainly applies to the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically bonds with maturity after 2009.
The bonds Hypo-Real-Estate originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood after a significant deterioration of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought it into the company by taking Deffa, to understand depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity.
However, there may also be what almost no one dares hope at the moment - in the next 15 months the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time with this partial resolution, the likely bordering with certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This will be most likely to prepare a number of ongoing nights when they decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may at least use the limit line to generate a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange income later on for future payments of capital income tax.
Sylvana and the secret of a box of benet
When Sylvan Hiltrop's 16th day at the high school in Tačbana appears, the girls begin to wonder: the German is completely “cawaii”!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from Mang, and on his new blog about the exchange stay he tells about Japan.
First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been driven out of my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train on high school in Tačiban.
I had to find my own way, fortunately, I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tačbana is not given as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to meet after eight o'clock and 20 minutes ago, a short sitting with a teacher starts with a \"home room\".
But before school started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not even the kind of person who likes to talk to people, let alone 40 students in front of the class.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I took my old dress for my host moms, the shirt, the blue undercoats and black leather shoes.
So I stood up in front of the bench and tried to say the right thing: 'Sajónra Woš Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is next week.
At that point, I was very happy to learn my language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the classroom were fucking, chichotalo and mavalo, and I kept hearing the word 'cawaii'.
I've known that from my mong.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary stock of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'screte, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
A girl next to me smiled pretty much, considered her honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the clock was pretty calm, but when he called out, they literally threw me in.
They spoke one over the other, and they asked me about the impossible and yet it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then they all packed their bets at the break.
My host mother also made me a box of lunch, and that's something other than a boring German snack.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a pickle salad and algae, fruit and some fish in the tofu dough.
Most of all, I have no idea what I am eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
Sure thing is, everything's really good.
Well, I hope it's for a bacon-loaded plums, bru!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that he'll give a girl a self-prepared benet, which in this case is particularly artistically modified, and he hopes that the boy will get closer to his lunchtime.
That's what I read about in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo school for a year.
I always said,
'Cause he's just fascinating me.'
After all, it's been the best time to read a manga.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I began to learn Japanese once.
So I was absolutely clear that one day I'd have to come here.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're high-priced here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo's the biggest city I've ever seen,
And rats have feelings
When rats or cocksuckers run from danger, does that mean they feel fear too?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how could it be possible to verify that they feel the same when they behave like us?
In the online magazine, Edge has been published for several years by well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question: What you consider true without any evidence of this,
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without knowing it to me or anyone else, if we can't prove even that consciousness has other people.
But in this case, we can at least hope because all human brains have a suitable basic configuration.
However, once we start to address another kind and open our perceptions or general consciousness, we enter an inconclusive terrain because the hardware is not appropriate.
When the rat gets into danger, he will do what many other animals do: he will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People treat similar things that some scientists point to comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structures make it difficult to transfer our subjective survival to animal survival.
However, it is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include post-frontal prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area has been developed significantly more in humans than in other primates, and it seems that other creatures are completely missing.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, between them the knowledge that we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to believe that a person differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature could hide the language nature of man: because there is such a great part of his perception associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if the knowledge of the tongue did not matter, it would certainly affect his tongue, so that animal consciousness, whatever it is designed, would probably differ from the majority of the states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness is like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured, either because of special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, it builds us to explore it against great problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of conscious experience, but besides, there is another aspect of the consciousness that should be scientificly easier to be accessible.
It would be possible to examine animal awareness regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, particularly on the example of visualization.
But this approach to Christof Koch and Francis Crick is focused rather on neutral correlates of consciousness than on caustic mechanisms: both can be identical, but they also need not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of non-frontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What does that make for feelings?
It's because the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in a conscious brain, is active in its own activity.
What we refer to as “strach” is therefore a mental condition in which we are located when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences such as the physical reactions) will use operational memory.
It is seen from this angle that feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex characterised by primates and especially people.
We can distinguish and categorize the states along with ourselves and others in connection with language nature.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain stems dedicated to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, concentrates more on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could easily participate in feelings perceived by many animal families.
I can't possibly resist it, but I think it's inconceivable.
Panxeep argues that what appears to us in rats and people as fear is likely to feel both organisms as well: But how is it possible to verify, he says Panxeep, whether rats and people feel the same way when they behave like this?
Scratch in front of danger - does it feel fear too?
From my point of view, the similarity of behavior cannot prove to be true.
It is true that the neural comparison continues to move on: rats and people have similar brain strains, on the other hand, they don't have a brain.
But is he responsible for the feelings of the brain tribe?
And even if it was possible to prove it to a man, how would we like to prove it to the rat?
I believe the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cockroach (who knows) have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And because their feelings probably differ substantially from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and tongues), I study emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can wait for progress on neutral level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Like the rat, I don't examine the tongue and consciousness, I don't examine nor feel, I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to consider it short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than roll against the wall repeatedly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of EUFA Platini: Love period for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be managed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees U.S.FA's decisions in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME with Poland,” said Vasjunik.
But it's not an amnesty to our country.
Work has only begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.
In the early implementation of the plan of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports both hostesses.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
- We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible,” said Grigorii Surkis, President of the Ukrainian Union.
“EUFA will keep following us,”
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish PZPN Group was dismissed and replaced by an independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of Minister for Sport Mirosław Drzewieck.
He said that there is a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” said the Polish Press Agency PAP.
\"We assured the President of UFA Michel Platini by letter that he would not suffer preparation for ME 2012\"
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to a forced retreat in the last season, eventually had to move the start of the league quickly.
Disturbed Dennis Quaid Returns Hit
She wanted to make a new movie commercial, talk about private stuff, and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriagemaker.
He's angry, and he's coming back.
The late war roses with the former married couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after divorce, together with these two Hollywood actors lead an extraordinary dispute - before the public's eyes.
Meg Ryan first expressed her name in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week for reasons of her marriage’s failure: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful”
She said she learned about the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The PR's work for her new film, \"The Women,\" tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: “It’s insane,” said the four-year-old actor of the New York Daily News, that “Mag repeatedly chewes the history of our relationship and regulates it“
Moreover, it is “politating” that the joint 16 - year - old son Jack re - publicly resembles the pain and radical changes that are for each child - to divorce.
While Ryan's divorce lives alone, Quaid's remarried and has become a twin before recently.
It concludes its thoughts on decommissioning as follows: “My life goes on in any way.
I consider myself happy that I have an amazing family that are doing great.
Flights and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights according to one current study were even cheaper than 50 percent.
Flights and accommodations in hotels have decreased again - this is the result of a study of travel providers and financial services by American Express.
The company analysed its reservation data from the first half of 2008 and after the rise in prices in the first quarter found their significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of prices on the hotel market grew, accommodation in many places has already decreased.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 out of 48 European cities, on average by 6,9 % compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were 3,6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most probably this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
As a result of this trend, American Express considers a weak dollar exchange rate, which caused the pressing taste of American tourists to travel -
The price drop of hotels was also more strongly affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Kolín nad Rýn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices grew 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
Also, the flight prices showed an even higher trend in the first quarter:
Due to the cheating of the crosin, passengers in the Economy class had to pay by 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long distance flights were even scratched by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the flight prices dropped in Economy with an average of 12,5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in Business and First-Class classes, however, changes in knowledge were less pronounced.
In Germany prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 percent increased, in the second quarter decreased by 23.6 percent.
In German national years, according to quoted studies, prices decreased by even half.
One reason for this price drop is the slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increase in competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The sign of the tight situation is the distortion of non-exclusive lines by air carriers as well as the high number of airlines which announced the competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beat Glaběch 1:0
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the forehead of the table.
Luhukay continues to be unable to build a working 11 in Borussia.
He wrote Kristoffer Klein - to increase the failed landing for Marko Marina's representative.
This game player from Glaběch joined the game late and failed to break through the balloon on the pole.
His report was carefully reformed and made it sound convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the cabin of thehamburg arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break between half-lifes ended, and most people were sitting in their places again.
Rieger was an HSV physicist for almost three decades and he enjoys greater respect than a number of moment actors.
So his request was also answered in the proper place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol lured and picked up his finger for a sign of conformity.
Cornelius is the brother of Chief Coach Hamburg Martin Joel.
His order was probably like this: here with the other goal!
There's no such thing as an execution.
\"It didn't look good here today,\" said Marcel Jansen later.
I Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more freely.
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburčans thanks to the head of Mladena Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that very weak Gladosians could not harm the weak Hamburans.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summarized.
Hamburger SV celebrates its existence on Monday 121 years.
Thus, on Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the live updated tablet on the video wall where their team was presented as a premium.
It'll be a birthday without a proper party.
“We know how to evaluate it,” said Marcel Jansen.
It suggests that the ongoing table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than its HSV dominance.
Team with late arrival of new players - Brazilian Nevese and Silvy, goalkeeper Petriić also from FC Bayern obtained Jansen - although it is slowly located but still cannot shine.
“We need more feelings and more drifting,” Jol said.
Following a defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first report on the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by 700 points.
That was the biggest score loss within one day in his history.

The shares of Goldman Sachs have lost nearly 10 percent.
A few days ago, he had an interest in this company in Warren Buffett.
In the framework of the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage paper.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at the same time but in several stages.
In return, the State is to obtain a stock options list of financial companies that could be paid in favour of the favourable development of the exchange rate, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not known advice with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitation washing machine).
Experts are afraid that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not have been entirely correct.
Almost 18 years of age, the space probe-Ulysses, was flying through the universe.
She is now at risk of death in the cold, guilty of fuel lines that will soon freeze.
Among scientists for years one mysterious phenomenon has been a mess - an anomaly of gravity crack.
Gravitation washing machine is an air maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional momentum in the gravity field of some space body, such as Earth.
That way, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun probe Ulysses.
However, what scientists have been saying for years in this case in the wonder: flying bodies are not one hundred percent the way that a man would expect from an old gravity law.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity at speed.
Sondy's unexpectedly speeding up or slowing down.
Until now, scientists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by an anomaly of gravity crack.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of the material by curvature of space, would not have to be completely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and he tried to explain the anomaly of gravity washing using the so-called dark matter whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
“They will answer for this anomaly could be a dark matter that could also be found very close to Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravity force whose effect on the next space body can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, or visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fiveth of the total mass of space.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free.
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is once again free.
The beneficiaries of Sudan required a ransom of several million euros.
There were six kidnappers killed during the shooting before release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom deal is already on its way.
The Germans repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
Europe's tourists in the Sahar are apparently free.
They reported this to the Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabíja Arab television station and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to the news of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed: “Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We're checking their medical condition right now,\" said Frattini.
According to the Egyptian State TV report, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides in order and safe.
All 19 participants of expedition to the desert are apparently on their way to Cairo.
The most important remains the background of the shooting before the release of the hostages: according to the statement of the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudan army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom,” said the quoted worker.
It is said that it was only a hostage to take over when it suddenly came to this surprise.
Sudan's soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappers and two of them captured.
The kidnappers asked for Germany six million euros; the money was to hand over the German wife to one of the hostages.
Deník -El Masri El Jom - with appealing to one of the German intermediaries said that the release of hostages is being delayed because the kidnappers are worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female sex hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
The abuses of our lives - led to suicide -
Several years of abuses of our fatherhood led a woman to kill herself.
After he confessed to eight cases of sexual harassment, he was sentenced to six years after Michael Trerise from Stithians in Cornwall.
The General Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
“I feel responsible for her death,” Treris wrote in confession.
It was also said in court that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was a child who lived in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and binded her eyes and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the trial, it was said that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for National Trust, followed by the apparition of abuse, which was committed twice a week.
Ramsey Quaife, in the court, stated that in 2006, Miss Randle’s friends, who was also very dedicated to surfing and cycling, said she was “Emonically dead,” and that she gave up life.
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found a dead man in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's judging by the igelite bag.
Randle stood face in the face of his daughter’s father, who wrote a confession that ended with words: ‘I bound her and tied her eyes.
I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death--
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are extremely strange fetishist, and for your sacrifice it must have been terrible when she was only seven years old.
- This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done that, the matter would probably not have gotten to court at all --
“In particular, I would like to stress the consequences your crime on their daughter in the years to come,” he added.
- Apparently, she would be a promising, successful and happy young woman.
The official who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC has learned that the government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man concerned left two top secret documents on the train at Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
Documents got into the hands of the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
It's the least serious offense against that law and it's not a criminal intention.
The BBC Agent for Defense Affairs Frank Gardner said that this move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
“They probably thought that the matter was intervening between the Ministry and the Government Office,” he said.
A worker who may not be appointed shall be accused under Section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Chief Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to sue the officials on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents that he forgot contained a secret analysis of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
B&B debt is at stake in the cooperative deposit facility
The British cooperative deposit may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided €2.6 million for deposit protection in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion.
The interest of this loan will be paid to all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
The Director-General of the Association of cooperatives (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it was “concorrupting” that the components and members must pay.
Fourteen-year-old debt will be paid eventually by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgage.
However, the interest that happens in the meantime will be paid every year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Bank has confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are set up in this heading.
It is encouraging that these institutions, which have acted prudently... must now pay back some of the accounts of the institutions that have not been so considered.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company was to pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the deposits were due to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that debt interest will increase to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the deposits will have to find £81 million to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperative trade association, said the BBC that he believes it's not fair.
‘It is humiliating that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the settlement of the housing market must now pay back some of the accounts of those institutions which have not been so prudently considered.’
According to BSA, no deposit since 1945, when they showed up, it hasn't fallen.
“We will have to examine all aspects of this matter in the next few weeks so that we can see the possibilities to protect the cooperative deposit and their members from the account that might be substantial,” added Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
In the absence of shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk scratches by five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey milk company announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pens per litre from Monday to Monday.
It is this year's second price rise, after two-pent betrayal in February, and comes after research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers are to decide on their own if they want to be betrayed at customer prices.
The wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002 before February.
Kauce for Bangladésian Expremator rejected
Bangladesh's court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Šajch Hasina Vadjid to release bail, which means that if he returns to his country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her bail in connection with the accusation that the blackmailer received from a certain businessman over fifty million such a $729 700 when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges against it.
Chálida Zijáová, a long-term political rival Šajch Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sajch Hasína is supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Human League (Awami League), asked that the local army held by the government first give her full freedom.
According to the terms of her release, while she was released on an honorary word, so that she could enter into a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear that she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Order of the High Court.
“The Court of First Instance rejected the request of Shajch Hasín to bail that it did not need bail when an examination released abroad for an honorary statement was made,” stated her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
\"We will appeal to the Order of the High Court.\"
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail so she could return abroad to the country for preparation for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Shajch Hasín will return home after October 17.
She was arrested last year after the army held by the interim government took over power, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad to medical procedure.
Shaich Hasín and Chálida Zijá both reject all accusations against each other.
Fear of vaccination against defense in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children were not involved in recent violent vaccination against the defense due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations was vaccinationing in six provinces.
But she says she couldn't get to her children in the south in parts of Helmanda and Kandahar for safety reasons.
The UN spokesperson stated that this happened despite the Taliban's promises, he would not attack or defend thousands of female workers at work.
BSkyB lost the ITV case
BSkyB lost the dispute on the review of the Commission’s competition decision, which led the company to reduce its share in ITV’s competitive broadcasting.
BSkyB’s appeal procedure for competition argued that it would reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission has previously stated that BSkyB’s share has been competitive and has given a disproportionate influence to ITV.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 in a trade which, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virginia Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Office announced that the acquisition of BSkyB’s share in ITV led to doubts about ITV’s independence and called on the Commission to start an investigation.
Chief of consortium Virginia Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and controller Ofcom were all against purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was indisputable and as a disproportionate solution - especially because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigations of US lawyers' spheres
The U.S. Attorney appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on the afre drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislator and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators with a view to causing justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine stated in the report: ‘The fact that a complaint including potential crime negotiations has not been fully investigated or explained;
Name of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Ministry of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006 their functions.
At that time, the Ministry said that the lawyers were released due to weak performance.
Later, however, it turned out that the release of lawyers was no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to the conclusion that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of highly built Republican MPs and senators, and others refused to investigate the accusations against Democrats.
American attorneys are investigating and bringing lawsuits in court cases behind the government.
They may be released at any time but must not be removed for political reasons.
The head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under fire for release and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also gave up.
The report by the Inspector General was very critical in the role of Gonzales, and she said that he had carried out a “main responsibility” for the release that he had ‘abdicated from his position and in the course of the course of the event had not been excessively involved’
Other officials, including former High Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's power will be appreciated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf gets one of Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who, for his special gold prize, will come to the ceremony next weekend in London, said he was - honored - obtained by recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title composition of the Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
This year's nomination leads the Coldplay group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Reese, the main editor of Magazine Q, said: “There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.
A song written by Jim Steinman needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and it did not reach the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was held in the ladder for about nine years and sold it all over the world over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered in recent years by health problems, in 2003 he was also operated due to irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later, it turned out he had a cyst on his vocals.
Fucking streets, often forgotten, and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other ground roads, some famous ones, other only useful ones.
But even a lot of vets and long-term locals are difficult to find Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of him.
This tiny alley is in East Village and leads north of the First Street without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it is more likely that it resembles a dusty passage than a traffic move.
There's no sign of street names.
She's practically invisible in her ordinary atlas.
Yet, he has an alley admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants the Extra Place to re-exploit and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-standing neighbors who say they were shortened by a spelled alley because it was one of the last remnants of time before the block was caught.
However, the City Security and Development Office, which has a street in its power, is not least interested in keeping with it.
At the meeting of the district committee of the community, representatives of the city office and Avalon Bay had a plan whereby the developer of the street should buy.
However, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the General Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant when the streets remain in the hands of the city and asks for a new plan to be submitted next month.
“A lot of its own own is very little land, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in its possession,” she said.
“The proposals for correction and administration could be submitted, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility.
Avalon Bay a few months ago, she announced that she wanted to move off a small street and set up seats to sit, some of which would use a coffee shop whose interest in renting the area of the developer would expect.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was published for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay spokesperson, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily own it.
“The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this empty alley and make it a beautiful place for the public,” she said and added that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Office for the Conservation, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office was to develop property rather than manage.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a trace in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's big farm was divided between several of his children and that narrow strip of the country had no claim.
The Extra Place led the back door of the CBGB, the puncrock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps the most famous as the background of the photograph on the Ramones group album -Rocket to Russia -
“This place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took a picture in November 1976.
“It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes -
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the exploitation of the East Village district, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that a piece of public property should remain modest.
Others consider Extra Place as a rarity - almost unchanged piece of town that should be left behind as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah’s missing New York City (with a subtitle: bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the espionage process), raised a part of the story about the Extra Place from the rubble Talk about the city that appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark even on the day and bordered by rusty iron gates of warehouses and crowded windows, where the old newspaper runs during the streams during the week.
Except for a few exceptions, the street looked exactly the same for one last night.
The crisis ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a shop with expensive clothes.
On the walls was the graphite and next to the fresh dose of the newspaper, there was an empty bottle of beer.
A couple of walking around said that the Extra Place meant a few times, but it suggested he could use some kind of a trigger.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thought that some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its current state.
“Best years of my life, ” he said, “they were in dark, wet and disgusting places.
Debate of biling quality: in English
In this issue, Zaostrono will focus on education Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the positions of candidates for biling education.
Lance T. Izumi, a academic worker from California and a Head of Education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Higher than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools”
The effective address of Hispanic voters is a caring matter.
Barack Obama's education agenda just proves it.
Obama’s campaign points out that “afro-American and Hispanic students have significantly lower probability that they are coming from white pupils,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama’s educational agenda specifically promotes, among other things, ‘excess bilingual education’, for those who only learn English.
The question of Barack Obama is, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which puts emphasis on using languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let's take the Sixth Street Prep shop, a charter primary school in the Los Angeles East district.
The students of this school are in total most cases of Hispancie from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are only learning English.
Yet, in the 2008 state mathematics test, 100 percent of fourth-class pupils reached the highest level of incredible students.
Almost equally amazing 90 percent of fourth-class pupils got to the highest level in state tests from English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and exercise, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
In addition, Obama should note that, according to Linda Mikels, Director Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of schools for those who are only learning English, is a complete immersion.
Renovating to English emphasises almost the fundamental use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against biling education, said to me: “We have had a tremendous success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would go into class and not know who it is -
“It works for us,” she said.
Would Obama take school like Sixth Street Prep as a model, how should other schools look with great participation in Hispanic and English learners?
The results achieved by the school should be made of the answer to this question of self-evidentity, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-term advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education makes Obama’s answer more accurate.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, recently the matter was trivia when he said that people should stop worrying about “only English” laws.
Instead, you should ensure that your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to erase its performance differences, he should rather be thinking about educational models that work closely before he smiles and Trivializes them.
Ropa has fallen dramatically due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices have fallen dramatically on Monday due to concerns that neither the US plan to rescue financial markets would have had to restore the economy.
The prices of the fixed oil trades fell in the morning trade on the New York commodity stock stock by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
From last Monday the prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars per barrel.
In the past two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by financial concerns on Wall Street and also by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching the maximum of $45.29 for a barrel in July, prices dropped earlier this month to nearly up to $90 per barrel, which fell again on the wave of huge uncertainty of the financial markets.
As soon as the Presidency of Congress announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report has been subjected to fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a bank section of Wachova Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Lucemburg Government partially established European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital’s analysts said that the upcoming weekend negotiations led to a plan to rescue the economy have shown them as unable to restore the mood in the market.
As the economic situation gets worse, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decrease.
For global stock markets, interest rates and currency rates, the survey has strongly stressed,” said Deutsche Bank's analysts in the investor report.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape disease.
From the commodity perspective, our greatest concern is how much the American virus will spread to all over the world and especially to China -
This bank’s analysts limited their expectations for the next year as oil consumption fell due to slow economic growth and reduced their forecast of fuel prices by about 20% for 2009.
Wild ride in the second quarter overcame the team's record
After he spent more than eight seasons in Jets' dressing, his defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter in which Jets turned the pointless game into a sleeping ride.
I've never seen anything like it before,\" said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and Arizon Castals compared their rough game to the clouds above them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Lavernuese Coles to the twelve-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly presumptated the afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved forward by a mile.
Favre sent Coles out in this quarter behind two other touchproofs, including the one where the Cornerback fell, and the next 10 seconds before the middle of the game.
“It was nothing special,” Favre told Favre about all his credit cards to Coles.
He's a hell of a player.
We have been communicating perfectly, no matter what people think.
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked the quarterback Cardinels Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Regis caught a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards on touchdown.
Eric Smith's safets were on another cover and intercepted it.
Linebager David Bowens forced Warner to do the bomb.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens made was perhaps the best.
The Caterals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely 20-yard goal from the field, thereby getting lead 34-0.
That's what Jets has ever won in one quarter.
The Duke of Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe this madness, said: “The fourth or third quarter.
When he was told that both of them - Jets allowed 21 points without answers in the third quarter - Mangini said: “I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third quarter.
Many points in the short time section -
Restless Gebresessia has improved his world record
Haile Gebreses from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best distance runner ever when on Sunday at Berlin's Martoon overrun its own world record and became the first person to take 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
Winning a pleasant flat line in time 2:03:59 passed by 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebresessa, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - overrun the world record, or at least the world champion on all distances from metric miles to mart.
Last month Gebresessia left the Olympic Martoon in Beijing because he was afraid - from a look that may have been too much gone off - that the contaminated atmosphere will intimidate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the finish - won on Sunday Gebresessia with a lightning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As the track runners as Gebresessa and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer tracks, the Martonic record in the last decade fell by more than two minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebresessa told the journalists that he had a heart attack two weeks ago and left a week of training.
Apparently, the stop was more of a wake-up than it lasted.
“I’m so happy,” said Gebresessasie to the reporters.
Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine.
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, Eastern African rival Ethiopia - because he was overly planning his races, generally avoiding the world’s martonic tip, relying on conductors, as if it were a race on the track, and building world record over the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreseassie's enormous running quality.
Keeped at the rate of four Kenyas reached Gebresessia half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors were gone, Gebresess were constantly driven by two elite horse runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamati.
A little earlier than three miles before Gebresessa's goal last took over and escaped Kwambai, who then arrived in second place in time at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended third in time 2:07:48.
In the race of women, the great year of the seventh fastest history of 2:19:19 Irina Mikitínková, a native from Kazakhstan, now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holding Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Six-year-old Mikitínková surprisingly won spring at the London Martoon in time 2:24:14.
She left Beijing games because of something that was described as back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third martoon that she had ever run, improved her personal maximum by nearly five minutes.
She ran smart and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenya runners escape into the great lead, and then after about 18-2 miles, she pulled them out.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was seconded for 2:21:31 and Helene Kipo from Kenya ended third in time 2:25:01.
Goodness and obstacles to black people's lives in a separate city
Located between the wide entertainment parks of the Greater Orland, several miles from all the shiny, loud and huge, there is a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life survives.
Eatonville, the first completely black town that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neal Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as easy as she described him in 1935: “a city of five lakes, three croquets, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough cows, two schools and no prisons.
Now it's a mere place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival of Zora! to honor Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city that she described stays aside, even though she made it a tourist stop by putting it into a floridian tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, decent and private as it was in the 1930 ’ s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man, who knows so little that he doesn’t even know what they’re missing.
Even today, in the year when the black Presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the local residents remain cautious to the views of strangers.
“We are very careful how our story is told,” says the 59 - year - old Hortense Jones, who lives here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
\"It must be right.\"
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox triumph and effort.
It's both the historical model of black growth and the community of almost 2400 people, where poverty rate is twice as opposed to the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but it is also a largely shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes abandoned, sometimes praised - which was created from American slavery.
It is not too surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the worries of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way to say Hurston here.
She introduced the world to her native city through heart books full of lamentation as “Mules and Men (Muly and Men)” (1935) and“Their Eyes Were Watching God (His eyes followed God) - (1937).
The five reconstructions of the Floridian tourist guide changed the city a bit to road 17, which leads through the often overlooked centre of Florida, in the podium of black history and human drama.
With the stamp of the great drum in life and literature, Hurston's reader introduced the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark to the store, and then turned to a more special place.
“On the left next to the road,” wrote,“is a white brownly decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that always care about Howard Miller, even though it can’t read or write much”
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn was selling drinks of all sorts and anything that fits the hourly hotel.
So in just a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville became self-righteous, but also with illiteracy, reopening marriages and sex.
Obviously, this wasn't a typical record of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
\"So she said it as it was,\" says the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' congregations, who made Hurston immortals by quoteing men who sang great songs about their beauty.
“Some people didn’t like it,” she added.
Hurston still remembers here as an ecclesiastes who often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
The seven-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time she got into town, she arrived without notice in a huge Chevrete, she smoked and wore pants in a town that is proud of a decent dress today.
Most of the population was fascinated, said Franklin, but many were knocked down.
“The people of Zora have always loved to see,” said Franklin.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace with views of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, - never stayed too long -
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, currently Langston Hughes, and the only black man at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no more sadties or much public reading in Eatonville.
“I don’t think that even its meaning for the world, nor its legacy,” said Valerie Boydová, the author of Hurston’s CV, Wrapped in Rainbows, published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The Orange County leaders wanted to stretch the city through a five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way main road.
Orland's dissipation has already pushed the interstate highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a complicated historical period.
The initial integration, along with other things, ended relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, he brought the fight for the mutilation of the race of hatred to the threshold of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on people sitting on the side,” said Franklin.
- We actually had one lady who killed it.
They threw a melon out of the car -
In a letter to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court to forced integration and his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber declared it “for my race that is more than celebrating“
The people now claim that the deeggregation of schools, even though it was positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the young people.
“The Chinese children were used to hugs - I remember - you embraced your teacher in the morning, embraced your teacher at night,” said N. Y. Nathiriová, daughter of Elly Dinkins, and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took until then until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
“You do not accept your white teacher because your white teacher - I want to say that there is a cultural barrier,” said Miss Nathiri.
Yet, civil rights helped to create space for many more Zory Neal Hurstonová - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have raised up on prejudice with light-minded self-esteem and quotations, such as “How can someone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand.
In 1975 Alice Walker was led to an unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight for the recovery of her reputation.
Five years later, he went to the police in the bookstore of Hurston's résumé from Robert E. Hemenway, who reintroduced it into the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville once again found the light ramp.
Former Hurston neighbours now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its remote destruction, the community started planning Hurston's festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and every January many return to the party.
After several years, the state has resigned from the remote proposal.
“Those five streams of the highway raised up,” said Nathiri.
Boyd said it more simply: “Zora saved Eatonville”
Winning a remote project helped change the image of the city.
The non-urbans like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to walk into this church in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and the residents began to overestimate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named, of course after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to the re-inflated and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a floridian anomaly: only six miles from the centre of Orlando can sometimes act as a fallen alley in the summer rain, as small as it was based on only 27 black families in the 1980 ’ s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come looking for the story and the meaning of Eatonville, it is often treated with caution.
It is necessary to have permission for most interviews in advance and certain things - as wall painting in the oldest Eatonville Church, painted by white people, which depict black people in the fields - they must not photograph.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be correctly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival increased, domestic pride has also increased.
Especially young people are struggling to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, laboury, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, since he's planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or a police officer who says she'd have some help.
And even younger, such as 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonvy, as they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, when they pass through here, think: 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,'” said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
But if you really stop by and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city--
Here in New York, we all speak fluently financially.
Nothing's changed here at first sight.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper booths and giant television screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never agree that, in the cursed bee of the office, banks and managers of investment funds who monopolize New York, the worst day in the office - since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still roaching metal carts along the sidewalks and carrying the muffin peaks to the breakfast meeting.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mullahs, 50 ironed shirts hanging from the vases on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in front of their morning bagel at the street dining booths, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab on the daily day between the fourth and seventh afternoon.
It didn't look like a crisis until, with all the talk about pessimism, it decided not to start a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had time for this task so as to hide with late afternoon seven on my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were about 20 people waiting in the front.
Not in front of cash windows to pick up or save cash, but before switching, where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask about their way to trade mixed Macy's goods and new customers base their bills.
Most people before me, as I learned from Starra, my “licenct personal banker”, came for the same reason I did.
However, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called thrifts (a lot similar to those of building companies), money associations and those types of savings, which only operate in one state, and which claim to be taking care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have fallen silently.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets worth $327 billion, audition, and when New Yorkers came home on Friday night, she tried another bank, Wachov, with assets worth $440 billion, hunting a rescue buyer.
The staff of the offices and shops standing in front of me and afraid of another collapse moved their cash to the bank, which is perceived as a safe port and which makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
The usual New Yorkers have learned fluently financially in the last week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked to the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the broken bank, and to her exterminated top executive executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiality as if she was a smite about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, uniformed by about 50-year-old home of my business, changed the theme of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit at the bank, she said: ‘I have my savings in the money market funds now.
I moved it, I won't risk it.
Muslim graves hated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-hand side of the Free and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing parties Vlaams Belang participates in the manifestation presented in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 by the organisation-Asta against Islamicisation.
They carry signs similar to those shown by the mosques crossed by the red line.
The police are accusing right-wing extremists from defamating Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linze, there was some time between Friday evening and this morning heavily destroyed, and the police believe it was an organized event.
The guilty of some Jewish symbols such as David's star, but the detectives believe it might have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident has been linked to choices.
The spokesperson of the Islamic community said that they were “deeply shocked,” reports of desecration, which comes at the moment when the Muslim post month of Ramadan is approaching.
Austria, in the meantime, goes into the round looking for its own soul after the transport of last night's parliamentary elections.
Both the country-wide right-wing parties, which received more than 30 percent of the votes, the Party of the Freedom and the Association for the Future of Austria, have led to a highly anti-migration campaign and some of their slogans have been condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Free Party, who gained over 18 percent of the votes in the campaign protested against scarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to meals in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a “European fraternity” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of the furniture and minerals and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
The research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which put an extreme right hand in the position of the strongest political block in the country, suggest that this change has been caused mainly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to go abroad.
Gary Glitter, the glamorose star, who was sentenced to sexual abuse of children, has forbidden the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials applied this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were voted out last Thursday after she handed over evidence of Glitter's past judgments for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, his own name, Paul Gadd, had a hearing with Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
He said: “On Thursday, 25 September at Ashford's lowest penalty court, the Kentian police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr Paul Gaddd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not take part in a personal study,
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, how it would make him a record of the sexual attackers' registry.
He has to notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to pass the scheduled date of departure to the police in advance.
If the obligation to inform the authorities is forgotten, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that there will not be any case of Glitter's possible travel through the county.
The Kentian police spokesperson said: “The Kent police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to watch someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that control potential danger more efficiently.
To protect the people of Kent is the highest priority for the Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual attackers to reduce any danger to the public to a minimum -
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls 10 and 11 years of age.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was going to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in possession of child pornography.
The source of the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the secretary of the interior, is calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from going to France and Spain.
- To capture the real character, I take pictures of the master outside of the scene - Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of the flamenca, which is alienated from the concentration of interpretation - I can only experience the relaxed expression of men or women.
On the one hand, an artist.
On second, man.
Indiscretionable, if we forget privacy, in eyes far from the audience - then we can see a confidential gesture, depth of a long-standing view or passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to come out on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer shoots the “Flamenco-people” - theatre performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with less known faces of masters.
With this intention, the photographer draws up a unique flamenca iconography from various environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the moon of a photograph of flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), reflects the growing international importance of flamenca, says the author and explains that “Flamenco-people” can be any people, but if you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portraited on the street are artists able to carry on the scene passion, sadness, joy... and completely praise the audience.
It is not necessary to take photographs on the stage to capture the personality of these artists.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in the creation of a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flaglicans.
Fascinated by the festival - Cante de las Minas - started Bauer in 1997 with a long way of portraiting flamenc singers, guitarists and dancers on board camera.
These are portraits that thanks to the selection of the camera and material resemble classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic basis of the image and lends it to the present spirit, which is an idea that, according to Bauer himself, reflects even flamenco: ‘The music with very traditional roots that does not stop surprising and develop.’
What makes viewers do is not the work of dancing, singing or games itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
Search for the moment when we meet the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, it was and is the constant work presented during these days at the El Fotoma Gallery.
This selection of nearly 70 photographers is created by famous flamenca figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of antology flamenca and soon the pending book release, which will contain exposed portraits.
The passion for portraits brought Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea of ‘Portrétéch sports veterans’-SportARTproject.
Although their concept is different from “Flamenco-people”, the photographer admits that“to photograph people, to recognize them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think there's a portrait of the most difficult genre in the photograph.
One encounters or encounters people, personalities who sometimes don't even know, or they only give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite the similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to implement my ideas -
The collection of portraits of the current flamenca called “Flamenco-people” is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel with Alamedou de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel that writes was “throaty. ”
He plays in an environment that he doesn't yet know, and tells about the events for him unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llos intends to successfully reform his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and traveled also in Amazon.
Last night, at Hay Festival Sogovia, he admitted that the project that is currently employing him is a trophy - and that all of us is that I should not write - this novel.
“If I had sense, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it, and I believe that I will finish it once,” concluded his contribution to the festival’s exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which in four days saw aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city.
The author of the novel -Město and the dogs - was one of the main figures of the third year of the celebration of words and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickensova - Our musical friend -, filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Rome, he had before him a published audience, whose hour of time took place as a water - Peruanec with an amazing accuracy and a note of humor he remembered how he lived in it from the original “unbelievable adventure” - from“the comfort of the passionate reader - and from“power to live more than what I had lived, the literary mission was born; as he did, the lack of inspiration - by writing“discipliningly - carefully the word, corrects and translates; or how they affected his writings Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas and what memories are the basis of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that “there is no way to find out whether and to what extent books can change their lives, but I refuse to believe that literature is a mere entertainment, a sharp experience,” stressed Vargas Llossa that he claims to be acting“ and“ trying to move them out of a line - and called on writers not to be “privileged with their responsibility - their mission.
Due to the climate, the festival is lost in Popoblanec - missing copies
The performance with the hills that closed the ceremony in Pozoplanec was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the effecters that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
Therefore, the company and Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosou de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández decided to cancel the bullfights.
The adverse meteorological conditions of this celebration are long-term, two of the three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday, the rain stopped the course of other planned bullfights.
During them, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
But that's the only way to celebrate on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and a reward for dynamic and aesthetic quality performance was suspended on his shoulder.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two wounds by kicking for greetings and one ear that brought him more of an uncovered seat in the arena than toreadoric art.
Even worse was El Juli, who went through Los Llanos' exorcise, unsatisfied, unsatisfied.
In the second round, he earned a sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They ran checks in Alava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish.
Ten minutes five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
The servants stop two persons in the van, and they ride them.
Cost, more than two tons of fire, is not to stop.
According to the report from the branch of the Basque Government, members followed them and held one of the persons who were in the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A.A. J.
Arrested was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road control at N-1 in places where they pass the border of the Armiñón district.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver did not follow the instructions, quickly speeded up and ran.
The car's servants began to flee immediately when the vehicle stopped a few kilometres away from the side, and at that point both passengers jumped out and took off to the forestland.
The Ertzaintza's servants finally caught up with one of them and seized 2,78 pounds of hashis, who were suspected to presumptuously transport as it came out during the Iveco Daily delivery tour.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with packages of fires, which were subsequently transported to other police departments to detailed experts and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the registration mark was ‘noised’ and did not agree with the data provided in the supply documents, therefore, it was also accused of falsifying state documents.
The Ertzaintza continues to look after another suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the drug packaged.
Arrested A.A. J., 28, he was transferred to the police department to establish adequate formalities before he later came into another investigation.
Heather Locklear's actress is being detained for driving under the influence of drugs
Heather Locklear's actress, the favorite Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was held in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend for driving under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her perform the unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, told the People magazine the California Road Guard spokesperson.
The witness stated that around 16.30 hours, Locklear had been on gas, for the loud storming she was moving forward and backwards, and tried to leave the parking spot - she wanted to have sunglasses at the time.
A witness who didn't seem to know the actress saw Locklear at the moment after stopping on the nearby highway and leaving the vehicle.
This person also pointed out the rescue service because “he was worried about Locklear’s life”
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the truck.
“It seemed disorientated, therefore, its members took it to a specialised drug and alcoholic centre to undergo a test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and the excess amount of alcohol was excluded, yet, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was visible to the guardians at first sight.
Locklear was arrested for suspected proceedings under the influence of the effects of an unspecific substance and was taken into custody around 19.00, even though she was released for several hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she recovered from anxiety conditions and depression.
Llammares insists on the Andalus Association of IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The General Chief of IU and Member of the Joint Left Gaspar Llammares today said that the final decision in the case of the former Advisory Department of Youth and Sport at Seville Francis Manuel Silvy, who resigned from the office last week after being charged with the negotiations in favour of his family, will depend on the regional association of the Party.
“I am an excessive federalist, it is on the Andaluian organization to exercise its powers,” suggested Llamazares to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Civilian City Council.
However, Chief IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation into an illegal conduct committed by Silva, it is absolutely necessary - transparent -: ‘IU has always fought for such matters to be sufficiently transparent -
In the same way, he stressed that the party had a ‘street ethical code for all public functions’,
('Sangre de mayo'), Epician bet Garcia
José Luis Garcia in the film “Sangre de mayo”, inspired by Epizody from the national past by Benita Péreze Galdóse, restores the famous rise of Spain against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, he wanted to design a film creator - to draw the ecclesiastes of the character and analysis of society - which he always admired in the works of the famous novelist, he explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film before a large team of interpreters.
May's blood and mertriosis over two and a half hours will be put into the cinema this Friday, and in the future more than a four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdóse José Luis Garcia claims to have fulfilled the “Children dream” for which Esceranze Aguirre owes him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid entrusted the film to the two-year anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer that the story would come out of the Episid national past.
The budget of 15 million, which completely contributed to the Madrid province, means a unique opportunity for Garci, to create an environment with cults and costumes corresponding to the “third Spanish” image that was wronged in the leader for whom it was possible to fight for independence, led under the Ferdinand VII government to fall down and the country’s stumbling,” he said.
But the director regrets that he can't count on the financial support that came from the sad wing (Ala triste) or Goy's sight - almost twice the May's blood - so he couldn't film some of the scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horaci Valcárcel, which he works with almost all his film track.
The director is working on the stage with actors who usually do not choose casting, because it does not appear to be “favouring”, and he also believes that“the director’s job is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and to see what is happening in the craftsman’s business.
Many actors who have chosen for May’s blood appear already in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations in Oskar, one of which he gained, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, alone May's blood, seven tables of French billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, does not present a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that “this is just going to appear”
There's no award for this movie Garcia.
“At first you think you work for what will be after, but then you realize that you only work for earnings, and so you'll allow yourself to make one more film,” explains Garcia with more than 30 years of directorial career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Seville Dancer Tórtula Valencia
The Sevilla dancer flamenca gives up the homage of another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, father of Catalana (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived her life full of passion, was a pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the cancellation of a corset that made women move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the interwar Europe of Isabel Bayón has been taught.
\"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me -
According to the dancer, it's not about telling her life, it's about understanding her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of the flamenca.
So me, a butterfly, shocked the guajiru or a ‘tank snake’, some tango.
Her dance was reasonable, and they told me that my dance was also in line with this aesthetic,” she says.
The presentation is calculated by involving two exceptional personalities: with Miguel lead, which Isabel will sing in one performance just like in the \"Open door\" (La Puerta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her ex-wife.
“Mattilde represents an older Tórtol, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me -
The performance also includes music and guitars Jesúse Torrese and Paca Arriagy, with the singer Miguel Ortega, el Pullgy and Moi de Morón; drums El Pájara, violou Raf El Viola and co-workers of Juanfry Juárez, who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, which is primedon with all of them, and who are always in love with them.
The work also takes into account the life of this woman who took place at his time in such remote places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as all over Europe, because she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her creation,” says Bayon.
The presentation starts at the Lope de Vega Theatre today at 20.30.
The book -A new woman's diary - closes the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the Deníky of freshly married, in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), on the spot where Juan Ramón Jiménez concluded a marriage with Zenobi in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalu Government for the celebration of the Zenobie and Juan Ramón (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the award of Nobel Prize for literature and the anniversary of their death.
“Trenal Zenobie and Juan Ramón are going to end with the new edition of this work, an international congress that will take place in New York, the repair of Nobel's museum house and the Putting Exhibition“Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Onen sun ray, which was opened in May this year, and after the various Andalu provinces pass, should be moved to New York according to plans at the time of the Congress.
The cultural council of the Autonomous Andalus government also ordered eight hundred copies - Denik freshly married - edited by Pedrem Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of personality and work of one of the world's world's world's greatest poets.
America without Paul Newman, she doesn't like herself that much anymore.
- Sometimes God will create perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them--
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who cooperated with him on “No evil intention,” and under the weight of knowing that Newman left, reveals his unsatisfied vision of the abandoned American cinematography and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that she knew she was very sick.
Even though he was a man to all of us.
“Sometimes what a person feels can’t express any way, and I have now lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, “My life and my country were better thanks to him”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overruled.
The father died of film and country in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American confidence is at the bottom where they desperately seek reasons for pride.
When the time is rough and people with no virtue and only a handful of those who stand for your admiration, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embellished almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and the fighter for even the winning cases, from the foundation against drug addiction based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose, to his own brand of home food and biofood.
A complete treasure for the country, which has cost a lot of effort to get away from suicide food culture.
The stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, said he didn't die one man, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, the holder of Oskar for directed by Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the top of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, to mark his greatest source of inspiration.
“This fox put us all on a pretty high line,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to live like Paul Newton, based on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the cameras.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newton is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough opportunity not to be.
Why would I go out for a burger when I have a filet at home - I like to joke.
May he be proud in heaven that there is a relationship between his daughters and admirers in America that is too common.
It is said that, from all the great roles which he had embellished, he was the proudest man in the role of a dedicated husband, loving father, a willing grandfather, and a sacrificeful philanthropist--
An imperfect race of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the last year of 2012.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're driving the race last night, I'm like, no!
They were talking about him as a perfect race, and according to my court, it was the worst that I've ever been to.
A lot of nonsense, right now, if there was an evaluation, and I was trying, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
The nonsense begins with picking up the race numbers that make a man come out early for.
I don't feel bad, but when a man goes there, let him give it everything (including a chip to avoid overrun).
Oh, no.
This is where you had to pick up the number (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after the proper queues stand) - what a surprise! - they had only a T-shirt of size S (the second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
This is because of the crisis that they decided to buy only a small shirt because it's less than a substance and they're cheaper?
Well, they're little compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Except that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front lasted for over 15 minutes, he had to give up his backpack.
Over 35 minutes, it took a waiting time, which is at a race where 11 000 people are expected, something inconceivable.
So, as we could expect, the race started, and we haven't saved our backpacks yet, and when we did it, it was much worse to pick up.
Moreover, waiting was extended by 40 minutes of rain, leading to general awakening and attacking the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have an inflammation of the gland tomorrow and some like me will not show the right time in the evaluation of results due to the chip that they gave me and which, as I suppose, did not notice the start time.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't have attacked me.
And so I think we're gonna have to keep the Olympic city well prepared.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction to the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic acts as calling a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the whole complex of society) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and system that recognizes shapes and faces, this “reception” can determine how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He also knows how to disassemble those present in conversation groups.
The demonstration video records a third person and understands that it does not belong to a group who talks to her, and that it is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her she's going to take care of herself in a minute.
That's all without a blue screen of death.
That's wonderful.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, for example, a new version of Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of talk was about changing Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial unnecessarys, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as a game when considering that Microsoft version adds new features to Windows and more -extra -
Change in direction would be a favorable act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who applied to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is necessary to understand the layer between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother.
That's right.
He will never disappear, but it is necessary to think about the “dead” operating system, not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more online browsers.
The computer is switched on to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around the windows.
What is half of the applications that run the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its online services and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They need it, and I have a little example here.
I took this photograph in one rest facility for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drinking machine there was a poster asking them to use their search tools: ‘Your search.
In 2006, she showed an independent study that 66% of Microsoft employees were used to search Google's Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new Windows Mobile 7 version was confirmed.
He won't come to the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so we'd better count until 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone's becoming more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it on the Azure coast, Leonardo di Capri in one of the lights in one of the \"Creative Diamonds\" - Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the \"Kmotre\", Francis Ford Coppoly, and in addition it is part of the uniform muscle gay community.
And if we want to go to the reading of his life's roles, we can dive all the way to the picture of a typical muscle with a pointy moustache that lifts the action in a cat circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton male lower weight, aggravated and without sleeves.
English spokespersons call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels gets out of all the others.
First of all, for his critical name - although people are called 'Marcel' - who has a connection with sport, because, as he tells the legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lovers of Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing the label and (usually unknown) Belgian flag, which have models of the most emblematic teds as detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not specialize only on tank tops.
They also produce bowls of college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, marine shirts, suits for children, mini shorts...
Thinked pieces for comfortable undergroundwear.
Although it's a shame to be just a underwear.
They're too beautiful.
\"I want to be a young mother, who will be a father doesn't bother me.\"
She did not stop her sister from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, although small characters, is a woman full of life.
They are taking their new action in fashion now very seriously by Sister Cruz.
It means a lot more to Meonic than just that some nice, famous girls will lend their name.
In Paris, the promotion event organized by Mango in its new headquarters, as well as the publication of the most important fashion prices that the Spanish company sponsores.
She's heartless and shy and close to getting you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that we proposed for Mango for the autumn-winter season this year, while at the same time attending the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards, and dinner in Opera for the honor of Valentina.
It was therefore a demanding but also exciting day.
What's your new Mango collection coming from, for which you've been working for the fourth season?
Me and my sister love movies from the '50s and '60s and we've been drawing many suggestions.
I also like to wander around town and watch women walk around dressed up like they're mixed up and they're all dressed up, and I do that very often.
You're a dancer, actress, designer, that's a very versatile woman, isn't it?
I think so, but everything is connected, and it has many connections.
Maybe she liked clothes from me, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk to my aunt's closet and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the bond.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to care about how I was dressed.
You know, we dancers are starting to think about how we're prepared to feel good at our hours and tests when we look into the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been 30 recently, have you had a crisis?
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever been before, 30 times I'm having fun.
I find that a woman is already done, has experience, and life enjoys less faults.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I almost do what I want, and that gives me great internal happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body is asking for it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
If it's about my father, I'm not worried about it.
But I know one thing, I will give my child a feeling of happiness, and I will raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, there are several premieres in the movies you filmed last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I'm from the theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and that's not going to happen.
I look forward to the Prime Minister - La última hora - a-En busca de la tumba de Cristo
Let's see how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the pier next to Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm gonna go stand on a pier as a model.
Only she called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend the Beneficial Show for her organization -The wife for a better life - and the clothes we've been doing - I also selected two models from our Mango collection - and the extract was presented to this Naomi NGOs.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things about her and I, as I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good guy he's involved in.
She asked me to show for charity, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
I'll do what needs to be done for women of the third world.
The drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in the blood will have to install the ‘alcolock’-
The Ministry of Interior requires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol must in his car install a system that prevents him from starting his car in drunkness or if he does not breathe.
The proposal has already entered the knowledge in June this year and is now already included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representative, according to which this is a pilot project, which lasts one year.
Its aim is to return the driver to the wheel, so the drivers will also have to attend the traffic course.
In addition to this experience, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technology Institute for Car Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics between 30 and 75 % of the carers charged more than once for driving drunk in this state, he will again sit behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this from being a system connected to a vehicle that measure the level of alcohol in the exhaust air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds 1 000 euros and would have to pay it to the vineyard itself.
The study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that 65% have decreased in the case of vehicles equipped with this device during the first year of introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that every year could save the lives of 115 people.
The measures are limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: in order to address this conduct before it has been committed in a criminal offence.
And in order to help its introduction, as the law can be implemented in a normal way, the necessary regulation of criminal law requires a change of law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market yet, even though it has already been installed in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Right tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spaenian Social Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without \"peeptoes\"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 hours, as it stood in the program, it landed at the Presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in México D. F. plane of Spanish air forces where the Prince and Princess of Asturia arrived.
However, the sun has just fallen, its rays have so far forced to cover their hands in order to see the subsequent pair coming out of the plane.
Under the meeting there was a Spanish ambassador and other activists.
A few hours ago, I asked the cab driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to a public visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it won't get to the airport to pick up people... she's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spain, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press knows well who the prince and princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
A lot of people are waiting at the airport hangar just at the red carpet and the military cordon, which forms 27 Navy soldiers ready to shoot an honorary room.
The prince appears with a smile on the lips in the dark blue color and princess suit, very soberly dressed and with broken hair, does not have her usual “peeptoes” - they probably reported to her that there was a storm in D. F.
Before they go to the O.R. where the official delegation awaits, they smile for the photographers, and they fail to delay them.
At the doors of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the top four in town, there is a dedicated Mexican television reporter waiting for them.
Best-used fashion price
Perhaps there is no more suitable place in the world for the publication of fashion prices than Paris, and probably is not a more significant designer and bonvine than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation to new fashion talent.
The price is delivered by EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandra Beani, winner of the first year, yesterday she looked at her designs in Manga's opening on the Haussmann Stock Exchange No. 54 and almost cried for milk.
Of course, it's the second largest trade of this company in Europe and it's just opened to a surface of 1 335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank Valentine's designers for taking over the Presidency of the competition jury, have finally caused us to have dinner in Paris's Oper Garnier.
Firmou Mango, a solemnly decorated chair table, looked next to the most prominent Chagall works even more amazing.
Nati, who had not seen anything with the heart of a broken grief because of the recent death of her brother, dressed up the dress of this brand and the jewels of ELAH, over which he kept his breath, and hung up with her son Luis - almost two-meter elegate - accompanied Valentin at the front table at dinner at his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango's company, welcomed himself, and as a real gentleman, he stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, because they both offered them to two ladies.
Mónic Cruz, who arrived at the store in - self-designed pants and shirts, and at dinner she changed into a long black sex dress, touched the night walk after Opera accompanied by Goyi Toledová, showed us the baller test hall, and when remembering other times she caught one of her poles and suggested that the band had been taken.
Inés Sastre, she didn't stay on a tour of the side buildings of the palace, but before she left, she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning, we could have loved the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel with his own bed sheets and towels and asked that no scent be used in his rooms.
The stars under the starland sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - countertress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget chaotic and permissive everyday life.
And so that there is little, they are all summarized in one book that will bring you to bookstore relax on September 30.
The alarm bells every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse to imagine itself absorbed in a speedy rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one method nor two ways to fight daily exhaustion and to the problems of getting away from the world of work.
No, the number's no bigger than that and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriottt outside of the yoga position, classical massages and-spa - therapy on the site gathered the entire -menu - options, modified according to the taste and time options of each individual.
Protistres book is called -101 method of relaxation - and thanks to the publishing of Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookshop.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, the handbook is denying this view.
In addition, it offers more procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% of the natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have an adrenaline in your veins, which in your body reinstates balance, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on the reading.
Sleeping conversations
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids he talks while he sleeps.
When it happens for the first time, it may freak you out, but it's actually meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquivia.
She's quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you said he was sleeping last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in high fever), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once in a few months...), the second day the child doesn't remember anything.
There's only one reason why she'd be here.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, night whites, night ouresis (new aid) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be.
As mentioned earlier, it may often be accompanied by a very high fever, stress or a more widespread situation.
In any case, it's a small phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak with a calm voice, say the words, whisper, or vice versa (cryings, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where a child is shown with great power, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with an expert to see if there is any problem that causes great anxiety in him and thus manifests itself.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is treated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do so by remembering several very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to upset a child too much before sleeping.
Search for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent television programs or serials.
In very nervous children and those who can relax the work, it is possible to use relaxing techniques to help them get some internal peace.
This baby will allow a calmer sleep.
When the son-in-law appears, try to stay calm.
Remember, she's harmless for a child, and that from what's happening, she won't remember anything else the next day.
Useful advice
Don't be.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're breaking his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and then rests.
Remember, if you seem to be very concerned with yourself several times, it would be appropriate to ask for advice or find out what is causing such anxiety in your child.
If he understands what he says (which is not so usual), avoid temptation to question him and draw information out of him.
It won't be any good, because when he sleeps, he's not aware of how he can organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he seems to know, and therefore why he says so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you are about.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even funny.
This causes great anxiety.
Don't worry, it's not bad, it's just an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory after a long weighty period.
Without playing a particularly big game, yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them into victory.
The game did not happen during this clash, in which the attackers were only difficult to enforce, too fast.
After the first attempt by the captain, Kauffmann, who shoots from the distance only about the flag of the last link, began to have Illhaeusern lightly on the top and first Fonderflick from the distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to challenge the defense of Dannemarie.
The player, on the other hand, built a defense field in the middle of the field and left only the Agil Riahhi on the field of attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, first due to the two Dannemarie chances with Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well-established for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold experiment (53).
However, Gólman Illhaeuser did not enjoy a long time, for about twelve minutes he was forced to return to his wardrobe and leave his fellow men at a weakening.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to cope with it and 11 of Illhaeusern, which just pulled off a little bit so as to “heaven” the defense, no longer caused any greater trouble, except the last seconds of the struggle, when the ball passed through the big confusion very close to the burden.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before leaving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride across Brittany.
To face the demonstration of the forces of fishermen who strongly disrupt the accessibility of several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The last names promised that they would be adopted in a constructive spirit, and they would hope that they would come up with specific proposals.
The President’s visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the Crimean Committee, created by the British fishermen, with a view to obtaining measures against the sharp increase in the price of oil, which reached an average peak of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesperson of David Martinon's Palace, the President will talk to them about solutions that can be seen in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and payment of seamen.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with inaccuracies.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out an operation - see - (operation of slowly driving vehicles) in Morbihan and Calvados departments, resulting in a total of 10km of traffic.
The Quiberon recreational port has also been blocked, but the link towards Belle-île has not been interrupted.
There was a filter dam in the Quiberon peninsula.
Marines have shown their determination on Monday, when at dawn before the warehouses of the fuel ports in Brest and Lorient were burning tyres and pallets, while the Concareau and Saint-Brieuc were running demonstrations.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and to the La Manche channel, like Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trams remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of the business ship.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area during the evening stopped the block of important refineries of Total in Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act on their own orally until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the Commission is to decide on how to continue on a stand-alone journey and on its participation in the preparatory meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by heads of the State Fisheries Department who did not support their movement.
“The stop will continue, since the banks will not leave anything - and they will not want to go to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Department, Lorient.
Farmers who do not pay their oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but the ship’s yield threshold is only achieved if it is below 0,30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman Glorious

Embraer maintains its assumptions of supply for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relys on a supply of 215 aircraft, through a threat of recession, which takes place over the world economy.
The fourth air constructor in the world, Embraer, retains its assumptions of supply for 2008 with 215 added instruments, confirms his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian constructor promises a lot from the Chinese market, in particular he takes into account the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients today in the range of eight years.
AIG said it considers the representation of 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, which the US monetary authorities have received over water, considers that he would have made more than 15% of his assets in order to pay back $85 billion given to him as a deposit, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, clarifying the journal, which quotes the sources of the ongoing negotiations.
The AIG Administrative Board, according to FT, met on Sunday during the evening to examine the evental delegation.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets which AIG intends to get rid of include its branch of the International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, FT.
No final decision on these missions has yet to be adopted, continued by the FT.
AIG must quickly obtain cash in order to repay the loan of 85 billion provided to it by the Federal Reserve Bank, with a risk that the US authorities will consume 80 % of its capital while at the same time tearing it apart to the significant ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the bank: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, which is an unwelcome loss of close to 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14 %.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777,68 points to 10 365,45 points.
The biggest point fall in its history (by 684,81 points) recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the renewal of trade after terrorist attacks from 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to the definitive data after the trade closure, 199,61 points and set to 1 983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,5 points.
Since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally fell through an unexpected refusal plan to rescue the bank of the Snowmen, a plan to enable the market to find some stability.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to give the Secretary of Treasury to Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
Two Republicans of three rejected his plan.
“It is a bad signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is unable to adopt a certain plan,” said Lindsay Piegzaová from FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market was relying on this plan,” she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days would not be too late -
‘If this project is effectively sentenced to destruction (...), the staphfet will immediately be handed over to Fed (American central bank, red.), and to other central banks in order to bless the crisis, which would increase credit conditions more,’ pointed out Brian Bethune, the head of the global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that every new day, in the United States, is the fall of one financial institution.
After Washington Mutual's Friday check, the authorities organized the purchase of bank activities of Wachov's rival Citigroup bank.
In Europe, the crisis was suddenly reversed, and it requested urgent intervention in favour of the Bank in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which suggests that markets are not affected by the US crisis, but with the crisis of the world, it has added analysts from the FTN Financial.
The market with the bonds has increased strongly.
The income from cash vouchers for 10 years fell to 3,632% compared to 3,827% on Friday night, return on 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4.357 % of the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House followed a debate on the second one whose task was to find out who won the two John McCain and Barack Obama.
Head states of the Republican and Democrats campaign didn't surprise when they both announced their victory in the television duel that followed the third of American families.
The political analyst David Gergen considers that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not sufficiently brilliant - to allow him to stop, five weeks before the Presidential elections, to fall in the surveys.
Galloup's constitution, whose public opinion survey, published on Saturday, condemns Obama's five-point drive (49% against 44 % for McCain), judges that the democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that are currently concerned, Obama is the winner for 39% of the questions, while, according to the CBS survey, 25 % is imputing McCain's victory.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday by means of the expected good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time one public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It is gifted, however, that he pointed out Bill Clinton's weekend.
Seventeen McCain systematically highlighted his insurmountable experience in the foreign policy field, while stressing the “navitu” of his opponents on issues that formed the core of the first clash.
“The Senator Obama did not seem to understand that the repeated accusations sounded.
“I don’t think Senator Obama would have sufficient experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
In such an attack spirit, they haven't heard from yesterday's Republican TV spots.
Obama pointed out, on the other hand, that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be short and precise.
He raised his ability to take the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still did not understand, while Obama did,” noted the democratic spot that the Republican estimated that it did not take sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on the “current American” on weekend.
During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” said Obama yesterday before 20,000 people gathered in the pre-election of North Carolina for the rain.
He did not even speak the words as a “central class,” or “working”, the financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider to be more qualified to save the economy on the edge of the gap.
“The last week could be a decisive coup,” estimates Charles Schumer's powerful democratic senator yesterday.
The democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, former Member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's-Economic persuasion to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the democratic candidate, the current disaster is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as George Bush operated, and how Senator McCain supported it.
The Senator of Illinois once again confirmed that, despite the unexpected jumps of Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the tax of 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the national potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy resources is its priority number one, together with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions concerning the financing plan of EUR 700 billion (EUR 770 billion) that the Congress adopted last night and which is highly unpopular.
“What you have noticed is that some choices were held in Minsk -
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians were gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the election rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregular elections to Parliament.
Although no results have been reported yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukasnek’s regime: ‘dictator, demisis’
Some admit that they did not even go to the elections: “What would it be if they did what they wanted to do with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has acted friendlyly towards foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to take a turn towards democracy.
The penalties included in the visa ban for 40 Belarusianheads and the freezing of certain assets could be cancelled if the elections are considered to be net.
According to the opposition, it wasn't like that.
“We were held away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the recalculation of voices,” Juri Potěmkin, spokesperson of the Union of democratic forces, the diverse group of twelve sides.
“It is a cosmetic change,” notes Alexander Milinkievic, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, and the leadership personality of the pro-European movement, “because it is important who is counting votes, and it is powerful in us.
If any opposition Members get to Parliament, they will be appointed and not elected.
However, their entry to Parliament can mean space on television, a meeting in regions and legislative proposals -
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political operation, as dialogue with the European Union is needed.
If our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis, and we are not reformed, we are at risk of becoming the Protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the course of elections, has not declared its choice valid.
It stresses that participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of an early vote (26 % of the voters in Minsk) opened the way for all possible manipulations.
“What you have noticed is that there has been some election,” says the Social-democratic Leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no foot in the election rooms.
And in Parliament there will be a maximum of five opposition Members, those who are most in line with the regime,
The night silence again became a zejnové náměstě.
On television, President Lukasnko and members of the central election committee congratulate each other on success.
Interview - Blood that's certain again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and effective suppliers of blood in the world.
First of all, he regained the confidence of the public, which was seriously shaken after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Department of Transfusion of Canadian Red Cross has been contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) in the 1980s and with hepatitis C virus.
In the light of this drama and the wave of the public, the Canadian Government began in February 1994 a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster would not be repeated.
While Judge Krever lost his report, some provinces put a committee in progress to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee held this role.
After Gélineau and Krever's report two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, who was supposed to operate Quebec, and Canada's blood company for supplying all provinces and both territories.
When Héma-Québec began his activities in 1998, nearly 38 % of people had confidence in the québec blood system, remembers Dr. Décary.
- The situation was depressing.
In order to increase the safety of blood products and permanent work in this area over the following years, we have regained the confidence of the public, - says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008, Héma-Quebeka has already trusted 94% of the québeck population.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that “trust is very fragile“
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the principle of obesity.
“We have seen many cases of insane cows in Europe, new variants of diseases called Creutzfeldt-Jakoob’s disease,” reports a woman who has led society since its establishment in 1998.
We didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
Therefore, one of the basic recommendations of Kreverere and Gélineau’s reports, according to which, when we do not know and when it is at stake in the spread of serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakobo’s disease, which is characterised by degeneration of the brain which is inevitably leading to death, must be taken by the elimination measures.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was demonstrated safely that this disease was being transmitted.
So this episode has shown us to stick to the principle of caution made sense--
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the donor blood to reveal directly the presence of the virus itself and not the presence of antibodies on which tests used previously were based.
The NAT tests have enabled the deaf period to be reduced between the time of the patient’s infection and the moment when our blood techniques can be exposed to the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We managed to shorten this period for less than a week.
Thus, we have reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without losing it.
This improvement made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of receiving HIV contaminated blood is now one of the 12 million people exposed.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first HIV transfer case appears via the blood product.
I believe that today we can have or prescribe blood transfusions needed to heal,” says Héma-Quebek's chief of charge.
The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of illuminating element can appear in the system.
Just last year, the Chiungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, transfers into the blood by stabging insects.
Dr. Décary continues to be careful and stresses that, in addition to safe supply, Héma-Quebec must also count on supplying sufficient.
“The needs are growing because the population is ageing.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The population's ageing also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which consists of only 3% of the Québeans allowed to give donations on average.
Every healthy person aged at least 18 years, corresponding to the limit criteria, but can only give blood once every 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not on average accepted because, for example, the carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they visited the country where the mud chills are excluded for one year.
“With these 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortcomings are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network must be added in proportion to how old they are and cannot give blood.
However, to convince people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unsatisfied today that we will rarely find an hour to donate blood,” Francine Décary will pop.
With the annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec adds not only blood products but also human tissue, as bone transplants, heart valve, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Héma-Quebek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the pantry cord in Québeka.
The sharp cord that has previously been regarded as biomedician waste spitting blood on stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“For a few weeks, we have celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood sample from the glanding cord to the bank, and we assume that we will take them over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,” explains Dr. Décary, which is described as being very popular in the blood collection program.
“Some moms are disappointed that they do not have access to it,” said Héma-Québec, not having enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all the hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Impact Montréal yesterday at the Sapato Stadium during the second and decisive match of the fourth game played on the total number of goals qualified for the first division of the first division of the USL, thanks to the victory of 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders of Seattle.
The reserveer Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute game.
After two-sided defenseless first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino were added to the remaining two goals of Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan for Sounders.
Let us remind you that on Friday, during the first of the two games, he suffered an Impact at Starfire Complex in Tuquile in the suburb of Seattle defeat 2:1.
Impression measures its forces with Whitecaps from Vancouver in semifinal.
On Saturday night, the Minnnesota settled Thunder in the home match deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, Whitecaps, however, joined the semifinal round with the total number of goals 5:4.
The impact should be met with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Shortly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first three canadien is ready to launch the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kvaleeva, Tomáš Plekance and Andreje Bonescina yesterday night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win the Canadian 3:2 on separate raids.
Kostin, the biggest clash star, shot the goal, the Plekanec gathered two assists and Kvalev cleared one of the summaries in this fourth victory of three-colored games.
Kvalev secured victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
“I’m not ready yet,” explained Russia.
\"I need another game to feel good.\"
“In the first third, he tried to handle too much,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice cheer--
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out that early elections will take place by the end of the year
Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's supplementary elections.
- Remove the limits of our last great northern border: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest yesterday presented in a visible manner at the end of the Québeka Liberal Party in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind his back in some painting mill.
On three spindle canvas, a loop ran with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from a view-Google Maps - maps, etc.
Largest means, just like in the pre-election period.
Finally, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out early elections in autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very charged programme.
“Plán Sever” is the fourth dimension of the revision, which the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of the new economic area, which includes an agreement with France on labour force, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Agreement with Ontario.
Despite the opening of the North Sea to the 49th parallel, the Prime Minister has frequently mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a ‘green with a huge potential’, but did not set a deadline, the amount of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular water plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest's reading, contains ‘nick, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds’
This is twice as big as France is in Quebek.
And he is not only with us, but he is in us,” he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a certain national founder myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, he raised the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Québeck engineering, James' cove.
“It’s our future,” he added after he was aatrical silence to see a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, which was always requested, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
“It is one of the traditional attitudes that have repeated all the governments of the past.
There is one border line that has not been mentioned for a long time, and if an opportunity arises, in the name of the government, this position will be taken again,” he said.
Otherwise, in the context of climate change, it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North - said when he spoke about the Northwest transition, which, as a result of the freezing, opens up all year round.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that it becomes a duty to take the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Québian government would be very careful with them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (an ex-Pequistian MP from Ungava), have already opened negotiations with about thirty communities.
The Interminister Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, has an important position in which Julie Bouletová (Truce and natural resources).
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when a common vision will be drawn up.
The development of the North should ultimately take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly, - promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a fluent vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
We have changed our thinking to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This was the last of the constantly shaking themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail, which was the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests the baptism of Beauharnois' headquarters at Adélard-Godbout's dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, via Lesage, who conducted the peaceful revolution and the birth of water electricity, to Bourass, who created James’ cove, managed to create the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely to the program -Roads to the North - John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When the line came to the Eastmain-Ruper dam dam, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
“I only say it between us, but I plan to be on it,” said his Member State base, calling a great deal of attention.
The same Prime Minister, who in April said that they would not be able to vote in 2008, and undoubtedly in 2009, did not rule out the possibility to make elections in the autumn of this year, which allows him the law.
However, he pointed out that his programme was charged, especially mission to the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention provided a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain measures to change the constitution - which have passed very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal side of Québek) calls for particular recognition -specificity of Québek - in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint part of the Canadian Council for Radio and TV broadcasting, who should have the right to a vet in the case of decisions adopted in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted sceptically in its main features.
Chief PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois has again pulled out the development policy of the north of Quebec, which Landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it ceased to implement this policy.
If she were to stick to it, we would continue today,\" noted Marois alongside her candidates at Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) François Mercure.
ADQ said she would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
“We wish it not to be a simple theatre,” explained Sébastien Proulx, a leader representing Maria Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - Disappeared Countries
It was Vic Toews, exminister of justice, (ó ironie) in the Harper cabin, who allowed to say about Louise Arbour in the summer of last year, that it was for Canada-hanbu.
This is how a woman who has led to an unscrupulous fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration tells us a lot about the prime minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us, which, as the only one in all Western countries involved, has not taken back to the country of its national member who has been locked up in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even matter that at a time when the actions that he had been attacked were Omar Khadr a young adolescent.
The only government that, although Canada has signed a female convention, is denying its word and leaving it to rot in the nonhuman conditions of a child soldier.
The only one that relys on the parody of justice to judge the guilt of the defendant.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty international and, in particular, the Association of Canadian lawyers defend the repatriation of Omar Khadra in Canada so that he can look forward to a fair process.
The same government closes its eyes before torture: little cares about the fact that this young man is sometimes psychologically destroyed, and it certainly lasted after so many years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we are currently witnessing a lifeless era of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” the words that Harper and I have so much weight and which from his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to arrest him according to any leader until now the minority government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that proclaims the virtue, the law and the Order: they do not see that this government has broken down what created the reputation and severity of our country.
Hanba is, Mr. Toews, in this meeting, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell's discussions with Barrick Gold
In the edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the powerful vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell’s logic, it confirms that the largest gold producer in the world began to prosecute three authors and poor little publishing for honor insulting, with the aim of calling for a transparent public debate, and requires six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they are not true, especially in the case of prosecution to honor, but by law.
It's no surprise Garver's having this fundamental resolution completely slowed down.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate to bring anyone to a mizin, who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process occurs, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the military of lawyers supported by almost zero pocket of the mining society.
The tactics in these unbalanced fears are often in the ruination of the defendants in order to enforce the merciary proceedings that will seal the mouth of the counterparty and, moreover, send to any person who dares to pay this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had a public opinion on the whole thing.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold is active, there is a debate in Canada under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas and not in the wounds of footwear.
Therefore, it was not enough to open its books, its documentation and to make a genuine debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion, and he refuses petitions and letters to support Noir Canada's authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could ask for a public debate, and also for the same public opinion?
It appears that this word in the vice president's world is only marked by fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they have the right to speak and the Nazis.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or he doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports authors and publisher Noir Canada is mainly because it rejects the brutal methods of the mining society.
The public is ready to question Barrick and assess the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many consider to be the prosecution, in which they are to be arrested by the defendant (in the course of their investigation, the public debate, Barrick, by the way, just gave an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce that they should stop using this term...).
If we forget Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution of the initiated Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of research and the search for truths that are essential for every democratic society.
Overall, it advocates the right to quote trusted resources and to debate facts and interpretations that constitute the basis for intellectual activity itself.
If it is in the country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like rich companies in this world, without being exposed to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be formed if she followed the scientific standards used by Noir Canada authors.
He has a right to answer.
The universal environment that we belong to has already been able to drive debate and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's overkill clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world, this is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would reduce such a type of wrongful prosecution.
Operation to rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and leaders of Congress, both Republican and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement on the biggest rescue economic plan last night since the great crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, as with 700 billion US dollars, must have been approved by the two Chambers of Congress for months.
In particular, it assumes better control of elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure that the public money is paid, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized because of non-payments and also the right to monitor the level of wages paid to the manager of the rescue companies.
The American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi and Republican representatives at the table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation maraton.
“We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets,” declared the representative of Bush’s administration, Henry Paulson.
“All have been done so that real economies and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis that is currently on Wall Street,” explained the democrat.
“This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and the disruption of American everyday life will be enormous,” said the Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have taken place at maximum turnover in fear of the effect of further failure to set investors.
The specified time limit was to open the markets this morning.
Both US President’s candidates were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed themselves in favour of the agreement rather than having forgotten to express their dissatisfaction with the need to address such a country-wide solution.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama added an agreement on certain measures, in particular with a view to enabling the owners of residence, and measures on the wages of the state of work of the protected companies.
“If we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the ineligibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate ourselves on.
However, these measures are necessary,” explained the wave of television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station to vote for the proposed plan, replied: “I would like to see the details, but I hope he will -
“The rough features I have read, [the evidence] that this is about something that we all have to spend and what we will be able to do next.
The choice of inactivity is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The aim of the 700 billion dollar plan is to buy doubtful claims and risk claims and non-taxable assets of US financial institutions for the money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis with the cracking of the real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then moved to another, more extended forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the settlement of banks and financial institutions.
The impact of the first draft agreement last week is on the conscience of the Republican Members.
From the moment the Democrats agreed that, for some, the “toxic” assets of companies having difficulties, the government will only rule but will not buy them, the belief that the unincome situation is being blessed.
In an effort to approximate the conflicting views of Congress, it was accompanied by measures establishing that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if, as a result of the programme, it will have to take over losses for five years.
The new plan calculates the first amount of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
Another 350 billion should approve Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will obtain shares in saved companies which, in the event of profit, will pay him dividends and which he will be able to sell again when it is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the real estate clearance procedures covered by the plan, as well as to set limits for the level of evaluation and compensation paid to the manager of the affected companies.
He would like to be voted in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes were raised against this project both in the Republican and in the democratic camp.
“It is absolutely obvious that Washington does not hear you,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Sněmovna Financial Committee.
- Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, there is no solution to making money on payers.
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen who are nicknamed - the selection of skeptics - presents the whole thing differently, but the same conclusion is being concluded.
“The number of senior professors of economics, among them three carrying Nobel Prizes, has written to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine the way forward,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was again confirmed in Europe that this crisis was a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced part-time nationalization of Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the Belgian Government, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it departed from the purchase of its competitors, which has lost EUR 2 billion (EUR 2 billion) since it lost 2 billion (EUR 2,9 billion) as a result of the risk credit crisis on the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the twenty largest European banks and among the top ten insurance companies.
“We will not lose this money,” said the Dutch Minister of Finance Vouter Boss yesterday.
In return, we get the right to vote in a bank and influence.
And this is exactly what the interns and households can appreciate in today’s uncertain times,
On the other hand, the La Manche channel seems to have launched another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, more than USD 41 billion (75.5 billion) to buy real estate loans.
According to his announcement yesterday, she'll buy branches and clients' accounts from the British bank of Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank to the Northern Rock, which the British Government must be born from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azure eyes has long represented his coffin, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor stand out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes, and no.
He was also separated from the strong category that bore true stars.
But how long it was running!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years on his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinematography.
Less grand than Brando, who was similar and long as he was a rival on the film canvas, Newman was more careful to the actor, for he was fragile, but also the apostle of freedom and the breakup of dramatic conventions.
Smiled blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother who was the origin of the Hungarian.
One of these European roots was born of American dream.
Without an excessive ego, which is the last quality sign.
Because it saw this whole country falling in love with self made man, a fighter in the war in Pacific, injured in battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theaters, television and interest in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racing driver who was second to a 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time as a sex symbol, although he has been a model couple with Joanne Woodward's actress since 1958.
He also leaves the empty places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the habits of his own show-Business, which will remain to a certain extent mysterious forever.
A decent man, in the most noble sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused a twist to the lovers of the film, while his great role competes with the black canvas.
After him, it defilates more than half a century constantly changing American seventh art.
In memory, the charming cowboys from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his fine wife (Elyzabeth Taylor) in Cat on the hot roof, the adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From the less recent past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, unsettled at an advanced age of marriage that failed to meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls have entered history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, poisoned, violent, unforgettable delicacy from Somebody Up There Likes Me (With a sign of hatred) by Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, being taken over after his death, which Newman introduced in 1956 in real knowledge.
Sympathic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
A bitter and revenge-fearing baller player in the awesome The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character in The Color of Money Martin Scorses, which will bring him a single Oscar from seven nominations in 1987.
This face of ever, it was him.
Here he comes.
In his professional career, he competes with various ages.
Young people know it mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from Reggie Dunlop's role, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brother Coen.
His career then concluded the role of the Irish mob in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which were relatively soon left by the craftsman, Newman remained in the business for a long time, although he judged Hollywood with his outbursts, performances and retreats.
The French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it a live challenge of underplaying, to judge that he had pushed too much on the saw in his performance.
For the beautiful Paul Newman whose roles came to be on a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
But the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despair, whose fall and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As director Newman discovered few known aspects of his intimidating sensitivity.
His film Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (under the novel of Canadians Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, offers a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, whom he lost due to overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of shame and sorrow.
His great friend and former associate Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: ‘His presence was my life and his country with better ones.’
Greatness, love for life, such are the main characteristics of the dead actor.
If we forget his legendary career, there's also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, a opponent of Hollywood's fall.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, cookies and other foods, which may have seemed pretty gagous to us.
However, sales gains went to his Foundation account for severe childhood.
Newman is, rather than having himself cultivated with glory, he's been involved in society by the last minute.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following sentences: “Always and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here.
And for us, it was an honor to follow the path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8th, he will begin to fly in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlago and his associates.
The politicians and his associates are, among other crimes, including counterfeiting, accused of fraud, long-term fraud and systematic criminal organisations, resulting from extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutors, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and carried out tasks often with fictional invoices.
The money from the state and the state itself - totalling about 65 million forints - were part of the company's fiatal Ballaldal, partly in the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money obtained in public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which it was not genuine counter-conformity and the commitments received by the association have never been fulfilled.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoice was fake.
These invoices were made from the jozsefvárosian market, a round stamp was produced in Kiskanhalas.
The names on which companies are to produce invoices have been decided, inter alia, on a circular journey along the northern shore of Balaton, to which Istvána Ladose János Zuschlag sent to.
According to his statement, his first name was to see the guesthouses and restaurants.
They requested bills for their consumption, according to which the model was then produced invoices presented in the context of the public competitions described, inter alia, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectfully the capital's self-righteous.
The facts were mostly published by István Lados with his partner Andras ·rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the messages needed to obtain subsidies.
On his “house trip, ” Lados saw one beer.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho hostištički for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
However, so many people would not suddenly come to this facility according to the company's manager's claim.
In the same way, she shared a formal and contentary invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the Foundation entitled Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The guest house in Badacsonytama only had three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet there were a hundred 30 guests on the invoice.
However, they exceeded this even when they put on the documents the company involved in the same hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in which accounting according to information provided to the state representative of documents mentioned in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa did not even define.
Head of the company Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when they called him to the D.A. and showed him invoices, he immediately knew it was fake documents.
-The name of our company and our tax number were at the wrong place at the time -
As he added, in addition to formality, it did not agree that hundreds of people stayed according to the invoice, they had only 11 rooms with no so much capacity.
In addition, food has also been placed on the invoice, while their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The high-end invoice producers did not testify to the fact that the visited Budapest travel agency organizes only foreign travel, and on the cash payment invoice, which did not match the invoicing practice of the company, they considered as a service for the brokering of the journey after Hungary.
Moreover, as has been done during the investigation, VAT has also been included in the document, even though the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union has been released from VAT.
On four documents exposed to Job Jövőért by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. did not agree, inter alia, to the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not subject to the 25 % VAT, but 15 %, while the employees of the hotel were merely invoiced, the invoice produced was written by the hand.
In addition, they destroyed the invoice by stating in one company how it came out of the investigation of state representation, as a road transport activity that the company originally did not carry out on investment advice.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and the 21st associations are invoices. The Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont fake, in addition to formal deviations, was also due to the non-responsible format of invoices and false stamps.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sport camp in Kunfehérto, whose representatives denied that invoices would be issued.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregisiš was at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was fed in it, in liquidation, that is why according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
The facts have been presented consciously.
The second invoicing group consists of those who knew they were supposed to issue a fictional invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Ballaldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of Collab s. r. o. made one of the accused Ludovic Györfi’s claims to issue a fictional account.
Zuschlag and its partners also cooperated with Biogate s. r. o., currently in liquidation, which supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlas and Vörösfenyő companies with approximately five million forints in 2003, with which the actual economic activity was not real.
Even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later redistributed, but the organization already forgot to mention in their documents.
Other groups of invoicing companies belong to those who had ties to the defendant.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was a designated representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Trió s. o., dealing with fuel trading and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
The company exhibited several invoices for the sale of computational techniques in October, November and December 2005 of approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment s. o. since 14 September 2005 in liquidation.
This company was a man from Romania who was supposed to transfer letters to Iván Kubatov in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that, on behalf of the company, he issued invoices to Atlas, Hoppa and Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and himself accepted their countervalue.
In particular, at the request of Ivána Kubatov, Romanian publishers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, neither of the companies worked, according to the defendant because they didn't get a job.
Yet, he was favoured by undertakings because at the request of the co-founded attorney Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their billing, he put up on behalf of companies invoices to Atlas and Y-Generacyó, connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the company Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14,2 million forints.
The State Representation considered that Kubatov came to 10 percent of the amounts contained in invoices and VAT.
To make fictional invoices, this time for the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, a man also used Si-Beri k. t.
The J-Genernció and Šövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals in January 2006 for the competition Mihálye Táncsics (TMA), a publicly beneficial organization of socialist parties.
They received 500 thousand forints, but they did not impose amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to make it clear, the TMA submitted five fiction invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found at home in Arpada Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the selection of part of the defendants, it is likely to describe the course of the production of invoices, as already done at the D.A.
Interestingly, it may be more interesting if he decides to reveal everything to himself the main defendant, János Zuschlag.
His recent statement is not too detailed, and although he has already promised that he will make the whole thing out for several times, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the socialists made an agreement with him, and Zusi will take it.
He could also have been insulted so far, because his request to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely, for the placing in his home prison has not been heard yet.
While perpetrators of economic crimes who have committed much more damage that they have not yet paid for can either walk freely or at least wait for the end of their management in their homes, he has no choice.
Psychology of trumps: why are we spending more money?
With auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to rewind goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this known - and apparently irrational - behavior has managed to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of New York University.
According to their study published in Science, people don't want to stay in eBay auction competition, so they'd rather pay too much price.
The research tried to map this game in the nervous system by means of an experimental auction.
One group of volunteers staked, the second group participated in play auctions, using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) methods examined active areas of the brain of experimental persons.
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing the auction, the important element of which is to poison the other side, they began to work intensively under the brain cortex, called diet.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the “sebemodating” mechanism of the nervous system.
It is therefore possible to explain, according to researchers, to avoid the sharp response of the strike.
To undermining their theory, members of the research team from many economics have carried out a financial cross-section investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups counted against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they came out of the winning game, they'd get 15 more dollars for the reward.
On the contrary, the third group had already received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups consisted of everything in the fact that one was highlighted by the reservations and the other losing.
However, members of the group playing against the probabilities were willing to go higher than they were in the control and the winning group, confirming the hypothesia of neurologists.
The results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
For they have until now explained the phenomena observed during auctions by joy from victory and by avoiding the risk.
When the neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the dispute between these two theories, so that we have now reached the third explanation,” said Andrew Shotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of New York University.
Hepatitis: when to find a doctor?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, then this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death in Hungary.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name of hepatitis is a summary name for the infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there is a lot of similarity, there is a significant inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the originator of the disease and their caused diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the original diseases, spread through two main ways: hepatitis type A and E of digestion equipment (for example, infected with foods, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other viruses of blood and body fluids (sperma, wheat secret, saliva).
Travellers should in any case protect vaccination against virus A and B, there is no anti-C vaccine virus.
Signs of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the use of infected food, usually include nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, a desire to vomiting.
The treatment can take two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people will die worldwide on more serious types of this disease, liver cancer, and liver crisis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected medicine is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver circulation or liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their illness, the originator of the disease destroys the liver cells in an attempt, so the first symptoms will occur in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent, implement regular prescriptions.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had undergone blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and tattoo people.
Currently, the expected worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is expected.
Since the disease can show routine laboratory tests, you should contact your practical physician if you notice any sign of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatmentable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infection and preventing cancer.
September 30th is a world day of hepatitis, which was organised for the first time by organisations representing sick persons worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, to cause it to develop and to the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, so much does it hurt?
According to recent research, faith works in God as a certain analgesic, which could make death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Students from Oxford University performed an interesting experiment, examined how faith in the god of pain affects humans, informed the British daily Telegraph.
As part of the bizaran survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while everyone was watching the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technology of a detailed human brain test, it turns out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for controlling the pain.
Research is the first of the series of research activities involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was fully tested by attaching a sparking instrument to the left hand of the experimental entity, which gave out electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to carefully observe two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary, originating in the 17th century and the Lady with the play of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
Researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would create a certain state of godlyity with the believers, while Da Vinci's image was chosen because they were not very different from the first, and they believed to be a calming impression.
The temptations spent half an hour in the MRI scanner, and during that time, they received the following parts of 20 electrochoics, while separately following the picture with religious or general theme.
Catholics pointed out that they felt safe when they looked at the Virgin Mary, as if they were “beware of them,” and“ calmed down, they filled them with peace. ”
They felt 12 percent less pain when they had Leonard's work before they watched a religious topic.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that such effects can be achieved by means of any strongly impressive image and ateists, just to find the right photograph.
“We need to find a picture that will be very positive, from mother or father’s position,” said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
“Practation of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” added Wright.
After such a great result, it is only a matter of what effect on the control of the pains of believers if they show them some of Leonard's or the painter of a similar calibration.
Would he have known the view of the quality of the Virgin Mary to achieve even better results?
You're what you share.
Google can declare his tenth birthday that people can find him in their pocket at least as well as in heaven above their heads; they know where they were on vacation for what professional examinations are and what they care.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the managers of the company, but it's still not enough.
However, as far as sceptics making parallel with the Orwell dark vision are concerned, there is no clear nature of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated for the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Googl's founders to stick to their original purpose, which he said: \"Let's manage all information in the world.\"
According to the said Googl representative, even after ten years, the company is still standing at the beginning of its work so that it can work with all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions of the type - what I have to do tomorrow - or, in fact, work would be useful for me - such seemingly simple questions will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all internet users well know that during the online search, the search phrase is accurately captured, even from which IP addresses have been sought and on which site the candidates have moved after their search.
With Personalized Search two years ago, users can, for example, keep the history of their surfing, look back at what they were looking for and what they were looking for, then in the long term, to generate findings adapted to them much more directly - on the same logic will also be based on the same logic, through which the system will be based on previously mentioned and maintained preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone sees what I'm dealing with? - They ask the users who are afraid when they look at the Googl data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is at risk, the counteraction does not cause guilt in users of the Internet, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users will not prevent anything.
The most famous example of recent years was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which he provided Google with the Brazilian government information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community websites established by him.
Internet users who are afraid of personal rights, however, could still breathe in May when a company hand in hand with an organisation for the protection of electronic rights of the EDF has successfully proved its truth in an FBI dispute: Google must not be forced in the future to provide any information required by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought for nearly 50 000 web addresses and thousands of search terms which it obtained with the appeal to strengthen the adopted Child Protection Act years ago, yet it failed to get the lists of individual users' search items, respectfully complete lists of websites and key words covering the period of two months.)
Google's view is so intense: it is being stimulated by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and their private lives will be by using Google services, exposed to injury, and are opposed to the revolution that belongs to transnational companies with conservative image.
And so far, the American geek of culture and its wild set-up, gathering around each other enthusiast computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation of big-scales, “corruptions, which are now fringe, unlike his rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as conquerors of the world, as they both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require its users an identification code and does not want money for its application; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs act as much more accessible, more youthful than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that the geoquek understands a very problematic relationship between the Internet and the personal rights that has brought with it just one of the most complex key words of recent years: web 2.0.
For Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, the fact that we deliberately leave behind our tracks and use the communication channels we have available, and although their range is different, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can run a profile directly on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the application of last.fm, recording it sent music, all of which can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendsFed or Blip.fm, besides, he can write a blog on which he will automatically discover his latest photo gallery, which he stores on Flickru or Piccase.
At this point, we can learn about a lot of exemplary cases from which it is emerging: a friend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of common friends will easily figure out who her lucky friend spent the evening with, or may the company fire his worker just because on his blog, he will pour out his honest opinion on the top line: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely overestimated today.
Whoever lives online consists of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic etiquette behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who wants to hide or avoid googlov monopolies has the option (after the Sckm, who uses the Googl search system, but deliberately does not leave traces).
For example, a small number of people are not regularly registered on community sites to be unable to find them. Online application Googl from text editor to photoeditor and news portal can be replaced by alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not create the best possible profile.
Public opinion does not secretly expect Google to show the teeth.
Business has a current value of 156 billion dollars higher than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel ( $124 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising agencies and services are seriously intimidating the life of Microsoft as well as numerous other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints that act as a calming impression: for example, the main leadership has completely rejected employees’ protests after raising two times the fee for corporate school, any frequent daily meal of employees was too expensive according to the company's management, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google has fallen forward to the Chinese government in 2006, and in the sense of their agreement every finding that is attributable to good taste, respectable interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never pre-introductions new services, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be avoided by the world in new places: whereas some believe that the Googl project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such dimensions that the company will soon have to do with the American Supreme Court, others are scaring its Health system, because we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database, then can serve as a good starting material, even for the next generation of writers sci-fi, the famous amendment of Cory Doctorowa -Scizud describes the future with orwell reminances, in which it can be closely approached by humans only using Google data.
Double killer from Ozda helped eliminate the traces of two youths
Two juveniles heard the police in the case of double homicide in Ozda, according to a reasonable suspicion, helped to eliminate the crime, told the Chief Chief of Police Police Department for Borsod on Tuesday.
Those who have been suspected of acting and have now been accused of helping a criminal offence.
Both minors, according to the information from MTI, are being prosecuted free.
Helping a criminal offence is punishing me by depriving freedom for up to 5 years.
Suspect of double murder in Ozda, 23-year-old man here, was taken to temporary custody on Sunday.
He's a criminal suspect in advance of a multiple murder planned for late.
During the investigation it appeared that a 23-year-old young man owed 53 years more amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so his creditor evicted the late Wednesday into one establishment in Ozda, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man prepared for the crime scene in advance, which also shows that the murder was committed by a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police in the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a hundred percent share of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, even though the Czech Warsaw Stock Exchange had already excluded from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in several months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poláków represents the highest amount which was offered by interested participants for the Prague stock exchange.
According to Czech letters, the offer of the Vienna Stock Exchange of securities, the transatlantic stock storm Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse has been provided.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic expressed his statement last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the destruction of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts on stock markets at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share followed by the Czech company 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. s. 13,5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of European letters
In their Tuesday comments dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European leaves already resemble the “second September 11”.
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the US President, accused the Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able to encircle his own party in support of the rapidly paid bill, which aims to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which resembled the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about September 2nd.
Also part of the Hungarian press sees a vineyard in Washington.
In his opinion, the newspaper El Mundo brought the world economy to the edge of the collapse of the lack of political leadership there.
The dangers of collapse of the American financial system are constantly growing, which will eventually pay the world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress, it is at risk that Washington will not offer a political instrument to address the crisis.
World economy is hanging in the air - at the moment that one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be forgotten, points to the women's daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a rescue circle to the money institutions and taxpayers can save them from the market.
However, if it collapses as cubes dominates yet another bank, there will be no more money, no more improvisation.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to transfer themselves through their national egoism and unite control over crushed financial markets.
Only on Monday, they received more than 100 billion euros, reminding Vienna Der Standard that, like Americans, they will have to touch deep into the pockets and European taxpayers, more and more real in order to solve the crisis.
The European Union has not been serious about the crisis, which, as a cuns, has not yet been dealt with by the old continent.
“Insurers” do not need to have euro stmiliards right away, but it would be good if they fixed themselves, in which case it is reasonable to touch the money of taxpayers in order to avoid even greater damage.
The intelligent car is immitating the flight of the chameleon
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of preventing collisions if not imitating detectors that occur in the natural world?
For example, at the bee.
The initial strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CATEEC fair, was inspired by engineers from the company Nissan czmelác. It was about how to build a new generation of collision systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan constructed a biometic robot management system of the BR23C type, a robotized miniauto, equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate aim of helping to establish a system that can eliminate any precipitation.
During the flight each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety packaging,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Technology PR and Research and Development.
The important role is played by composite eyes that allow bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions.
In order to copy the function of the composite eye, the engineers were hit by an idea of a laser long way.
It identifies obstacles within up to 2 metres before BR23C in the radiant field of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends an onboard microprocessor a signal that immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing collisions.
The obstacle is captured during a fraction of the second, then the robotized car starts to imitate the movement of the bees and spins to the extent necessary to prevent collisions immediately change direction.
In contrast to any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a totally instinctive way.
“If not, a robot car could not respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, since this technology meets the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety protective packaging within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bees are doing to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than an eye blink.
However, unlike the bee, this movement cannot be directed upward, down or slightly, it can only be bidimensional and only in a direction to turn the wheels.
Instead of endless possibilities, which, when avoiding bees, were offered to bees, were only applied in the case of a robot car to reverse movement, acceleration and slowdown.
BR23C uses lithium-polymeric accumulators which are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, it's important an instinctive, intelligent reaction, not the ability to process, and then data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only to several incoming signals per second.
It does not need to be kept and reacted by intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it still uses only a memory of a size of a few kilobayts.
He doesn't need a giga- or megabayt capacity memory.
This is the first step towards developing technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to the estimate of Nissan, could reach the series of manufactured cars within ten years.
Another possibility of using may constitute a link between the unit and the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the final target after moving in the road.
He's already got a name for a precious child.
The $700 billion rescue law, which is to be divided into several payments and the aim of which is to buy unquality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
Following other negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight of the US Eastern Time, representatives of Congress reached an agreement in several days to debate a rescue package worth $700 billion in total, Reuters told.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the conclusion of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package also supported both the Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said of the outcome of the compromise: “The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken.
The written version of the package was published before opening Asian markets on Sunday 8 hours at the evening of the Washington Time (it did not cause any special rise in storms on Monday at 2am Central European Time).
The 2008 Act on Emergency Economic Stabilisation, which is to be decided on Monday, will first vote the House of Representatives, then be a series of Senates.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then the report on the agreement also welcomed the White House.
“With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and we very much appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy,” said the speaker of Tony Fratto's White House.
The programme nevertheless differs from the original proposal by the Bush administration, in which it was intended to make the purchase of quality securities secured by mortgages a total of 700 billion dollars.
Now it is possible to spend at the first half of the sum of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will purchase securities secured by mortgages that are assessed as poor, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special congregation, a member of which will also be chaired by a federal reserve bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decisions of Congress.
In the sense of law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactics: it may also buy non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, respectably other loans.
The purchase may take place directly and directly within the auction, the competent representatives of the Ministry have communicated.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with a guarantee for the means that poses a cause for concern, which will make the company pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, up to $700 billion, whether it will be an extensive purchase of poor funds, insurance or to prevent systemic risks associated with the collapse of one of the large financial institutions.
“We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to establish the law as soon as it is signed,” he added.
On the contrary, the Heads of Banks who have gotten into trouble and waiting for state aid can count on the government to reduce their distance - which is simply called a gold parachute in the overseas slang -
Their payment will be limited only in certain cases, in addition these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The limitation essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, the tax charge will be imposed on gold parachutes if the bank's directors fail to retire.
In the case of direct redemption of non-quality loans, the government will aggressively step in order to ensure that money for management is not excessive.
It is necessary to add that the existing contract on gold falling does not change, only concerns new contracts, which should be further stimulated to participate in the programme.
\"The first case in American history, when the legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs will be applied,\" commented the provisions of the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Democrats Barney Frank.
Moreover, there will be a state in banks participating in the programme the right to obtain a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as soon as the economy and the saved bank builds on their feet, they can also make money on this transaction.
The draft plan states that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how taxpayers expected losses from the financial sector can be recovered.
On both sides, there were, of course, voices expressing doubt in connection with the plan.
“This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this will not protect the taxpayers’ dollars,” declared the Republican Congressman of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague, from Ohio Mary Kaptur, judged that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street insisted on the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to grow
The domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008, compared to August 2007 by 12,9 percent, the Central Statistical Office announced.

In addition, domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industry increased slightly compared to July, by 0.1 percent.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the furth and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to an intermonth increase in prices in the processing of branish and saddlery products by 4.6 percent, respectively production of footwear by 2.5 percent.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical raw materials have caused a significant monthly price increase in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), the production of electric machinery and apparatus (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sector (0.1 percent).
The prices in the field of paper production and publishing and tobacco activities have not changed.
In other manufacturing industries, we measured price increases in the range of 0,2 - 0.9 percent.
In the production and distribution of electricity, gas and water, which has great weight in the domestic industry, the prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, especially by the gradual effect of the officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in each manufacturing industry, prices increased most in the oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the manufacturing sector, 13.2% could be observed, in the area of the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, then 11 % price increase.
Price reductions occurred in the textiles and textile products (2.5 percent) and the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 percent).
In other manufacturing industries, the price growth rate was between 0,6 and 9,1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry increased by 10.2% over the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
The highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the material asset production sectors was shown in respect of the sector's sector's division in August.
In the consumer goods industries, prices increased by 0.3 percent, in energy producing and further processing sectors, prices have not changed due to the previous month.
The largest price increases in view of the same month of the same year were seen in August 2008 in the working energy sectors (16.8 percent).
In the consumer industries, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, on the contrary, a decline in prices by 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, at 12 months compared to 3.9 percent.
During one month, our domestic payment decreased by 1.7 percent in view of the euro, with a USD of 7.1 percent, compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 percent compared to the euro and a USD of 15.9 percent.
Next year, no visa?
According to Kings Göncz, there is a great hope that the Americk-Majar Agreement on visalessness will enter into force on 12 January, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, it is almost all that matters now, if an electronic system of travel permits is built in time behind the sea, respectful controls,
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not be allowed to enter, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The Hungarian diplomat director has been continuing negotiations today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Condolez Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with the Star Order for the merits of the Republic of Hungary and will lead interviews with advisers for foreign policy Presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the Presidential candidates of both major American parties, have adequately assured themselves of their support for the government package to rescue the bank worth $700 billion, but there are also politicians who demand the demission Minister of Finance.
After a few days' meeting of Congress and administration representatives, it was announced on Sunday morning: the basic agreement on the bank rescue package was concluded.
The financial package aimed at converting the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistent with both candidates who would bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, at the same time, with the first economic question, Obama again gained a certain advantage and McCain's head start, who had secured Sarah Palin's appointment for Vice President's post-President after the Republican convention.
Obama expressed his hope at the Detroit pre-election meeting on Sunday that the 700 billion-dollar package law would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains liabilities relating to consumer protection, which also supports.
“We must act immediately, in response to... your places, savings, the entire industrial sector, the stability of the entire economy is at risk,” he said before the 35th century crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity for McCain's ideas about economics to be called obsolete.
McCain said in an interview provided by the ABC television station: ‘It will all be a little different... but nothing can be done simply is not a road’
As the Republican Senator stated, the draft includes the setting up of a Commission supervising the Minister for Finance and the restriction of the withdrawal for the top leaders on which it lasted.
Obama for the CBS station declared that McCain had no more significant role in the negotiations, he himself was with the minister in everyday contact.
The president of the House of Nancy Pelosi on Sunday said that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill for perhaps on Monday.
Overview of the German language area printing
Right camp is intact, only voters inside it became more self-confidence - so analyses the weaker result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
Haiderovs are ready to rule Austria to prevent red-black coalitions.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the Left German intelligence magazine, Franz Walter in his article entitled ‘Bavor revolution devours his father’s causes of dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the CSU's erosion began a lot before its office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have restored Bavaria for decades - and now they turn away from them just these modern citizens.
The shooting of the season is the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
Debacle wasn't quite surprising for CSU, but on Saturday, the process that could have been foreseen for almost exactly ten years was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time from 50 years below the 50% limit.
This was repeated three years ago during elections to Bundestago in 2005, i.e. in the so often recalled Stoiber period.
The reason for this is the modernisation that CSU has consistently performed in this country and is eating its parents.
The sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at a rate they were very mistaken. Secularization, results of education, residence of the Germans from the east and the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without any consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has visible political consequences.
Right camp is intact, only voters inside it became more self-confidence, more critical, more ludicrous.
It is also clear that, in recent weeks, CSU has been most distant by classical civil layers; people in free profession, workers, individuals with high school education.
CSU's support is already under 40 percent.
Die Presse (Diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Journal is in its article entitled ‘Who, with whom? The Presidents of the parties are kept on the subject of the coalition, devoted to the confused intra-political situation caused by Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP is responsible for mixing SPÖ into its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, greens still don't want to talk about coalitions.
The elections are behind us, now everything is going around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the Presidents did not let themselves look at their cards much.
President SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to deal with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both sides is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in social partnership there is.
The question whether you can imagine the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as vice-president, left Faymann open.
As expressed, Schüssel-Molterer’s course was voted for every fall.
Repeating this course does not take into account.
Molterer responded to a red offer carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition or enters the coalition, it is open on the side, so far, these questions must be discussed definitely inside ÖVP.
President BZÖ Jörg Haider again appeared open to all directions.
\"To prevent the red-black coalitions, we are ready to take out government responsibility,\" said Haider.
Jaroková: It is necessary to break the broken circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Gender Summit, hosted by France, the current President of the state of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz's movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional yearning in her message addressed to the platform, has turned attention to Segregation in Education, as this is one of the most serious unrighteous affected Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society in the field of equal opportunities have been involved in the negotiations.
According to the press offices of the Euro MPs, the Fidesz Jaróková's movement pointed out that, in addition to discrimination occurring in the recruitment of labour force, Romani people are primarily guilty of their low education from the European labour market.
The vast majority of young Roma have no secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of basic education, can only achieve a minor part of their education,
In addition, Jórák stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to confirm these contexts in the broadest circles - among Romani and non-Roman children.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income tax and excise duty they contribute to the national budget.
“The rights of their national citizenship of the European Union need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their non-quality and separate education,” said Lviv Járóková.
According to the MEP, the need for coherence of the European Union with the emphasis on the objective and negotiations to accelerate school deseggregation processes immediately, which is the primary priority to correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
“It is necessary to break the bloated circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to give Roma children the opportunity given by democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe,” Járóková requested.
Everyone is a sign in the European Year of Equal Opportunities - guaranteeing the objective of the European Equality Summit every year since last year's Berlin meeting, to ensure that the Forum supports the achievement of the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, as set out at the level of Europe and the individual Member States.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the servant dua Huber-Beckstein will be decided by the end of October
Despite a shameful election debate, the heads have not yet been down, the debate on personal issues has been overturned by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
The President of Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still stay in their places, the question is, when will this grace last.
The fate of the tandem who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of voices will decide the last October's extraordinary congress weekend.
The members of a highly critical dua have, in any case, heard that they will not lie out of all forces on their posts.
So they tried to calm the angry members of the faction and bases, who, due to the loss of absolute majority, demanded the day after the “barorian vessels” - to carry out personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, yet led by Edmund Stoiber standing on top of her career - gained a Christian-social union of 60.7 percent, now, a year after the knock against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her.
CSU was an 18 percent German GDP producing in Bavaria, with control over 46 years.
While conservatives continue to have a key role in the Southern Federal Land, a high position for Hungarian economies, but in the future they will be forced to coaliate in any way.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is that a member of a close intelligence team that initiates probe negotiations on the possible coalition of the monk government with the liberal FDP, respectably with the right-oriented group of Free Volunteers, will also be the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seefer, who is considered to be a possible Huber successor.
It is an irony of fate that Gabriel Pauli, who used duo Huber-Beckstein to make a rifle, then with an ambitious municipal policy, made a very short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing on stabilizing all their energy.
During the transitional period, Stoiber also played an active role, which until now has been running strings from the background, the former Earth Prime Minister and the former chairman of the CSU called on September 28, the most persistent day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber had a number of eating notes on the CDU address, according to him they would have deserved much greater support from the nurse's side.
The other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as warning for the CDU and Angela Mercel.
After the elections to Bundestago on September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor if the CSU, which played a major role in the national success in 2005, will not somehow build on their feet.
According to the Merkels, which, because of the fiasco, has hardly concealed its disappointment, will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the social democratic crisis continues.
SPD reached 18.6 percent of the weakest outcome since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukašenko:position - 110:0
In Sunday elections, there was not one opposition Member in Belarus.
This can be explained according to Russian welfare observers and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) the illegalities that occurred when counting votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although a 110-member legislative congregation of 10 million countries lacks opposition for a good ten years, opposition associated with the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before the elections yesterday was seriously hoping that Lukasnko, who had left on the basis of changes in the constitution in elections with the discussion course in 2006 and the fourth time to renew his presidential mandate, this time, would allow a number of opposition Members to appear in Parliament.
ODS dropped that way from a previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition's expectations, it was that, in Russia, economicly increasingly dependent Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of constantly cheating Russian gas imports, took the loan and contributed also to the fact that Beltransgaz, the country's own gas pipelines, got into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment, assessed as an anti-democratic Luke and other high-level politicians do not receive entry permits.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE had put emphasis on positive developments in the evaluation of the election campaign and not on shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidate third-party candidates.
However, Monday's OBSE flash report had reservations with the campaign during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially because the opposition cannot be present with the vote.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvement can be felt in the political system: political prisoners were released to freedom, and Minsk is willing to commit themselves to a smaller confrontation with Moscow, when it refuses to recognise Georgia from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with whom it forms Belarus on the paper of the Federal State, considers these two territories to be independent for a month.
“We made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that we began dialogue between Belarus and the EU,” said Alexander Milinkevič.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that it remain as well, even though the only member of the opposition was too slow to release itself into an insignificant parliament.
Looking at the opposition's results, he's rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
“With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, the opposition leaves must be printed in Russia, distribution places obstacles to local authorities, but I can see that the change supports more and more people, even among the elders,” said Milinkevnik, pointing out that Lukashenko’s regime, which considers its greatest success to be the creation of social security, does not consider the right or the most officially supported layer of pensioners.
“For the debt of the country and growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security of the soul of the cemetery will collapse,” says Milinkevič.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian voters valued elections as democratic.
Head of the Community's independent mission of the Sergey Lebedív Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti said that “people do not believe in words, but acts - so the absence of opposition is nothing other than evidence of the collapse of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From now’s breakfast before work -
It is for the first time in the history of Paláce Chigi, which have been introduced by the turning door at the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from now on, this new measure will start against the tainted people, against those who are squeezing and then going to coffee at work time.
The amendment against the leechs was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renata Brunetta and Secretary General Mauri Masi.
\"Returning door\" - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more prevention and more services - specified by the Minister.
The new period of responsibility and transparency will open.
This is reformism: it highlights Brunetta.
We will complete the introduction in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, the choice of turning doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.
On the part of the staff, there were no objections, the General Secretary-General assures: ‘There was no common procedure with workers and cooperation of all--
In short, no breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, \"there is nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 a.m.--
During one conference at a higher education school for public administration
in Rome, the Minister will finally announce that in three months the absence of public staff for sickness decreased by 50%, which means 60 thousand people per year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for Italian public administration to become more efficient
In the last 8-10 years, they have doubled due to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunette's decree in accordance with the applications supported by Codcons.
While the Minister for Public Administration today will present figures on a lower absence at work due to illness, he writes associations to protect consumers, the nation of 'stuffle' continues to grow.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered together to declare war on illegal norms contained in the decree -
There will be protests in particular against the exclusion of benefits to a hospital that depends on activities; the extension of the time in which the sick period can be checked, in which range the inspection visits will be carried out and against other standards included in the new Ministerial Provisions.
Work injury, Napolitano: -Resolute prevention -
Every day in Italy will become 2.500 jobs, three people will die and twenty seven will remain permanent disability.
Inail values confirm that in 2007, we have approximately 1,200 deaths due to accidents.
These values indicate the severity of the evidence that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double death compared to murder.
In order to restore the attention of institutions, social and information resources about this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of the victims of the employment injury determined on the second Sunday in October.
“A worrying date extended to Anmil and these same tragic reports confirm the importance of the security of work,” confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmil, National Association for frozen and invalids for work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the state expresses its living admiration to a constant joint effort to ensure security in jobs, to protect wounded workers, to help the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion.
“The pious 'do' was naturally raised, frankly shared by faces in the face of tragedy, which create tensions in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that, without a doubt, there is also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The number of initiatives put forward in the field of education are particularly important to enable young people facing the world of work to gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up due to its worrying social seriousness, apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed, on his part, how death has resulted from a work accident, creating an absolute critical social status, as it distorts the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state.
However, it does not deny that the number of deaths caused by the accident is as alarming as the alarming - again noted President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We would not want this reduction attempt to lead to less attention, because at the moment the attention has been resolved, there will be a tragedy.
“We believe that they are doing so much generally to stop the injury problem and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is essential, according to our opinion, that Mercandelli stressed - to increase control and inspection, but also to have a stronger impact on the training of workers, right from school age -
\"There is still a need for further effort - in terms of communication and participation in public opinion.
But there is a need for greater sense of responsibility from employers to phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon .
In the end, Mercandelli stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of rights at the compensation envisaged for the victims’ work and the “response of support care” to which the system takes place in recent years.
“The purpose is therefore to return the worker to the guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who harm himself must not depend on the spontaneousity or the granting of time from time to time by the legislator -
MP3 Players accused, displaying hearing risks
Listening for longer volume music time and using portable musical instruments as Mp3 player can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's notice from the European Commission, which, in one official report extended in Brussels, quotes the Committee's opinion on Health Risk Science, which has recently been raised and identified (Csrseri) Eu.
“In this scientific opinion, we read in notes,” states that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years by means of portable musical instruments, more than an hour a day and maintain a high volume device, risk a permanent loss of hearing skills.
“I am concerned that so many young people who use often portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels may unconsciously harm their hearing in an incorrigible way - admits Meglen Kuneva.
From scientific findings, he continues to lead - he results in a clear risk and a rapid response is needed.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage the consumer and publish this information.
We must continue to review existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding so that they become completely effective and keep up with the new technology.
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
“Journal official Eu” has concluded that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will check with the other members and parties who have raised the problem, which measures could possibly be introduced and thus better protect children and young people against noise, whose originator is portable musical instruments and similar equipment,
There is now a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB but concerns about hearing damage that can be caused by overflowing exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to limit these damage very much by looking for solutions to reduce the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, will exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a longer period of time risk permanent loss of hearing.
This problem should relate to 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will leave a free pass to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today, we'll close in March, we'll have the sum in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to workers - The Commission for the future of the capital of Rome - which met in its new seat behind Caracall Spa this morning.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the committee will set up a guide for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will evaluate the analysis and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the “optical stamp” of Campidogli and his councilman Gianni Alemann.
“The Commission is completely independent, and all political, social and cultural ideas are included there - it wants to emphasise Alemanno - it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political decision makers left by the Giunt e General Council.
It's not about any change in function, but it's just trying to have a place to work on a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then it will be dissolved, because this institution has to have an exact time period.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has done for the future of the capital of Rome -
To who accuses the Commission of unnecessaryity given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will say: \"All matters about the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If they are good, as well as the Commission's proposals Attali, and I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Policy is too often spent on everyday problems and on urgencys that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look for longer and further, in a deeper perspective, work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, Mayor Rome wants to stress that ‘this Commission is neither an unnecessary undertaking nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not stand nor the euro and serve to think and involve the best intelligence that the capital has -
For Alemann, essentially, it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, nor a definitive or unstable point in order to allow our city autistic rise at the level it necessarily needs, and to think with a united spirit on its future.’
The future, which sets out the mayor of Rome, will not be limited only to the current municipal border, but will look much further - not only in the optic of the future metropolitan city and its legal statutes of the capital, but also will include the role Rome can and must carry out as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean -
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president--
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in his decisions, demolished the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam,
The attacks against Obama are about to grow when the election date is coming.
One of Miami's ladies wrote on the web: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama, however, has a roughness: he thinks he will get to the highest position of the nation, which all had two governors and five black senators.
In fact, these attacks do not say much -; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have surveys; they all say that Obama will win and with a great lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act by heart and not by brain.
One paper from Mississippi, from the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election booth we know well who gives his voice to America's patriot.
One side of American mentality will come out, which has remained full until the last moment.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves, who to tick if Obama or McCain--
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been pronounced yet, it seems almost certain of the success of a black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eightty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent him home with a kicker in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers and Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq has become for most of Bush's weaknesses.
Whoever comes to Georgia W will have to do a huge task.
The US economic collapses also felt by journalists: in the paper there is an investigation period, and many blame the Internet, the killing of the press.
The EPW Research Center has asked five hundred journalists for their professions and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all the media are pessimistic about their future.
However, questions openly did not say that they were less concerned about credibility.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to be.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis in 2008 is a crisis of the destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to bring together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists in question, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional nuclearism to be changed substantially.
The American journalist is making clear, but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten press releases and executive seniors are convinced that the newspaper is going wrong in national scale.
In the local area, there is an executive group of 65%.
Printed against the beard.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the website goes.
Most publishers experience the way to the Internet, which many look like a ‘killer’ - printing.
“Economic pressure, which the journalists point out, has increased by 79%.
Five hundred journalists said that they would go back to technology in the hope that something good is being done for their journalistics.
The biggest gap in American journalists is among those who run newsrooms, which means leaders, and reporters who work for them.
56% national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values while at local level they fall to 23%.
This has something for someone to do with the “work certainty”
The leaders who think they'll lose jobs within three years are 47% national.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving to 30%.
With regard to the “certain work” regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on daily order.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In such a vast nation like Us, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and the Internet employers often offer what they want, so they take or leave them.
The managers receive almost always huge wages and the editor can earn ten thousand dollars a month off payment of salary and insurance.
As far as permitted, the argumentation is concerned: a number of days after the first year, a number of days after a third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick during one year.
It's just a climate question.
UNIPOL: IN THE REVENUE, DENMARK COPPOL’S GROTTFERRATE
President of the Second Criminal Chamber of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse to submit a business with the real estate of Daniel Coppola, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrats, to the apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in relation to the anti-dumping measures at the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process, he gained his own costs last week release from home prison, which was transformed into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a firm with real estate could change his place of residence from a rural town to a capital city.
According to the court, however, this move (by which he expressed himself as a pm) would allow him to influence his company and to get to the evidence that accused him of doing so.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon has been shown a few days ago when Komora repressentants voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion submitted to the White House: a significant part of Americans was more interested in the punishment of Wall Street than on the rescue of the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is spreading the Republican side, constantly more divided between its old soul East Coast, milder, consistent with federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to the “things of Washington” and the world of finance, particularly in central and south states.
The soul that turned out arrogantly by the vote I spoke about in the beginning.
However, this right thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown: not only in the United States but in the West and perhaps not just here.
As in Usa, and in Europe, this crisis seems to work as an accentuator of the phenomena that have been in the incubation for a long time, which have been in use in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is reactuation, exceptional market recovery, the double category of state power in relation to a certain renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of the banking of financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which they are primarily included in the budget of people and families living in a single country, in a single country.
Which created a political problem at the same time for those who drive it: it means how to answer the problems and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis is economicly world, but politically, almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be significantly out of play or has nothing to add: obvious evidence gave the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot be decided for one common political line.
And so everyone awaits the intervention of the governments of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and mainly the allocation of funds: at the moment we get into distress, only states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And it also owns the necessary means and authorisations to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances, which may never be available to any international organisation to a similar extent.
This new embryo, which the crisis places on a state-national element, is ultimately in complete harmony with the ever greater importance of recent economic progress, which seeks to bring to one factor closely connected with it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically in fact, while we were convinced that we entered the kingdom of the net, increasingly sophisticated technologies, imaterial, while we were convinced that global finances were determined to rule the world, we realized nothing that our future would still have to deal with such little non-material things like water, grain, oil.
All things that would have been said may be transferred from one place to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the border area, the territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler, he certainly has a lot more cards in his sleeve than anyone else is, and who has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, without oil and no water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it's about to predict a break.
Who is talking about territory, state, government, inevitably talking about politics, i.e. leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, there appears to be two controversial phenomena.
On the one hand, knowing that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, an application for someone who can seize the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of discreditation vis-à-vis existing leadership, especially economic, which has proved to be equally inconvenient and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense dissatisfaction: discreditation, indignity, inability, and absence, which seeks to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that it is increasingly expanding in the broad mass of the population’s beliefs than in order to be the same as the ideas of the popular elites so far, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word that the elite has already exceeded its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from the ground, but a strong movement to remove the governing classes and traditional political arrangements is shown in the recent election-fighting or unexpected changes in collective mood in the last and most recent time, since the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of the labourists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps what to do with the victory of right in Italy).
We feel that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more problems to understand, that is to represent, which, not from now on, is created in the deep layers of Western companies and that the economic crisis is once again strengthening, growing, potentially overflowing too much.
Before that, it would be excessive to talk about permanent-mass rebellion».
But I'm sure we can't say it means having a pretty open eyes.
Super adhesive to walk on walls
Overcoming laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes has very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a hundred-gram body stuck on a vertical wall using only 2.5 centimeters stickers.
STUDIUM - American journal Science published the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Acron, Georgia's Technology Institute and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that invented the team of researchers is the development of materials already existing, which use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipe.
«The background of glues can be seen as a series of tubes based as a puzzled pile of spinget» explains Zhongshan Lin Wang from the Georgia Technology Institute in Atlanta.
Scientists inspired the feet of the gecko, covered with microscopes that allow the animal to ensure a perfect slide.
Tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these beaches and at the same time simply stretches off the wall» explains Liming Dai, the researcher of the Department of Engineering of Dayton University.
CHODIT FOR ZDECH? - “This material could be useful as a guide adhesive” will deliver the Liming Dai.
Perhaps, but researchers think about far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because the carbon tubes are heat and electricity conductors.
Another application could relate to air space engineering.
No super heroes for now.
BASIC RESEARCH - University in Berkley, California, is also involved in research of new glues.
In one article, American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scientists presented a glue formed from micro fibers as hair, which themselves cleans from dust by moving around the platform to keep the perfect attraction.
Medicines: Never with juice
Watch out for the jumpy, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their consumption changes in the increase or decreases in efficacy with serious health consequences.
To David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London emphasises the risks of juices both finished and fresh in combination with the use of certain drugs, on the currently 263 national meetizing American Chemical Society in Philadelphia causes new alarms: just one glass of luminaires, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and to put on the health of patients at risk.
Grep juice has already been accused of increasing up to a toxic level of effects of certain anti-arithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
LYS IN RIZIQUAL, she reported it herself to the Italian Medical Agency in the information bulletin two years ago and demolished doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NJEN GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit medicines.
Long list of effects that have been removed by grupefruite and other juices.
From here, Michele Carruba, Head of the Department of Pharmacological Sciences of the State University of Milan: ‘This has mostly been reported immediately to various international and national medical agencies that will eventually arrange and replace information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrations of the medicines you get and if you run into something vague, do not calm yourself, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to clarify» stressed the expert for Ansa.
Nobel for Paul Krugman's economics
Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokhenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms in terms of foreign, economic and political steps of Bush administration.
Several months after the attacks in September 2001, on the days when Enron was stealing, Krugman foretold in one comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of the consequences of the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
The prediction that caused a small melmic, which was calculated for years, but it turned out to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked, with what speed of collapse as Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest, said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a major player, but also a popularist who has a “big aggressive style, especially critical against the exhibits of the Bush liberalist administration”.
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package -anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of release of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production, which aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to more well known Microsoft Office.
After about one year's voluntary work, controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows to the public with various newspapers: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window add more, much more significant, as a compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last standard ISO version.
It is also placed on cooperation with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document also with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, the specific functions of some models are such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF folder into the graphic design and keep the original look of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create documents -PDF hybrids - which resemble Adobe's typical graphing format and have the characteristics of a tabulk processor or a text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programmes: it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts in the change, in the text program one color is assigned to each co-worker for comments to make it clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies also work on the transfer of certain Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should realign the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, added to the English version, which is located on the march from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, it is as usual a package also available for Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent home or at the workplace at the request.
And if the topic of maturity can be a move to expand in households, just on the Open Office business area, the package has a lot of bets, and can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And neither offer training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open a business perspective.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing a replacement Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows working on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and when we consider that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this estimated number can be overcome.
Cohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth doping case.
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is the rakushana Bernhard Kohl, from the team Gerolsteiner, the third classed and winner of the best-class top-class shirt.
The news quoted the pages of the newspaper L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Ceru, Epo third generation, after Italy Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepol and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohl fall into those that have been performed in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the position on Ceru, Rakušan will lose the third place on Tour and will have to face the specified two years of disqualification.
The third generation report confirms the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Association Press that he had already informed about the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26-year-old Rakušan was placed on the stage winner of Spain's Carlos Sastr and American Cadel Evans, also won the top-class T-shirt.
IS ITALY RASIST?
Italy, as a country of migrants, has only turned to the preferred target of immigrants, accepted with opposition.
Does this change the country's beauty to racist people? So it's in one long article New York Times, which dedicated this article to the issue of racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case reveals what the New York Times define by the North Paradox: the northern areas are at the same time those where integration and more work are registered - but also the most powerful anti-EU mentality in the country and the strongest support of North League -
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quoted cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampin and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also the new legislation required by Legou, which seeks to inhibit immigration and facilitates the eviction of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of changing climate in Italy.
A tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: ‘Gorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the State and the Church to work together on the slaughter of racism’
Students with expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The market for renting for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to Sunia's latest research, tenants, rent a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, Florence 700, Naples 650, Rome 600.
“It has already reached such dimensions that the entire layer of students has lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure,” explains Sunia, Laura Mariani, in this city’s great demand for the students, in such a way that it has stimulated the process of rising prices, which also grew on the residents.
In most cases, the offer of rents includes several transfers: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without a limited rent, which is linked to it.
There is a need for an exceptional intervention for Sunji, which could be regulated by the tax revision.
If we look at research details, we will see that in Milan, in Brianza area, there is a need for one bed about 450 euros, for single room it is paid from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) over a medium value 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed on average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologni, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, 250/280 euro is required per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Bologna Piazza) want about €600 per single room, 450 double bed.
The values are slightly lower (€550 per single bed) in zones close to other universities (Ostiens and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per single room of Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there is EUR 300/450 per bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
At Bari, they want 250/350 euros in bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities prices are definitely lower, but they have more impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where it is the most common rental phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally one further anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want after foreign students, compared to Italian.
Good-bye to the old Paradise cinema, the city's ruining historical halls
Kinematographic historical halls are closed to the benefit of Multiplex.
“The baby without cinema is like blind, it's like a face without eyes.
The painting offered by director Giusepp Tornator successfully documentes what is happening in large Italian city centers, as well as rural towns.
The process of reducing cinemas, the birth of large multisales in the suburbs and the following disappearance of monosals in central zones of the city is one of events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of real cultural crime.
The historical places are often overlooked by memories: it is like we lose our friend, the known one with whom we shared a piece of ways and a lot of emotions», the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, the film that he had won the Tornator Oscar 20 years ago, and the great prize of the jury in Cannes, and who told the poetry of one village cinema and sadness because of the way of life that cinema lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the doors of 316 cinemas of traditional tip closed, and the highest account paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torín, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions, Emilia-Romagna is in the first place with the loss of 82 cinema halls followed by Toscanske (44) and Lombardia (41).
And evidence that the first responsible for their passing is the start of multiplex, these three Italian regions, which registered the highest number of new cinema multisales: 195 canvass more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian process has evolved in a rational way” says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, “it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema closes in the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about a lack of funding for operators: the previous state debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would be necessary to support the sector between 16 and 18 million euros per year».
Interestingly, the Bologian case, the first Italian city, which is concerned with the closures and which decided to find the east signature of the protocule between the municipalities and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the standards planned are tax relief steps for operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: the audience will be able to enter the zone with reduced transport and will have special prices to stop and to some parking areas.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore - and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by implementing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Baggeria, the place of my childhood and adulthood, was a spark that convinced me to start -The New Paradiso Cinema - which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I go through the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in the street of Nazionale, where I have shared so many emotions, so that I may not look at the inscriptions blacked with dust, I will turn to the other side».
The link between politics and the Afghan group 'andranghet, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
“The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the election of the City Office according to the interests of the Hungarian Piromali Group -
The charges against the mob in Calabria are against the mayor and vice mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio Da Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, arrested this morning because of external cooperation with the Hungarian organization, are heavy.
In the irons also Giochino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson the lawyer, the appointed chief, who is already accused of committing the crimes of the mafia character, sentenced to the payment of EUR 10 million.
“Ignor all legal and moral standards, as well as sound reason, are writing state officials when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay counsel to the lawyer Piromalli.
In such a way, the Hungarian group would allow judges to officially enter the municipal authorities and make it easier for them to control and manage public administration.
The President of the Kalábrie Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that the ‘other agreements between local institutions and organised crime subcommittees’ are many: ‘There are areas in which the concentration of the mob is stronger than in other places where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'andranghets, heroes, who are still unsuspectivated'.
The arrests from today's morning follow the prison of July last year, which the police have shown that the Moroccan Piromalli group has finally been hit.
Since the end of April last year, the City Council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for this time was the expected link between organised crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of functions in the local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the right center coalition at the moment of dissolution following the narrowest choice in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the release of the council.
He called to the responsibility of the Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him that he had committed everything for political reasons, but the judges in the resolution on detention signed this morning explain that the mob group had even reached so far that she asked for a change in the A3 motorway project.
From other interviews directed against Dal Torriono, she writes public prosecutors, it came out to express the importance of moving the claims of entrepreneurs, representatives of a larger group very close, as is generally known, Piromallim and to adapt the election of public administration to the interests of the Hungarian group.
When the energy comes from the waves, it enters the games of the greats.
It's an endless bed that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and now it's discovered by a large global energy company.
The waves, the currents, the tides, the tides are new sources of unexploitable energy, on which the sight of the colosses such as Chevron, which is now trying to raise his hands on these sources.
The potential to generate energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years and in the 1970s the first oil crisis has intensified its research.
When the oil price decreased around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went aside, but now environmental organisations and new increases in oil prices gave the sector a new impulse.
World Energy Council (ECC) in London in 2007 declared that around 15 percent of global electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the sea wave movement.
This amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
Besides, there are currents and tides and tides.
The giants are attacking.
The company that was incorporated into marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in Northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, there is more and more companies betting on marine energy than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” said the spokesperson of one company, which is connected to the United States’ oil cycle, in Wall Street Journal's economic daily newspapers, and is thinking about how to work together with us.
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the project to be taken into account in the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in the US Alaska that is still heavy for oil and recently President Bush came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, and the so far invested sum, even though they are not in detail known, show an increasing interest by observers.
Technology, it's time to work.
Experts are talking about technology that is still in the beginnings because they don't know what impact the use of marine energy on the environment will be.
For the time being, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, greater use of technologies is needed on the ground.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system fear which are connected between itself.
The force of the wave that moves with the fight up and down is changed by the help of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these fights.
The pressure melts the turbine, which adds power to the generator.
Energy gets to the shore of subsea cables.
For the time being, there are four devices of this type, which are waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could serve for military use.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the shopping centre and parking lot using six pedding turbines in East River New York.
The movement of the water during the tide and the tide causes the rotation of the turbines that this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant has stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations for using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest deserves the potential of flooding and discharge at this point, they say in the Institute for Electric Energy Research.
Although this is an independent factor, the tide and the tide are more predictable than the wind, sun or waves, and thus the fall and more reliable as the energy source.
Just in the energy of the tide and flood states like New York, Maine and Alaska, even with other coastal states already invested $7 and half million in 2008 and foretold investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
