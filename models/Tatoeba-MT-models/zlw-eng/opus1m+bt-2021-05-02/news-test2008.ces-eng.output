Inflation in Europe has jumped because of food
The rapid inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to a constant increase in food prices.
The November price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with 2,6 percent in October registered annual inflation 3.1 percent, announced by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast assumed only 3 percent, told Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emigrant Bank (ECB), the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing together with rising raw materials prices and decreasing unemployment would lead to inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in absurd situations: it must decommission the inflation - so that nothing is required to do later on this matter.
In Germany, November inflation accounts for 3.3 percent of the 15-year record; in Spain it then rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The inflation in the euro area has been frozen up due to the sharp rising prices of food and energy.
The wheat prices increased by 88 percent, including the soy rate reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007, it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and milk products.
The price of oil on the world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month was already one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will fall from 2.1 percent to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months of inflation remains around 3 per cent over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the interest rates immediately twice in 2008.
Galloup sees the government crisis
The Forum of fans of the Fidesz movement has increased significantly to the beginning of December, so it has now been the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of Socialists of the Gallop Institute, it has never measured 13 percent of its support.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 %) support compared to the five MFA support.
The MDF and the SCI are, according to the survey under the Parliament's entry threshold: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among certain voters of the party, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view in the economy has worsened due to the previous minimum - there was never a ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent of the situation is bad.
The families value the change in their material situation after spring and summer prospects now more pessimistically.
As far as next year is concerned, the greater part of the population with further deterioration and only ten with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the questioned were judged, most of all the recent surveys by the Galloup Institute that the Prime Minister performed his work rather badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsany believes or very much believes 13 percent of the questions, while the proportion of supporters is 38 percent for Viktor Orban.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 percent, the President of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One of the indicators for political development is how much part of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without changing governments.
While after last October’s unrest, the government and Prime Minister considered 35 percent desirable, this share is now only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing only the conclusion of the new elections.
For the interest in the referendum, it is evident that 60 percent of the questions asked regarding their possible participation that they would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 percent would have said that they would probably have come.
For comparison, the \"parlamental elections organised this Sunday\" would certainly take part only 55 percent and the next 15 percent consider their participation likely. The failure of the referendum would be questionable on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no 74, the medical fees 79 and the charge for staying at the hospital 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportion only in a range of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of a school fee, doctor fees and residence fees refused 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is the Auchan, almost five times undercut from Tesco.
Hypermarkets in the Budaörse trade triangle maintained last year, on average 16 % price levels increase, with the difference that this year did not increase VAT.
An article on the journal Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of the journal Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörsian business triangle this year increased by 16 percent on average, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase of over 1,000 forints in price.
Given that the prices in food supermarkets have already been selected in December, a percentage has not been shown to be so drastic in view of the earlier high base.
But for the consumer, it is certainly unfortunate that what they could have bought in the last year for the price of under nine thousand forints will not now be able to buy for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the daily economy in examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,533 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumer basket of 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost last year's level, however, they greatly undermined cruel breasts, nuts, and also maces.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found kilogram bread in Auchun for 139 forints.
Competition didn't go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
In the same way, in this shop it was surprising that the price of the Coca Cola in the gate bottle was below 200 forint, so it was also a backup product of only 257 forints.
However, this year he was still the most expensive one according to the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság Auchan, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, she raised prices in a consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság, due to the prices of the last year at Christmas Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan about 18 percent.
When compared to last year's highest and this year's lowest consumer basket value, the difference was 12 percent while rising between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In the forints there was an increase of 1 480 on average.
The average increase in prices last year was 1 206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last year.
This process of trade has spread, trade homes have clearly failed to decide how much price margins are to be determined for each product because they could not predict what effect the price changes will have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the rate of circulation of the product concerned is poor, it may lose significant profit due to the price margin adjusted for circulation.)
Due to the recent increase in the price of the consumer basket, Napi Gazdaság showed so extremely that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while for the cheapest was the price difference of all 844 forints.
This year, there was no extreme difference, the most expensive basket was now 1 630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest one was 1,84 forints.
In comparison to both Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase in less than 20 months below the daily consumption in hypermarkets of more than 30 percent.
(In particular, it does not entirely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured, in the case of several basic foods, the price increase exceeding 30 percent during 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, even in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumer basket of the Daily economy, it seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, has shown, in view of the basis, even in the worst case of price growth, less than 10 percent.
The suppliers of flour seem to be taking a stronger position than egg suppliers, the drastic increase in prices has been done in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a commercial gold triangle do not complain, they still report for a good year.
According to our experience, most customers no longer care about three discounted shops.
They buy all kinds of quantas, grassy foods take after wages.
In the middle of the morning, in all three supermarkets, long queues were formed at the cash register, as the number of visitors grew sharply.
However, as we know in the country, the turnover is lower, many international chains complain about research companies complaining that the sales are also behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also of durable consumer goods.
In many places they save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infections were registered in hospitals due mainly to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, overfilling beds, overload of personnel to stop the disease, states the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places they also save on disinfectants.
Recently, the trauma department of St. John's hospital has been diagnosed with MERSA infection.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics were discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred at the same site early in the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that, he had to return to MSSA infections and because of the bacteria found in his body, one important operation could not yet be performed.
By this 10 December, 1 994 hospital infections caused by multiresist agents of the disease were reported to the National System of Nesocomalis Surveillance, by Karolina Böröcz, the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistent disease origins were registered in hospitals with certainty, others are not aware of.
Almost two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MSSA, or methicilin-oxaciline resistant to gold staphylococcals.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carrying a third of people in their nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. bleeding inflammation, mandles inflammation, skin infections, early infections) have a good reaction to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive degree or inappropriately, they are derived from bacteria that respond well to antibiotics that are highly resistant to antibiotics and which are rapidly spreading rapidly in non-responsible hospital conditions.
First of all, in the case of transient or permanent poor functioning of the immune system in patients with weakened body, low body weight or in years, patients may cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - Sepsis.
According to the Chief Doctor of St. John's Hospital, there's nothing special about the infection of MRSA, similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
“Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MSSA is not only there,” said Tibor Nyulasi, “where the disease agent’s presence is not investigated,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
It resists antibiotics
“We isolate these patients, treat them in rubber gloves and masks, and treat them we have needed antibiotics,” said Tibor Nyulas.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first investigated whether they are present in their MSSA body, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be avoided, but the current rates and conditions in domestic hospitals are not to prevent the emergence and spread of multiresist agents with favorable diseases, according to Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs occasionally in hospitals and senior homes, hospitals receiving patients should check and carryers immediately in isolation.
However, the microbiological samples are not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this examination.
Most of the cases have been revealed if the patient suffers from a post-optimal MRSA infection, she said the primary epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there is also a home directive for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Microbiological examinations should be sought in order to avoid the development of resistance to medicines, but neither do hospitals comply in all cases.
The microbiological samples are even more rare in the basic, respectably ambulatory treatment of patients, told Karolina Böröczová.
Signs on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MSSA spreads among patients most frequently through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but also in hospitals there are serious shortcomings.
MRSA is transmitted by cape infection and touch, but in home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to themselves, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals located in an adverse material situation, they save on disinfectant agents, the nurse is little and the patients much, making the chances of developing infections even worse.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are respected, similar infections are clearly less or can be stopped by another spread of the disease agent.
Government programme against MSSA
Treatment of MSSA infection represents huge expenditure for health insurance companies, which is why there is a fight against it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written an MRA prevention programme, with respect to reducing its occurrence.
As it appears, the program is successful, according to the data published, shows the MRSA infection in England falling tendencies.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) sets out the prevention of the emergence of multiresistent disease agents (including MSSA), respectful hospital infections caused by these disease agents, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused a fatal accident wasn't drunk.
Official expert judgment in the police case of Captain XXII of the district that caused a fatal accident is done.
It can be ruled out that a police officer in the 21I district who died of a walk on Tuesday and which, in the meantime, resigned from his function, was driving under the influence of alcohol or tangible substances, informed the spokesperson of the Vrch State Representation of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert assessment of this case was completed.
The expert assessment confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain before he sat behind the wheel, did not experience any alcohol.
The chief of police headquarters XXII. district ran down on Tuesday in Lajose Kosutha street in XXII. district with its own passenger car when turning a five-year-old man who entered the car in front of him when crossing the marked passage.
(The subsequently appointed fact that the walker went out of the zebra, according to the rules of road traffic is not an easy condition, the turning car must still give priority.)
After transporting the pedestrian to the hospital, he died.
Because of this event, the District Police Director resigned from his office and asked for transfer to the service, according to the police's communication, because he was shocked so much.
In the case of the investigation of Budapest’s State Prosecutor’s investigation.
Attila Morvai mentioned the same fact that the former police captain had cooperated with the state officials conducting the investigation from the outset.
Other EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks worth EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy on Friday in Budapest, the Minister of Finance János Veres and Martha Gajeck, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian budget financing for transport and the environment projects implemented in support of the Cohezní Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with a credit agreement of 100 million already concluded by the parties, now the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Also, a loan agreement of EUR 150 million is used for the budget financing of projects related to education.
The EIB approved Hungary for these purposes in total EUR 300 million, with the use of the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which the budget will mainly apply to the research and development project of the Debrecenian University.
There was also talk about the 4th metro route at the meeting.
The Parties have agreed that, once Hungary has agreed with the EU, the details of the funding of the subway will return to whether and how to modify the original contract.
This can occur according to Jánose Verese in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest of the EIB's loans with an eight-year waiting period and without mandatory commission shall be linked to EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is stunning - the attention of all of Europe is turning to a rather bloated Balkan country earlier.
What, where and who is buying on the cheapest yet, but with a rapidly betraying EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought Eastern European goal of real estate purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the mountains are the most in the course of Bansko, Borec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albana, Gold Sands, Sun Coast, ancient cities Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balčík.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, investors and the central part of the country will be raised sooner or later - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and increasingly interested in buying around the cheap city of Russia.
Also the capital of Sofia is the promise of appealing possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to change in one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, and to become so next to the summer and winter seasons sought for travel in the next two seasons.
The ancient investors are so already buying in large, for example in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their life and lifestyle.
The largest customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania are also coming.
There are also Maltese and Cyprus investors, at the Black Sea, and in ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers should be divided into three groups, says Georgia Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or lost old homes for EUR 5-15 000, which are then renovating.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to be close to large cities, shops and, as a general rule, to the local physician.
The second categories are chat buyers (Bulgaria in December ranked among the first 10 German recreational targets).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in hope of rising values in the medium to long term.
Real estate fraud in the capital is constant, as demand is getting stronger.
While the lowest prices are in Bulgaria in the European Union, they have grown by 21 percent annually in the last five years.
Real estate price increases significantly.
Fodor and Hungarian 6 percent
According to the information provided by the Minister for the Environment and Water Management Gábora Fodora, a meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and, after the Wednesday official launch, the international conference on the climate regime will continue to be held by ministers after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are acting on a Travel Map from Bali, addressing efforts following the emissions reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force by 2012.
At this moment, there is a stormy debate between developing and advanced countries.
The United States also announced that they do not wish to deal with accurate numbers now, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 in view of the 1990 state.
Another big issue of the conference is whether the developed country will join, in addition to reducing emissions, both material and technological assistance to countries that are exposed to it.
The Agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set up by the Kyoto Protocol, will be given to the 16-member board, probably within the framework of the World Environmental Protection Programme (EGF) at the UN - can be read in the Piac és Profit magazine.
Hungarian 6 percent
The Minister for Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in efforts to protect global climate and to help develop a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU undertakes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the adoption of the agreement after 2012 - and is prepared to commit to a reduction of up to 30% if other developed world areas, respectably developed countries are willing to take responsibility and commitments corresponding to their option.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 have met the target of a reduction of 5.2 percent, while the 15 EU Member States have committed themselves to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfil. - it is recalled in the press report of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is about a lot, because in two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would have moved up to 2012. In such a case, the obligation to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately bind a new emission reduction system, on which necessity in its latest report was also explained by the UN International Climate Change Scientific Board - IPCC, which is the holder of Nobel Peace Price.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsia, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting YouTube
British military units publish records from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they popularize themselves, on a server for sharing videos.
At first YouTube liked the British Air Force (RAF): Special Units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from the Taliban actions since March 2006 and have notified the BBC.
Recordings, controlled by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the command of air force control operations in the Kandahar area and then sent to London, where they are transmitted online.
The political message is inevitable
This form has already reached 139 recordings of British air force soldiers and on their “channel” - looked at more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as a ‘defenceheadquarters’ and publishes recordings from the events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Implementation in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original intention for recruitment and, according to the Ministry of Defence, are good also to familiarise the general public with the real aim of the presence of the military abroad.
“Propagation published in this form almost nothing is worth compared to traditional television recruitment ads,” said the BBC expert on the defence of Gordon Mackenzie, “but it also has a political message in itself, because the special form confirms the legitimacy of military actions that the government has decided to do,”
The Americans have made a game
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully prepared, censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, which captures both soldiers' death: in a bit of hypocritical, “optional” film, because officers at most talk about losses, but does not appear to be bloodlike fighting.
On the Internet, there have been many videos of the fights in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the sharp deployment, but the British army has come to them until now.
Americans do recruit a little differently - using shooting games called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through more or less loyal simulations.
There will be Christmas at the Ministry with tombola and nails
Mónika Lamperth's job is probably not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he will arrange for his coworkers a final work meeting, where the spiders and coffees will be part of the year 2007.
There will be a live music party at some ministers, and others will be bitten by officials of the Christmas atmosphere tombolo and toast.
Evening, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most basic Ministerial Christmas party this year, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas, orphans get gifts of the children of fallen soldiers, during the Missionary Christmas, they will host family members of soldiers, serving at the moment at foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere of the end of 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will throw away from the other resorts.
The GKM party is organized in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and six hundred staff of the Ministry are expected to have approximately three hundred fifty guests.
The Resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and there will also be a toll.
Christmas NFÜ stood 4,700 000 forints and took place in the center of the State Justice Council building (OIT) - there were concerts and dinners on the program.
Renting a hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
One NFÜ department seems to be invited to another Christmas party: this is where a company that organizes the course of tenets, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money is organised.
To this end, they rented a building of the theatre of Wiigszínhích.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to reach the person responsible.
There's no need for the suit.
The OIT building was not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized St. Lucie's dance on 7 December.
However, OIT did not want money from him using her halls.
The prom was attended by five hundred people.
The party started a healthy minister, after dinner, it was possible to dance for the accompanying live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo], the balls were not compulsory for evening dress or suit at all.
The Puritans' party is about to go to health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and a celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in their own building.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth's coworkers don't even officially invite them to a Christmas party, but at the final work meeting.
One hundred and 80 guests are counted who, according to the press release, receive only coffee and nails, so there will only be 350 000 forints at the party.
The Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai will simply join his co-workers in the Aule of the Ministry for Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will arrange a Christmas meeting at which 436 workers are expected to be in their own large hall.
For Christmas party there are 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toasts.
Since Minister János Veres has been celebrating PM Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the victimality will strengthen not only the minister's speech, but also the afternoon running time.
Resort of agriculture is held on January 20th, New Year's reception, Ministerial Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will take place in the castle of Vajdahunyadvár in the City Seats and according to the Ministry's communication, there are 1,000 forints per person for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, where only relevant foreign diplomats are invited to be accredited in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with minor hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture of Christmas parties do not organize at all, communicated to the portal [origo] the relevant press department.
The Christmas celebrations of the resort in the press department were unable to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party at the Ummělekopremy museum.
It goes back to the giant stables
The association of the Liga trade unions, respectfully the National Association of Workers' Councils (MOS), will create their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited slots.
On Saturday, protest public assembly, Monday - on the final day of the vote on the Law on Health Insurance - will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport, because the rail transport will almost completely stop, and by 13 hours the employees of Budapest’s transport company (BKV) will also stop.
On Friday afternoon Liga will meet together with the National Association of Works Councils with details jointly organised Monday strike.
There will also be a LIGA strike committee - MOZ, which will coordinate the Monday event.
On Saturday, a protest public assembly takes place, then the unions joining the strike will stop work for an indeterminate period if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that there was no deadline for termination of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on health insurance.
If Parliament did not adopt the Health Insurance Act in the end, the trade unions will withdraw immediately.
However, if the legislation is voted out, the strike committee will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to Parliament's Monday show, it is also possible that the Law on Health Insurance will vote until late evening or nighttimes.
Due to Monday’s starting strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: the railway will be stopped for an indeterminate period of time, the morning part of Budapest’s public transport can be stopped and more than half of Volán’s company can be stopped.
At the same time, in many places the country will also be able to close half the route.
numerous trade unions and civil organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the site of the League association, joined the call to strike.
Some organisations have seen strike for an indeterminate period, others have reported temporary cessation.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungary’s State Railways (MELL) and the Independent Association of Railway Workers (WDS) could not agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of Christmas holidays, more and more people travel along the railway.
From the beginning of the operation, BKV will take place from the beginning, from 7 to 9 am to Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organised by the Department of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, to 2, respectable 2-8 hours job stopping called for the Department of Education and the Democratic Trade Union of Education.
The Hungarian physicians’ association will take place on a regular basis throughout the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs (EDDZ), belonging to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SEZF), holds a two-hour alert strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League association is that the government withdraw the proposal for a health insurance reform and submit a new concept to the public.
The second requirement is that a new way of counting pensions is gradually committed from next year.
Third, in order to ensure that early retirement for the relevant working areas is provided for the possibility of inclusion in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Association of Railway Workers (WDS) under the Liga trade association does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport relating to railway stations and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungary's throat has increased country risk
The activity of Hungary's gardy, based on the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért movement in August this year, according to Division of Risk Analysis Division, the Political Capital Institute increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
In the context of Hungary's activities, the largest political risk is that, by focusing on the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Romanian population of Hungary, violent ethnic conflicts can be found in the short term.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard political strategy is likely to target this action - it adds a research institution.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: ‘The public discussion on the Roma issue has left representatives of the public life of representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could have opposed the Roma-Majara to the political strategy’
This deepens, distorts normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - judges the institute.
In addition, Hungary's activities under the Research Institute have shown much attention to domestic and foreign media to the extent that Hungary's image abroad has shown, especially in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic adultity.
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radicals and ultra-prave groups, which have become increasingly public since autumn 2006, is that in Hungary, there have been several organisations which have been created themselves known as associations of the national domobras since the summer of 2007.
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming - and armed - the preparedness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the event of a living disaster, assault of the country, breach of order), in addition with a point on the inability of police, military, or states,” he adds.
He also notes: all this is happening in a way that tries to wrap up the various political efforts built on the resistance of society to the politics and sides of the civilian ear.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association is therefore not only to avoid legal failures of the judicial registration, but also to the political strategy.
According to the analysis, Hungary’s activities are also an increasing risk of neighbouring relations.
In the past few months, Hungarian City has pointed out that in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political leaders in some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Muslim policy.
All of this may affect the political stability of the area, - it adds.
According to the research institute, Hungary's gardy is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so it has increased political risks to the area as a whole.
As it writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guards is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the ultrapravical Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
On the background of the formation of the Bulgarian guard there is a mass Roma unrest that came out of one of Sofia's quarters (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used to establish the guard with the aim of the organisation being a national domino --
In the past 17 years, according to her, the ‘citian terror’ occurred in Bulgaria, but the state remained inactive and indifferent, reminding the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative has created a turbulent discussion of the Bulgarian public.
As he further writes, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signalifies the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations that he will create his own City on the sign of resistance.
Since Hungary's activities have been similar with the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will respond to threats similar to that, by setting up their own domobras, we can learn from the risk warnings of the Politic Capital Institute.
At the press release, Attila Juhasz, research director of the Institute of Political Capital: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Institute of Research.
As he said, the risk analysis shall issue each year and if it finds something that might affect the change of risk, they shall inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays are not all free.
In Hungary, days are clearly defined by law and have already become general practice that work days are moving around the holidays, which awaits us in the next year.
There are no single holidays in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national holidays and working rest days.
The working days are mostly related to church holidays or important historical events.
We celebrate the New Year with us: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is working off - for the New Year already so that people can relax after Silvester.
During the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is 15 March celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the memorial day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1st, and November 2s, we remember dead relatives and friends.
Besides, there are two-day holidays in Easter, Letnice and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are rarely due to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after a free holiday.
However, the price for extended weekends is that we remain in the workplace and in school prior Saturdays.
When the day of the festival immediately preceding or following it, we have worked out, it has been established in the special decree of the Minister of Labour for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and to their employed workers, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or in the light of their destination are also working on working days.
This year there will be a change in the working order at the end of the year: life in the country will almost cease from 24 December, since, according to experience, most of the people of the days between Christmas and New Year, they will work in advance - or use a saved holiday.
In the next year, a few of our holidays fall right in the middle of the week, respecting the end of the week, so moving the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holiday work so that the workers can stay at home four days taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that it can be on Friday 2 May the day of rest.
Another transfer is related to the 23rd of October: on Saturday, October 18th will work place Friday 24.
However, the end of the year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, because since December 24, they will have almost a nonstop holiday, even though Silvestr appears on Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can piss off your colleagues.
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies, which we will not notice: all of this is “spires all days in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these minor unpleasantnesss, or you put on gloves and unclear situations that can be angry with others, you'll be deliberately avoiding each other.
Tips.
- I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department, - inform your colleague.
That you missed a raspberry for that?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or he calls the department of marketing and says that the message forgot to pass on (this is less common solution).
Most often, something is solved by one excuse.
Before it comes to embarrassing excuses, it's good to think about what you can prepare for your colleagues an unpleasant moment, and you knowly try to avoid it.
Do you borrow anything that isn't yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than if you get in for some writing, office need or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember wearing a stapler last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on the table of some of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues, otherwise they'll be rightly angry with you that you're gonna get their hands on things.
Don't take cover or adhesive paper from your office because it can be uncomfortable when you get out early, and you're gonna need them right away.
Drinks about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the spreading knocks.
Who, with who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't you know anyone's own messages about their private lives, colleagues!
When some of them share their inner secrets with you, do not neglect his trust!
Lock in what you've heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, nor when others know his things.
Without a reason, do you spell your absence?
If you call your office and appeal to a strong headache you will report your absence because you are not well, or are saying that today you would rather rest, think that your work, the urgent tasks and work that have a certain term will have to be done by someone else.
Take a look at your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work, or that there may be something that you're going to have to stay at home for, say, that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absences until the next day.
Sluting, burning, phoneling
Did you dive to work from which you're being thrown out of the mud of your colleague?
Did you not want to become a witness to a phone conversation that would be better off at all?
Do not disturb your coworkers by mutilating, singing, loud call (in whose head) or ass-assing, constant blemishing, loud dissatisfaction.
This can all be disruptive even when they are not currently being prevented from a project (written, planning, organisation).
Are you accusing others of mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Please don't appeal to any chaos in the office and the louding colleagues!
Admit it, if you were wrong, and someone paid for it, and fix the injury!
Ask yourself how you can fix things, correct negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Warmers and papals: comfortable clothes at home, but not in the office!
Dress up for free time don't take on each other, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in normal clothes - and if that's what your profession requires, nice and elegant!
When you want to meet, you stop being interesting.
Switching to usual morning traffic.
The radio will call a special tune: the sound of the violins to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes the pace and the previous tones colouring is added to bass, then the female congregation joins itself as a real jewel.
There's a song called Wings of Love at the station ant2.
The home music life just hasn't spoiled us with a high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the traffic looks quite different, because you're listening to the new album of Zagar.
The apparitions of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, are slowly changing the image, and although it is again in the fashion of garage rock with its milking into guitars, even home electropop shows that something new under the sun.
Zsager Balaz started in Five-ikostzel and he also played in Yonderboi's band after the end - perhaps because two ducats don't go into one line - he went on his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pops, but he began to penetrate until he was invited to combine film soundtracks (e.g.
film by Ference Töröka-Szezon
His formation, played in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after the magazine van2 included their first album from 2002 between the 50 most important domestic boards and declared the Zagar in Yonderboie for almost one domestic development that could be sold even in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt - in the course - although no one has asked them, if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded to the following: she made a new, better album.
Now released album called Cannot Walk Fly Inside can open new ways for them, although the name itself tries to create a follow-up with the early five-ikostela flights.
It is one verse from the composition of the old band Balazse Zsageger.
A reference to the etherics, flying would be in place, but next to the essential breath of this music, it has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of time - louder guitar, influence rock and roll.
In these songs he presented his singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle at Millnáris Park.
The album also produced one true radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing recently from morning to evening popular music, began to make us a mixed tune of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers - Underground Divas -
So everything's fine (?)
Portal hvg.hu told Balazs Zsageger.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, however, remains what you play, the marginal music?
Balazs Záger: The definition of marginal music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two different casts of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternatives and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only be produced for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can be sourced from honest internal needs.
This spirit also works in the attitude that is accepted, independent of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, mainly from us west, light music has a bigger tradition.
There are only teenagers and 20 people in the concert, but also older.
Many more watch the transformation of light music running around them, because they also consider it part of a contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how many of your music listen?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music with a target, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more often at concerts where it already works with one another, but it is hidden only in the inconclusive changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that when you want to suit the audience, it is no longer interesting from now on.
hvg.hu: Any way to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo, and he built his career rather from us west.
B. Zs.: We actually don't go his way, regardless of the fact that our music is sometimes trying to explain.
We're more of a team player who's relying on the other's musical presence and leaving it to develop.
At first, of course, it was impossible to avoid our work not to match Yonderboia's compositions, for several of us separated from his band and made a different way.
hvg.hu: The song Wings of Love got to the first place in the toplist of the station mr2 Petőfi.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
More popular style, have you consciously opened up the wider layers?
B.Zs.: We had no plan to write a hit that we would sell the album.
There's more in that song.
We thought of her as an album final, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you pick those six singers?
Why is it exactly - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea of building this congregation with a solo music scene with a good voice.
So together this six-member congregation was brought together - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judith Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then shouted at Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that what you've been thinking about, or did the girls make something up on her?
B.Zs.: The composition has long existed in an instrumental version, when the material was gathered on the board, we thought there would be something else needed for this song.
Following the acroords, he led to join the singing party.
I used to sing a tune on him that was later learned by the girls that night.
It all worked out almost for the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember it brought back to life, but of course, there was a need for Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert it seemed that there were girls in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't support their singing.
They were also on the stage in the back.
Is that what you mean?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share solo roles is, on the contrary, intentional.
Even this song is about forgetting our ego, where it belongs, and just letting those wings, wings of love rise.
I wished that this euphoria condition that we felt when that song was born would feel the others.
Hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, actually, even with one, harder pieces appeared rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To the Girls, where he didn't want to work the groov for a long time, then everything was nice to find its place as in some puzzle.
Hvg.hu: Which song of your new record is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's still changing the gigs, even by letting the board go.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Sam.
The traitorous broker risked billions of pricelessness
It's a great defraudant.
Thus, it marks its former employee, Jerome Kerviela, the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the Dutch Commercial Bank.
She lost five billion euros to him.
More likely, Kerviel seems to have been just a big player who wanted to be equal to colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market.
“He is mentally weaker,” he sounded out of his superiors who sent the police to him.
However, according to Kerviel's statement, which the French media brought, for example, Le Monde's diary, was a man who had profits of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he says.
In summer, he managed to make half billion euros for the US crisis.
The occasion was that he felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided by low-income clients or those who had problems paying back in the past, will have problems.
But the impact on the economy was not to have this crisis.
Kerville didn't believe it, and he put it right.
At the end of the year, his profit rose up to EUR 1.6 billion.
“When I made the first half of a billion dollars, I did not know how to announce it,” admits Kerville and adds that he had certainly left nothing for himself.
He admits all over the interrogation that he faked the records so he wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though he started to take a look at the Eurex storm.
Risk was profit
He was afraid he'd find out?
Not really.
“I thought that only a simple fact that I made 1.6 billion dollars for the bank would satisfy them”
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to develop himself in his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $11,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of 90 000 dollars.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
I knew before my first interview in 2005 that they would look at me.
Because of my education and my professional and personal development, he described Kerviel to the investigators.
But shortly after the arrival, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's stock, he made half a billion euros in the London bombings.
And that was a trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make it, we'll let you go.
\"It's like snowballs,\" said the cops.
But the bosses knew about everything, or rather they knew.
“As long as I made money, I welcomed my eyes.
But then the wound came at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to bury it.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work in the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that she lost five billion euros for him.
And how did they find out?
The suspect has become suspected because of his leave.
I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who does not have a vacation is a broker who does not want anyone to look into his records,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government yesterday, representatives of the European Commission signed nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (around CZK 365 billion).
This is about half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will be heading for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the resources the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will host a sum of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to acquire funds for innovative business.
Companies should obtain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the past, drawing money from EU funds is now part of the Czech Republic in the framework of the newly adopted countries among the least successful.
The 20-year sentence for the ex-President of Nicorau confirmed the court
On Thursday, the Board of Appeal confirmed the twenty-year sentence for the former President of Arnold Aleman, sentenced to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud reaching $100 million (at least 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his own fire near the emogarian metropolis.
If the head of this Central American State from 1997 to 2002 comes back behind bars, it's not clear according to the AP agency at this moment.
According to the President of the Board of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on prison officials whether they will let Aleman serve his punishment at home, or he will be put in prison.
Four years ago, Aleman showed that he regularly transferred government money to foreign business accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and the nearest supporters.
Some of these money then ended up in a fund that Aleman set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drawn up by this Government and accepted by a coalition majority without opposition support.
This year he went through with the support of the USSD because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the USSD could not afford his not to come.
Unlike a busy debate before voting on the government, nothing was dramatic this time.
The House of Deputies has been traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, the law has been approved in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Every rule begins and ends with the various chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or doesn't like it.
The budget is a substantial part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
This is more grateful for media, and therefore much more attention is being given to him in the media.
Politicians are much more interesting to the public than hard numbers.
The state budgets in the past social democratic governments suffered three shortcomings, which this one cannot at once resolve for 2008:
The first is a high proportion of the law of compulsory, so-called mandated expenditure, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits which last year approved silent-coalicies - ČSSD and KSCM.
The second is the deficit management as a result of the first failure.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of urban budgets and municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is to deficit the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to the money from the bank's taxes, charges and loans, have gained additional resources for investment, often put out unfaithfully bonds that they have disproportionately owed their city halls.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts by selling shares in energy and other distributed networks that they received from the State of privatisation.
Now they don't have this source.
If we stick only to official and verifying facts, we'll find out that:
Our economy has been going through the rest of the world for several years, as well as the rest of the world, growth phases, constantly boasting the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been more reasonable than our Republic.
It's a huge shame that falls primarily on the old government.
We belong to countries that are, in global terms, at least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been completely enriched in the giant dimensions in recent years.
Even if part of the senseless populistic expenditure, approved this year before the elections, if, in the near future, there is no way to move the limit to retirement and pension reform, then it will actually end any policy in this country and let anyone thus rule.
With a small surplus, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the money to pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the removal of normal expenditure by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments hadn't decided to do what they could in the past ten years.
If we do not want to really happen that the ruling politicians will become officials, then we must be patient and we must add to this not too strong coalition government that realizes that the state can issue only as much as it can to obtain on taxes and charges, peace to prepare other reform laws.
Only those will allow a gradual achievement of the balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight against the crisis on financial markets together.
There will be more than 100 billion dollars on monetary markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank has a interest rate that they are willing to borrow money for.
For example, American Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and another forty will then make the European and Swiss central bank available.
This is the first time after the 11 September attacks, what the central banks of individual states have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is to deal with the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” said Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group in his report.
“Coordinated central bank actions have reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
The central banks must be really worried about what might still be followed when they decided for this procedure,” said the main economy of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks have a difficult access to loans themselves, they will lend drugs to their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with possible effects on economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate that is used to lend money to the interbank market.
This meant that banks still had concerns about mutual lending, even though US central banks, Canada and Britain have reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates,” said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not think that a step in central banks will contribute to a crisis, because they do not solve the basic problem, and that is the fall in the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is most likely to damage developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his views on global warming.
Critics have now taken place at the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he said that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only to the structure of a conference that forms a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also to the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality.
“Debata is completely instructed there, it is only a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President pointed out in presenting his book that her subject was very important to him, which is why she was so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction over the fact that the book appeared in German translation, because, as he said, “I encounter only the caricatures of my views“.
So now the candidates can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he was not an airlogist, he thought he had enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is a academic, able to follow and assess professional discussions, has experience with statistics and is also a nation’s economy.
The main conclusions of the book indicate that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal that there is no consistent view of all scientists that the consequences of these changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not represent a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Moreover, as a person with a totality experience, he considers it unacceptable incitement of unprovoked views to others, which feels to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the questions present that it is not against the fundamental protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefit.
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver didn't have a chance to change 600 thousand people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can request that the authorities be able to issue a new licence to them by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers would be released on the road without a valid licence.
According to the authorities, they haven't changed their licenses, especially those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While the municipality reports a sharp decline in the interest of the driver’s exchange, the authorities in the metropolis are being arrested and the interest in the exchange of the licence increased this week.
The Magistrate takes about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the fronts.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers haven't changed their license.
The issue of a new licence takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for an issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
The motorists who will not be able to exchange the licence until the end of the year and leave on the road without a valid driver will threaten a fine from January.
The province will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But the P.A. can deal with the settlement.
In the case of an administrative surplus, the fine shall be increased to CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, he could have gotten a ticket from the city hall and a man who wasn't going anywhere.
In fact, he could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum thousand-year fines.
According to the spokesperson of the Transport Department Karl Hanzelka, tens of thousands of fines don't threaten anyone.
The driver's license is a document by which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a ID that has to be valid for every man.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their license.
It is sufficient to carry it or send it to the competent municipal office by mail.
At the end of the year, they will cease to pay licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004, will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court has reduced the penalties to detectives associated with Berdych.
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of committing a crime with the David Berdich gang, are going to jail for 13 and ten years.
With its definitive effect, the Prague Supreme Court, which thus reduced their sanctions, one by two years, and one by two years.
Originally, she threatened Detectives of the Prague branch to fight organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal to the Supreme Court against this decision; it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Berdich is also accused in this case, but is only waiting for the first state verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already received penalties in sum over 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the national court recognised, in particular, the participation of 19 guilty people in robbery, and today the main court discussed the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants who had been charged since the beginning of the investigation rejected the fact that this was a conceited bail.
According to the Central Chamber, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, have provided information to criminals from police sources, cover individual robbery and help gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang paid 30 percent to Opava and Horseman.
The prosecution is a criminal activity of a gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery whose victims have suffered serious harm to health, but also the abuse of the power of public agents and illegal arms.
At home examinations, the police discovered illegally crushed guns, blades with steel core, laser angler, or self-fired.
Gang, according to the charge, came a robbery at tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the absence of twenty men in this process, the courts have already recognised the guilt of other Berdich robbery and a number of other people.
Other men from the vicinity of Berdich are still in a different trial before the trial, some bails have not yet been involved in court before the trial.
The main bids have been avoided by Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are staying in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Child change account: 12 million
For the change of children in the birthplace, the lawyer wants the damaged families of Igor Veleb after a Taiwanese hospital amounted to CZK 12 million, plus the court grounds.
For each mother of three million, for his father, two million and a million children.
Hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for every parent.
Therefore, the legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej, was in principle disagree with Veleby's proposal.
“We refuse such a request, it is very high,” he said, after today’s negotiations.
However, in order to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert assessment that the counterparty had made.
Let's see if it's worth it at all.
However, we remain in the view that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone,” he stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of bail, the family from Jabloň wanted every month when she did not raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velech served as a basis for the negotiations on a trained expert assessment, which was prepared by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole for him.
Children's parents, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychology, suffered psychological harm and stress in various stages and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even when they were dealing with regret that the change of newborns did not prevent them.
Women are more likely to cope with the updated trauma that was experienced and with what was going on right now, summed up Veleb's content.
Veronica and Nikol have replaced nurses in the E.R. last December 9th.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková to Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojan to Jabloňov.
Heytman Vysočina Miloš has pushed each of the families of 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of expenditure that they have created by mistake of the quartz hospital that the country is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured for liability in the Czech Republic.
In the event of doubt, they must enter the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request the assistance of the founders.
The courts have so far granted to people a relatively low compensation, the sum was calculated according to the table in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally a million crowns.
The Polish lost the Kingdom of Valash
The Polevka Bolek lost a dispute about the brand of the Kingdom of Valash.
According to Judge Ostravian Regional Court, for the first time, he used the name of the Welsh King, but the project built a long-standing team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The Polish did not participate today.
According to his lawyer, the bail probably doesn't end, and the client will call off.
“The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasiteing Bolka Polevka’s popularity,” said Polevek’s lawyer after the trial.
According to him, all in the words of the Kingdom of Valash will be able to choose actors and comics.
Harabiš has the same opinion.
It's almost a decade's work behind us.
Getting money and making up actions,” he said.
According to him, money is the cause of a dispute.
After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
They want to parasite on our job,” he added.
Luxury business
According to the court's name, the Welsh king used Poland for the first time on his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, this did not depend on the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš lost the idea of the release of the Welsh passports.
From the original recession, the trade and business activity, which Harabis then established the Valaš Kingdom.
In 1997, Polevka agreed to give his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting their farms and theatre performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the Judge also stated that Harabiš was only using the naked idea that Polevka published in the manifold for his business intention.
“Popularity Boleslava Policka of the Valashian Kingdom project has certainly helped,” said the Judge.
But he added that the soulful project was Harabiš and his team, who was intensively devoted to him.
The cooperation of today's disadvantaged parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, they began to gather disputes between Polevíka and Harabiš, which have increased the deployment of Boleslav I., elected to the furth.
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Šulák as the queen of his mother at Harabiš.
In 2002 the Polish woman filed on Harabiš, and his company rejected the action that the court rejected today.
It would be clear to bring Harabiš to the dispute by enticing about the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and dates he still didn't want to reveal.
- We don't want to rush.
It should be like driving kings to Slovakia.
The King should be voted for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polevka can sign in,” said Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudging prejudices
In fact, I've never done much of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the order, management and also the production could be marked as a subprime.
But in the market is now the successor of Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
And the combination called SW is still a little further away, and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained for example of space on the back seats.
It's already a complaint to the end, because the body's combination means there won't be two meters long in this direction.
In the summer of the world
I'm going to go through the interié very quickly so I won't repeat much.
It's a pretty successful design, where I only have an exception to the poor Mediterranean tunnel.
I'd appreciate some more designer inventory here when the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or restraints.
The side direction was also significantly improved against the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, it also feels like an increase in the dimensions of the body.
Then there's a lack of room above the head in the combination.
Courgettes in the trunk
So the main thing about this car is his luggageman.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (and also thanks to the flattened back window) and as a decently stored window.
The deaf places are equipped with restraint rubber, which are an ideal compromise.
They can't stop, they can spread, and they can keep harder objects.
But let's stop together above the volume.
This is according to the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is more than the average value against competition.
But not against the most sold car of this class in the Czech Republic - Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of young-boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is getting a lot of noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a carriage, this value is to be critical.
But if I had to lift up the position, I still have to mention the exact straight floor after the other line back, or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a four-wheel drive with a volume of 1.6 l with a 88 kW power.
And to tell you the truth, that's what 16-year-old family hatchback should look like.
It's quiet, it has a small consumption, and above all it pulls.
If I compare it to a harmful similarity that makes the wickdy as if it's in the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The price tag will be added
Car price isn't human.
However, we must bear in mind that we have tested properly equipped car with spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car is 14 CZK.
Our aggregate costs from CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
Tested Premium equipment will then drop the equipment for another 80 000 CZK on top.
But we still had heads of airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic starters, electric rear window control...
Just a car cost everything 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but you can count on the additional equipment at Faba and you'll get a lot of similar numbers.
So it's not until it's decided for a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
Children from Eastern Europe are added to British schools, which raises concerns about further developments in local education.
The Eastern European integration has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
The British schools even register cases where the disputes between immigrants and the children of the indigenous people are growing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants begin to arise.
Fights, bullys and fights between pupils have also taken place in relations between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham the police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old female female female female irony.
She's being prevented from being insulted by racist abuses.
The police had to interfere with two teenage girls in Slovak immigrants after the attack.
The girls of a man were supposed to have a racist remark and throw stones at him.
When we went home, some boy went up on a bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave it, he leaned on us apples and pears, and then discovered his ass, “she described another unpleasant event for the Times mother of Slovak pupils.
The tensions are both sides.
One of the local settlers even referred to disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a fight for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tight.
In Britain, 70 000 Slovaks are registered here for work.
About 30 thousand Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba's prettiest Caribbean island
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your leave can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or seas, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and olive cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and rulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you can find this in a complete and richer reading.
Only on one island will you find even more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
In Spain, Cuba used to be a fairy tale of their living in America.
Columbus marked her as the most beautiful place that ever looked at the human eye.
Havana became the warehouse and the translation site of treasures that the Spanish broke in America and transferred to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 20th century.
He let him build one of the heads of the American mob Lucky Luciano, because everything that was committed in the United States (in particular for the prohibition), was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were my guest.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, they grew tall houses, along wide boulevards, driving cars, which belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojara.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Media, they left their signatures to the star showbusity and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in Havana Bodeguita.
At the Nacional Hotel bar, you're getting a cocktail as your wish.
And these 50-year-old cult cars are driving around Havana, because once imported gills and phytes in the salty and wet will have been blown down long ago.
Although Havana is, in particular, her oldest part, greatly lost, yet nowhere in the surrounding area is so many wonderful colonial monuments like just there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings so much money, its development has green.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holgín Province, as well as on sharps as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more spot, which is unique in the world and will appreciate it especially by trainers.
Three of the vast plantings were transported to the candy industry after narrow lines of steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are some working machines, whose layers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
Most of Cuba's most famous visitors are missing.
And so about Varader, or Havana, there's no need to be a lot of apart.
Perhaps just to remind you that in the already mentioned Hemingway sitting there is a museum and who likes this writer, he should not miss his visit.
Vinales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vinales Valley in the west of the island.
But it grows out of limestone.
Mogots, limestones, and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and in their cavitys the natural landscape has been caught, which also makes the mounding rocky covered with dense growth.
Valley is a place where you grow perhaps the best Cuban tobacco.
With its final form, you can meet if you visit one of the Havan factory for the production of cigars.
Maybe someone's interesting even that it's the chilic work of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
The ancient city, which was founded in no time after the Spanish colonized the island.
The glory and wealth brought him a slave and sugar store.
Richness moved into the beauty and exhibition of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain of Escambray, is a place so remote that there was no road in the last 50 years, which would connect the country with the rest of the country.
She's been in isolation helping him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing happened, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time than one afternoon, then it's worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity like Playa Ancón beach or the Cukrovar Valley.
In the evening, then, it belongs to Casa de la Música, who is living after dark, and the music in it is enthusiast over the morning.
Baracoa
A city in the east of Cuba some refer to as the prettiest on the island.
This view is influenced by the path itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánama must overcome the high and divided mountains and pass through the nature that human activity has hardly seen.
Cuba's Eastern Expansion has written UNESCO thanks to its unbroken nature on the world heritage list.
They make the best chocolate there, they have a cross in the church (in fact, about a hundred years after Columbia cruise) and from a hill where there is a local castle and El Castillo Hotel today, it is seen several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about Sierra Maestra, about the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, about the Cabaret of Tropican, about the sanctuary of the Cuban patrons of Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, African religions, who confess the offspring of other slaves, many pages could be described about this.
Well, as it's right to say, it's better to see one.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, says Americans
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are affected by the United States by the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Defense Minister Robert Gates, a concrete plan should be drawn up for the next summer.
Missions in Afghanistan do not run according to the idea that they agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of countries that have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to increasing resistance from the Taliban movement today, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through the Defense Minister Robert Gates invited NATO units to do more activity, Great Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
“The army in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the inhabitants themselves to launch further economic and security development,” said the British Defense Minister Des Browne.
90 percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is highest in the last five years according to US military data.
The number of violent events increased by 27 percent last year, in Helmand Southern Province by even 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter in southern territory.
However, according to the United States, allies got to the same limit in the organisation and equipment of units.
In particular, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about specific targets for the next time and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar way, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is little,” said Reuters De Hoop at the end of three days' talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
In recent months, there is also a dispute between the countries involved about whether all all the allies are doing the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized.
-The Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are set up in areas where minimum violence and fighting claims are not as high as those of us in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The British Bulgarian letter Sun this week marked German soldiers as jacks.
-Afghánian divers discovered: Germans play while our boys are fighting, - wrote Sun in material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went against the counter and printed the film of the British unit at the Grogby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will be spent on trillion in 2009
There is a government debt in every Czech Republic over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to the end of September at CZK 842,7 billion.
This year, the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion due to better development of government budget management.
The State debt of the Czech Republic rose to the end of September at CZK 842,7 billion.
In nine months this year, the crown rose by 40,2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, the crown has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed today its data on State debt from the beginning of October.
There is a debt of over 84,000 crowns for every Czech Republic.
For the entire year last year, the state has owed more than 11 billion crowns.
“For the time being, it seems that due to a lower deficit for the next year, we could overcome the bilion of koruna in 2009.
The debt should be between 900 billion and trillion crowns next year,” said iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimír Pikora sees it: “To exceed one trillion we could get through 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could shift to 2010.
But I do not expect this change,” he said.
Debts grow
State debt consists of central government debts and the accumulation of government deficits is mainly incurred.
State debt is financed by cash vouchers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The government’s internal debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion.
The government's foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion crowns to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September, and since June it fell by CZK 13.7 billion.
The average government debt maturity increased to 6.5 years.
The total debt increased by 13 percent annually for the first to third quarter, which is really a lot of how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds where there is an increase of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will deal with what it is dealing with when the pension reform is here, - he commented on the data of Pikor.
Better than expected.
The 2007 state debt financing and management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion due to better development of government budget management.
The amount consists mainly of the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency 13.3 billion crowns, 10-million pension reserve, government bonds financing for CZK 43 billion and loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1.8 billion.
The woman's due to come to the court today in Khartoum for giving her name to a bald bear
The British teacher, tried in Sudan for the offense of Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday night to one of the Charter’s Tribunals and released as her attorney said.
The British woman was accused of leaving six to seven-year-old students to give the name of the Mohamed bear despite any display of the prophet Islam being prohibited.
She's been punished with a punch.
This British four-year-old teacher, acting at the High School Union in Sudan Chartúm, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Swedish Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact already in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to select a name for a class plish bear.
“From the mouth of children, eight names will be named, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says Robert Boulos.
After the vote takes place in the class, 20 of 23 children will eventually choose as the most popular name of Mohammed.
Of course Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: ‘My name is Mohammed’
The bear himself did not have a label with that name, but in the display of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslims Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that might be offensive to any religious belief: “I regret only that she asked children to vote for a name,” he says, “an innocent doubt,”
Such an opinion is shared by many pupils of teachers who describe it as “great attention to their pupils,” and they add that“ never in their class talk about religion. ”
Let us remind you that the first name Mohamed is also the second most frequently given Christian name in Great Britain, in English 14 different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents the way to worship the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them a toy?
Sure, it's an interpretation question.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they failed to agree on the future status of the province.
Finally, failure.
The Serbian and Kosov Albanians ended in Wednesday morning in the Austrian Baden 6th and at the same time the last round of interviews without being able to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
“It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement,” declared the European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that the peace in the field is at stake - and appealed to Belgrade and Priština to ensure that their obligations are peace and are ready for dialogue after the negotiations have ended.
“We do not expect violence at any time, but we go into a difficult period - he added that the situation is evident - that the situation is tight -
The negotiations end on 10 December
Troikas, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, are last carried out in Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian speaking populations, could show itself in a brighter light on the 10th December when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to give their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent the sixth round and the last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, has been entrusted with a new negotiation.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on 10 December.
The Russians, who had previously blocked Kosovo’s independence from the UN Security Council, insist on the negotiations to continue after this deadline.
“The game has been and remains inclined to solve a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Bocan-Charchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only common solution.
The Prime Minister declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide in its favour, independence is prepared to declare unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on widespread autonomy.
“God, we have not reached any agreement,” announced the president of the Fatmir Sejdi, in the Baden Hotel, where this last chance had been negotiated since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of the Kossian Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade was the past that led to murder and deportation.
- Dominium effect -
The Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, considers that the compromise is still being taken into account and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of possible unilaterally declared province independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned with the ‘dominal effect’ in an area still unstable as a result of a war for independence in the 1990s.
However, it does not mean for Serbia, he said that compromise is impossible.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be based solely on the Security Council in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
The Kosovský Parliament will have the last word:
“The Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunice declared only an acceptable solution from the Security Council.
This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began:
Fatmir Sedjiu replied that the last word on status would have a Kosovský Parliament, and added that if there had been a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speaking people, it would have been done after an agreement with the West.
Bush made a deal on Israelis and Palestinians
During the launch of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, American President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed to open the negotiations once and for every 60 years to resolve a conflict between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush's men, he promised to do everything he could to help them close the Marine Treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy the ‘terrorist infrastructure’, and Israel must end with colonial activities, declared Bush and recalled the obligations that they have taken to both sides from the ‘road map’ in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas are aimed at bringing about peace contracts to solve all outstanding questions without exception, including central issues.
This statement includes three questions which are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees forced to conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took note of the words of the American President and stressed that the subsequent negotiations were \"total and thorough - and that it would affect all aspects of the solution, with the mention of \"Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things -\"
Then Olmert, who expressed the view that subsequent negotiations should be direct and continuous, and that it should be assumed that it should be concluded during the course of 2008.
Bush set the end of 2008 as a date for his ‘seeing two states’, Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside one another.
Saudi Arabia declared that it had accepted a commitment from Bush in that sense before she decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for the release of all Arab territories taken for war in 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means “a Christian in the history of the Middle East, particularly because he is fighting against the roots of the conflict and against its central aspects,“ judging Prince Saud in an interview that provided one Arabic speaking diary of Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutors, police officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As it always happens in such small reports from black turkeys, the official version does not match what they say between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French state police (Instion générale de la police nationale, IGPN), police car passed on Sundays shortly after 17 hours of Louis-Michel Street in the village Villiers-le-Bel.
The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on the patrol and it passed 40 to 50 km/hour, while not on the side lights, explains the police source.
Green motorcycle brand Kawasaki, “unregistered, and therefore without authorisation to ride on public communications” (read below), controlled by two young people without helmets, passed by high speeds -
“Motorics hit a police car from the left side after he preferred the right,” said one police officer.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The state of the car (red front, broken front glass, depleted bumpers) is witnessing the sharpness of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givra responded very quickly yesterday morning and announced that IGPN had entrusted with the investigation of the effects of involuntary killing and non-proliferation of persons in danger - which also includes the direction départemale de la sàreté publique du Val-d'Oise (direction of the regional police department Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the police responsible for the accident.
Three witnesses of accidents who were questioned on Sunday evening, according to the constituency, confirmed that the minimother had moved from the left to the left.
Some rice, no doubt caused by the third clipping on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles were sealed until the time the police car managed to close.
The vehicles have been secured and will pass through technical expertise.
There was a autopsy on both victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel among people, the talk about the police leaving the scene quickly without providing two youngsters with the first help.
IGPN had, in all care, to exclude, any serious accusations, at this point.
\"This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more research and with which it is necessary to be very careful,\" said the police source.
Deník - Libération - met with the eyewitness about several moments after the accident.
One of his windows runs directly where the accident happened.
“We are always together with the cousin who is a health nurse at the hospital, running down to try to resurrect them, telling this witness.
There was nothing we could do.
Then he saw a completely frightened police officer.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth one spoke on the phone.
Faced with the rapidly increasing tension and certainty that the youth situation is hopeless, police officers were taken away by their colleagues who had arrived at the scene in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived 20 minutes after the police left.
They also massaged the heart, but in vain.
No one can say the police didn't rush to help youngsters.
These youths were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them,\" pointed out the prosecutor.
The tension in Pakistan grows
Pakistan's police on Monday pushed the first demonstration from the declaration of an exceptional state by General Musharraf, two days before.
In Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers, demonstrating the measures taken in an exceptional state, they were injured with tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, used order force.
The last names responded by stone, hurting several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and hurt the lawyers.
Several of them were supposed to be summoned.
In Islam, the attorneys of the Supreme Court called after the general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of the wave of about five hundred arrests for opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were replaced by roadblocks on Monday morning to prevent meetings.
The next demonstrations were supposed to take place in Multan (cent) and in Peshawar (severage).
On Monday, a movement of lawyers was given support to religious parties gathered in politically strong alliances of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president-inquisited the population to send flowers to the judges who stood up against the exceptional condition, and the garbage to those who had made an oath before Musharabah.
“Musharaf’s promise does not apply--
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was supposed to express his legal re-election of President Musharaf in the indirect presidential election that took place on October 6th.
The President of the Court of First Instance, Mr Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“All we have witnessed is unlawful, unlawful and contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court,” declared the official in The News.
The promise of Parvíze Musaraf to give up military leadership and become civil president, “he will not pay, after the introduction of an exceptional state, announced Deputy Minister of Information of Tariq Azeem on Monday.
It was expected that military uniforms would surrender until 15th November when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Otherwise, the Pakistani government has also turned out in a country of ongoing speculation, according to which the military chief's representative had to order President Musharaf's domestic prison.
More than a third of pregnancy still produces unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanned or expected.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected, presents studies conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined)- State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuvirth Act in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanned or expected.
Different methods of contraceptives, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilisation, still show 5% to 6% of failure rate, estimate Ined.
The law of birth control was only made possible for women between 20 and 44 years from 5% in 1970 to 60%.
Finally, eight births from ten are well planned today.
One pair of five have even been calculated for a month accurately and, if possible, in spring, which is considered the most enjoyable annual period for the birth of a child.
Careful repair of space station
More than seven hours of work in space needed astronaut Scott Parazyski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the distributed solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit to space, which collected records for length, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned and the degree of “cultivity”, which astronauts made for repair.
The difficulties appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ships released the Harmony module, a large rolling unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some sort of landing pier for modules-laboratory.
However, they must be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17-year-old electricity production module through solar panels already located in the IFRS, so that they would anchor at their final station.
After she moved it, the crew began to distribute the 70-meter solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels that spread out like a taping harmonica, as a result of the cable closure, damaged on a surface without a single meter.
The suspension was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who had originally performed a control output on the Discovery ship, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazyński who was selected to go to the end of the robot arm of the ship, assigned to the shoulder of the station, and made a repair.
It is one of the best -spacewalkers - the American Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
High, substantial, very vertebral, has a very worked chest and long arms.
In his 46 years, this original profession was directed by the physician to “oper” the “contained” solar panel.
Having examined the damage in detail, he cut off the defect cable and fixed the damaged site of some sort of firearms.
He helped him with the second “spacewalker” that remained near the capacitor, and also from the inside, other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The designs which he used, namely a mini-hoced insulating device, to prevent electrochoc on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and, after cot, produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazyński waited for the panel to be completely unloaded and then staged its tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts had a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to go back to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
The EADS’s shares will lose a negative impact on the Paris Stock Exchange, after this company operating in the air and defence industry has announced that it will have to spend EUR 1,2 to 1.4 billion in order to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
The EADS has lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21,96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delay resulting from slow ahead of the engine development of the A400M aircraft, which is a condition for the opening flight.
The price for reducing the delay in the delivery of a military freight carrier, declared in October, was estimated to be EUR 1,2 to 1.4 billion, more than a billion for Airbus, notified the parent undertaking of the European construction company EADS.
Due to these costs, the EADS, the next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to report a new view of profit before deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT).
The group also revealed that the new cost estimates correspond to six months delay.
Let us remind you that the EADS production results fell by 86 % in 2006 in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant aircraft A380.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of the aircraft A400M to the French army would provide in October 2009.
Status quo Decision
Sunday elections will take place without anticipation: The Russian majority will elect President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming so, after the end of a very few free election campaigns, its struggle to stability, even for authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the Russian President Vladimir Putin shall communicate to the voters at the public service stations the pre-contracted television message, however, the content of which is kept secret.
He thus acts from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Cremel Party, which apparently celebrates the vast victory.
Last night, when the ambassador of foreign states received, the President wouldn't let anything out of him come out and settle with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite subject during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and wish to be honest, as perhaps the most transparent and most open choice, the choice without the slightest flaw in beauty, he added.
There's no way in the eyes of the opposition.
They condemn the campaign that has been recorded in various pressures.
Gennadij Zjuganov's communist leader says that ‘no such dirty elections have ever taken place or Jelcina’
After the repressions of the demonstrations last weekend, former world champion in Garry Kasparov chess, sentenced to prison for an illegal demonstration, according to his lawyers, continues to ban a visit.
The mentality of Homo svietica remained,
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple, tighter expectations, two more open questions are presented:
- Who will become Putin's successor to the Presidential Office?
Official letter yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates may present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot pursue a third mandate in a row.
However, no followers appear.
- What role Putin will play in March -
Will he be the prime minister?
Or the chief of Parliament's majority and all-powerful side of the united Russia, who chooses the government and president?
Whether or not it will win the whole line in parliamentary elections as well as in the presidential elections.
It's tradition.
“Russom remained the mentality of homo svietica, it is not felt to be the masters of his destiny,” says the sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolaj Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Petěrburg, noted the time-to-date relationship: the civil society has gained, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, delays; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin drew on the paternalist model of the state, which was perfectly accepted by the population, rather than that this new paternism did not lead terror, but some economic well-being was thought to be Maria Lipman of Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians freely give up personal responsibility, which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
- Why think?
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the business world.
Even the Ukrainian elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (from a total of 85 Russian leaders) are governed by local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, the Russians will also not vote for extremists.
The end of Tamary Čeredenko, four-year-old professors: ‘What to think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which are leading the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, open up to the public.
47 million archival documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible only for the purpose of this period, which means individually and nominally, on request of the former victim or its authorised persons.
Eleven countries responsible for the management of archives - among which Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open them to scientists and historians in May.
Given that the ratification process of this agreement by all States is over, the opening took place yesterday.
Civil Information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen enables the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, against the disclosure of these nominal documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the expected homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
Registers of concentration camps or arresters prepared by Gestapo were collected for practical purposes after the war to find a deported or forced work subject to civil citizens, bring evidence of their internationalisation to open the way of compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only limited benefits.
The director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technology Universität said in 2006.
In 2008, the EU and India want to reach free trade agreements.
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion annually.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
In 2008, the European Union and India expect to sign a free trade contract, announced the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, the EU's foreign ministers gave the EU green Commission to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (acords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of countries in South East Asia (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India is already reaching nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, however, India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth trading partner of the EU.
“The Free Trade Agreement is very much overtaken by both economies, and“ Indie gets better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, has specified the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giant together with the change of €47 billion in goods - and the EUR 15 billion in services - said Danièle Smadja this week, the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade has not yet reached its full potential - the EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durarosy.

The English Bank has taken note of its concerns and offered £10 billion in five weeks auction.
On Thursday, the United Kingdom Bank made it clear that it intends to mitigate the current concerns that the conditions on the credit market will again be worse and the offer of £10 billion in the five-week auction for the basic interest rate of 5.75 % has been reported, with an unusually long offer.
The Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of five weeks of open-market operations, in order to make it easier to make sure that the conditions on the financial markets are very negative and that banks are more secure in a way that will ensure their cash position for this period.
The Bank notes that EUR 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time BOE has pumped into the financial market for cash in a five-week operation on the open market.
They normally last a week.
BOE adds in its communication that it remains ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates in the interbank loans at the same level, with its core rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was established at 6,6 %, which is the highest number since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums have been placed on the financial market of the English bank linked to the rates that the banks have rejected since the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations strengthened by the evolution of the libra exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro, many prefer to decide on the sum placed on the financial market of the European Central Bank with lower rates and more secure discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement popuaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with the Socialists' proposals (PS) on purchasing capacity
The UPP and Nouveau Centre have refused to discuss on Thursday the various paragraphs of the Socialist bill on Coupibility, which is equal to the refusal of the text.
On the agenda, the text of the draft law came in the framework of the so-called Socialist-Hunning - (a meeting initiated by individual Members' Club) and contained dozens of measures taken on Tuesday by the Presidency of the PS, which was an increase in the employment premium by 50 %, renewal of the TIPP fluctuating, transport check or rent regulation.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between mostly and opposition, several hours before the television presentation of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchase.
The Head of MEPs of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would re-substitute these proposals in their entirety in the form of an amendment to the draft Finance Act, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations about the fact that C3 Presens in Philadelphia is creating a new festival, he announced this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey in cooperation with the Festival of British organizer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who was inspired by contemporary festival movements in America,” said Charlie Jones of the C3 Billboard.com server.
C3 manufactures the Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is the summer destination of campers.
The festival should take place from August 8 to August 10 at a private farm with 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Director of the festival of the Republic, previously known under the name of Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most recognized festival organizers.
In 1989, the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn joined his portfolio of Leeds Festival, and then the Festival of the Republic founded a Latine Festival in Henham Park in Sufolk in 2006.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also in charge of production, license and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which currently has a capacity of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as a “inspirative event” that he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna are working parallel to giving the region a European style festival event.
“As a market, we chose Philadelphia and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to start a festival in the centre of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
\"However, the city and the Commission were motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, because of the city's current leadership, we're in politics, he's adding Charlie Jones.
“ Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to start a great festival at an exceptional place that will serve the inhabitants of Philadelphia in the final context of this event.
In 2005, C3 Presents increased the Lollapaloosis Festival in the Chicago Grant Park after they appeared at the festival stage by the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The Gross Markets of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both festivals are held in the urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benna festival is held in the countryside, while our festivals are more likely to take place in green sites in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impressions of the rural festival in Europe and the urban after the americk.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Obec Vineland, including mayors, supports the implementation of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
However, the last appointed person refuses to betray the terms of the agreement, says that they are sufficiently beneficial to make it possible to invest in such events and to welcome a festival which he will have, hopefully, a long duration.
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is “big high, similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will take up 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already been sent out invitations, but nothing can be confirmed at the moment the program is only given to the press.
“Vineland will have a rock breath, but it will be beautiful to attract a wide spectrum of viewers,” says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners that received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the recent Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal facing Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself comes against it...
This convincing mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
His mandate is, however, politically demanding, because the Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns -runaway productions -
Is it difficult for the Governor to fall?
\"It needs to be careful, it's an industry that decides where it's going.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will consider the best, he said.
Honba for festivals
For this moment, however, Denise Turcottea is the priority of promoting local film.
She's already started chasing Oscars.
At all festivals of the West Coast, whether it's festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about to introduce québeck films, draw attention to them and ensure that the editors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity on the 30th edition of Mill Valley Film Festival several weeks ago.
In January, he will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival.
Shakespeare hands with the Devil are presented in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month he also introduced four short-term films and four full-time films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will it reach the end of the year at the stock market? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors already have their hands on me in the expectation that traditional maraton will occur at the end of the year.
However, this year experts are not so sure that they will occur.
Bank Banif considers that, from a statistical point of view, a month of December at the storm, a positive course is taking place.
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because there are some doubts in the current context of the markets.
These experts do not expect the storm to move in the last few weeks, and they say that the stock market remains the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the firm income affected by the turnover effect on quality securities, both in long and short sections,
Therefore, they believe that the storm will have a calm pace, not without volatility, - first of all, because there is no known impact of the likely fall in the FED rates (Federal Reserve), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of an incentive to inflationary pressures -
Javier Barrio, Head of Sales of BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that will take place.
“There are not too many reasons to be happy,” assures this expert.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
Yet all experts have no such negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end up with a year closer to 16 000 points thanks to the purchase of portfolios and traditional pension deposits that occur every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, since it considers it to occur early, in the second December week following the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The analyst mentioned does not think that the volatility would affect market direction.
Federico Oluch, Inversis Banco analyst, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and, therefore, we could observe the reflection of the index, developed by the US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis,
Analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree to select titles that will take care of taking Ibex to the new maximum dot.
The Solana of Intermoney confirms that the “letos is a line on strong titles”
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive -
Federico Oluch from Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the growth will go hand in hand with banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves with this maraton if it occurs.
“ACS has been restocking for several months, and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will go the same way,” explains the expert.
Cycle consumption will be first in the last part of the year due to increased sales during Christmas sales.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technologies will also do very well, even though they are not too represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only two cases of falls.
The actual maraton took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year when stock exchange markets ended with a crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 got back 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6,68 %.
We will see whether the year 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (now Ibex has increased by 8,36 % since January) and whether he will succeed in having his maraton at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Bank Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular decided to modernise most of its branches.
Total two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under Popular Max are a major change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish actors, because he is the first group to make such a jump and put on a continuous opening time of their branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, who also has provided several times that he wants to extend the opening hours of his branch, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, he intends to conclude an agreement with the Department of Exclusion opening of 75 % of his branches on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening period by one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience by Popular will be crucial for other stakeholders to join or participate in this initiative, which supports the opening of business periods.
That is exactly the objective of the project that has been set up by Popular bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, trades and shops from selected streets, where there will be a branch opening.
In Spain, the Bank wants to open 200 of these branches in about 18 months, as it is not a new branch, but only a revision of the already existing branches.
For this reason, the bank will modernise branches that already have in the business zones by adapting them to clients' profile in different streets.
This is the extension of the opening time supplemented by a different concept of branch space and a new, more updated design in brighter colors.
The Sales Director of Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not constitute a major investment but a larger staff recruitment since it has been transferred from six employees to branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for the meeting of small and medium-sized enterprises and will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Hungarian branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
The branches were selected in the Madridian streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized migrants, which are operated under the brand Mundocredit, also has a very long opening time and even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer to sell a large range of non-financial products.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telephonic to sell mobiles through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time on the storm doubled the value of her rival Anteny 3
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, the Executive President of Telecinco, his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he stated that the television he manages doubled the value of her rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing made him happy: 'what I am sorry is that it did not happen because we would not rise more, but because we fell less' he said.
And he pointed out that thanks to the weak market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco ended trading by 2.54 % last night.
This profit shifted their losses over the past part of the year to 15,66 %.
Thus, according to Bloomberg's data, this company owned by Mediaset (with 52% capital) is EUR 4,88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which has fallen by 1.52 % yesterday and has decreased by 40,5 % overall since January, has a half value of 2.3,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenou 3 is offered because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market, at what price and how we assess it in the monitoring.\"
Telecinco announced last week that this year, by overcoming billions of gross advertising incomes, will become the first television channel, as Guyeppe Tringali assured, the executive president of Telecinco and Public Space, branch that ensures advertising of the group.
If the data were actually foreseen, this television channel would record an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6 % this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1,6 % (and thus reached 734.4 million) while net income of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the storm is the increased pay out, which has now maintained: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, between its shareholders 100 % of its profits.
Vasil assures that even though it is soon to decide, this coefficient could change after buying 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased the value of 33 % Endemol.
According to analysts, the market in these moments shows some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco's profits, namely 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected increase in revenue from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and 5,5 % in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Anteny 3, 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: it recommends buying both titles mainly on the basis of increased yield for dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates better Telecinco than Anten 3 (continue) because of its 'number of priority' and growth in trade.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it is recommended not to underestimate them, since they face similar threats (continued market and impaired economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFID valid from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that have been concluded today by the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the draft law, the government has submitted a public hearing of the regulations which develop the new law in order to both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties have adequately highlighted the efforts of the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and the detailed regulation of the activities of bodies needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, foresees the modernisation of financial markets and strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation allows financial advice services to be provided to specialised companies, natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial service providers (ESIS), financial advice companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokering offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of operations with financial instruments is extended so that multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems are connected to regulated secondary markets that compete with current stock exchange brokers.
The Act further obliges investment service firms to disseminate information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk settlement methods, and requires a statement of all transactions carried out to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the negotiations at the Trade Commission of Congress, several adjustments have been included, which exist in order to be considered as a ‘subprime’, a financial instrument in view of the high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what occurred in the USA with high risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive was used to determine the functions which can be regarded as bachelors in the field of economics and management 30 years after the royal decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economics.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require CNMV authorisation and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
In November, the Harmonised ISC increased by five decades to 4.1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat and Central European Bank (CEB) policy to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information which is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (the National Statistics Institute) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily match the final data that comes into the knowledge of December 14 of this year.
The ISC will continue to remain at a relatively high level -
The second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs Pedro Solbes stated that the November ISC increase to 4.1% is a temporary number, but he also foretold that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
In any case, the Solbes, in the spheres of Congress, stated that, even if it was not a favorable number, the inflation differential of Spain against the monetary union is still -more or less - the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November was less surprising than the previous month when the government did not count with such a high increase.
“We expected a value of around 4 %,” said the Minister of Economic Affairs for today’s data.
Virginia's planning to make up with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Since Northern Rock reached the crisis in mid-September and had to commit to an emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits fell by more than 50 % to £12 billion (€17.8 billion).
The Bank then managed record deposits worth over £25 billion, which gradually failed in two and a half months, even though the government offered a 100 % guarantee for this money and extended it to the end of the crisis.
The name of the entity will replace its business brand, Virgin Money, needs to obtain around a quarter of the income entered into the British bank in the next three years, so that it can obtain the remaining £18 billion and thus reach a target of 30 billion.
The Group of Magnates Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to reach its purpose.
Bank Northern Rock has identified the offer of a consortium of Virginia, which forms three other companies, as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy this week.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The civil guard today in early mornings held the current mayor of the Municipal City of Totan (from the People's Party) due to his alleged involvement in corruption practices in the construction that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the city council secretary and local police chief were arrested.
José Martínez Andrea replaced Juan Morales in May this year, the current human MP, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to the investigation sources of the Caden SER TV, could be the head of the entire business.
The police continue to monitor the city hall and the building commission and do not rule out further arrests in the next hour.
In addition, he was accused of lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in corruption practices during construction that was revealed at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of Juan Morales, who was examined, arrested in their departure from Morales' residence with important documents associated with corruption.
Moreover, according to the investigation sources, the Morales investigation is subject to the alleged commission selection for its signature of the agreement on construction with the Galician construction company, which has been retrained by 200 hectares of land.
There are eight people in custody at the moment.
Bono accepted the offer from the State of Toledian candidates and, if they win, the President of Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono adopted the offer of Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections in the head of the PSOE candidate charter (Spaenian Socialist Party) in Toledo and, in the event that Socialists win general elections, he became the chairman of Congress.
So this was announced at the press conference by the PSOE Secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after the meeting with Zapater, who took place at noon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The head of the executive offer to the former minister has justified that in political life it is important to count on the best, and Bono is among the best.
He also noted that, yes, it seems that this politician from La Manchy will be the candidate of the Socialist Party at the Presidency of Congress if the Socialists in the next elections win.
Bono would have replaced Manuel Marín as Chairman of Congress, which, on November 15, published his decision not to run in the next general elections and leave his active political career in order to address the fight against climate change in the context of university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister insisted on him constantly to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He also stated that, as well as citizens, they knew who would be Deputy Minister of Economics, if PSOE had won the election, his party wanted a transparent form - to announce who would be chaired by Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes that Sněmovna will change respect and not the supply or the curve, and will feel that it will become more and more like citizens.
“Unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid, where Congress, the President of the Senate, did break down 26 times on one occasion, is not calm and peacefully speaking.
He also expressed commendable words at the address of President Manuel Marín and his good work, and did not want to present himself in his place so that he did not fall short of what his opponents might consider to be a “greatness.”
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to unfamiliar persecution, both those who look at his predictions, and those who prefer other political and social fights, must demonstrate firm coherence.
Moreover, having a movement leader, who is President of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a new treaty with the planet -
This proposal makes it possible to explain why the activity or ineffectiveness of its government has contributed significantly to Spain leading to the failure of the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it makes it as clear as possible to explain to Spain what measures it intends to take to reverse climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by which population habits will need to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective savings, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and pays for saving the planet.
But we can't even wait for that explanation.
Just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, the proposed PSOE (Spaenian Socialist Party), seemed to be so risky to Zapater in terms of choice that he had improved to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so that it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, hess for any real meaning.
Immediate phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the contracts with the planet; this master is so useful for a election campaign that does not speak nor blame, he does not demand anything, but it is the ornament of the possessions and encourages them.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractual party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and Chief of Local Police Totany arrested for suspected corruption practices during construction
As they informed the investigation sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Municipal City of Totan, the people of José Martínez Andrea, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one of the entrepreneurs in hospitality, for suspicions of criminal offences in the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his flat and transported to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located together with a number of policemen who have also established themselves to the Commission for construction and the City Undertaking for the Management of Industrial Lands and Flats.
The three arrests came to six last Mondays in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the requalification of the village of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but were charged with a short trial in the first instance of Totan's city.
Six first arrests were handed over to court today.
According to information sources, the previous Mayor of Totana is being investigated and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament behind the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
In addition, his former wife, owner of real estate offices, registered today in Totana and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital city of the autonomous area.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and businessman from Vega, was arrested in Nigeria (Ponteveder Province), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which payments were paid.
The investigation shall be carried out by a task force in the construction of the operational units of the Civil Guard whose members, except for arrest, have also carried out 11 inspections, mostly in companies, associated with arrests, located in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontewer, Las Rozas (the Madrid province) and Totana.
There was only one person trapped in Totana in the area of the very well-known owner of the company on poultry meat products which could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the position of the largest residential complex of the town of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with the “spa” -
The company acquired 2,2 million square meters of land which was retrained and its project was to double the residence of a municipality with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of companies such as Autes and Inomonar, which are involved in supporting the real estate market, the Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Corunia, Venezuela and the Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which concentrates on promotion, sale and assembly of construction elements.
And that happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from last November's most important press release Helsingin Sanomat (by the end of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18th, on the same day that the critics of Blackburn's book appeared there in the event:
“The extent of the subject of philosophy entered public discussions in connection with tragedy at school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, the high school student, quoted in his notes the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the website Helsingin Sanomat in order for the professors to take a critical opinion on Platon and claimed that there is no need to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools.

One fellow informs about the introduction of a criminal act of downloading from the Internet into criminal law:
A. Getting one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you cut down in a board store in a price below EUR 400, it is considered to be just a surplus (§ 623.1).
B. If you cut up to EUR 1 000 in the shop, the theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for withdrawing (§ 234 criminal code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in fights than to exchange compacts.
Participants shall take place between three months and one year (§ 154 criminal law) and would be a rate between six months and two years for the exchange of compacts.
(§ 270 criminal code).
E. The sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious in accordance with § 184.2 of the criminal law than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of films protected by copyright is criminalised than the provision of pornographic juvenile materials ( § 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, she's got somebody's hand off, and that's good.

My nurse will give me one of his articles on strange research called “Penias cause brain activation, especially if others get less”
Or the feeling that causes monthly pay for employees depends on how much they make to colleagues.
Research was conducted at Bonn University using magnetic resonance on tomographer and results are published in the last issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernda Weber, the author of the study and the leader of the group Views of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: ‘The greatest activation occurred when the researcher responded correctly and his colleague mistakenly.
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.

For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been following unattractively from the Court of Justice's state prosecutor in Haag, a criminal from the Balkan War.
Its mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will be leaving with mixed feelings, because the main vineyards of the massacre in Srebrenica, in which 8,000 Bosen Muslims died, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader of the Bossen Serbs Radovan Karadžič are still free.
Their names are on the list from which the name of the documentary film of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach -Karlin list - (2006, not listed in Spain), which, at the rate of detective thriller, follows from Belgrade to New York, the work of the Swiss prosecutor during the pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressure on the relevant states to draw the network.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expenditure that depends on different factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
The choice of suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, you need to clarify what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between insurance and insurance undertakings.
This commitment shall take the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking receives an agreed insurance amount at a certain amount for taking into account the payment of the damage in the event of a insurance event.
The insurance price to be determined with regard to different factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be used or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the probability that the accident occurs, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both for 25 and for women, lower insurance must be paid as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, insurance companies have come to the conclusion that people living in marriage have less accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of driving and the likelihood that it will have an accident.
The increase in frequency of driving increases probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must well study the situation in order to choose such insurance that is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show the most important variables to choose from or to the type of insurance that, in addition to the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 meet various disadvantages such as little experience with driving and short driving license when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although the ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at an acceptable price.
This type of contract would assume a customer’s co-consumption in the payment of insurance events.
The number of remunerations of the insurance event to be provided by the customer will be fixed in advance when determining the insurance price, which would be higher than would have been involved, explains Luis Noguera, Head of First Europe in Spain, the internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants, so that the client is insured against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendation.
If you are under twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
Bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, malus is an increase in the above-mentioned base rates.
“Bonus and the malus will depend on the insurance and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, she will be able to increase the bonus, explains Noguera.
After the 20 to five years limit, drivers are easier to negotiate insurance, as the customer’s risk risk index decreases due to acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended that insurance be negotiated against all risks with discount.
“Young people can usually not make use of the experience gained in advance at the time of the crash, nor in the management process, provided the head of the European company in Spain, and added that most accidents occur in the second year of the management, when the new fear has already been overcome,
However, if the client is married, but he has no children yet, it is better to negotiate insurance against all risks if his economic situation permits it.
The families with children are considered to be a client with the lowest risk index and therefore their deductions will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be against all risks with a discount of EUR 300 or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other traffic participants, starting with a third year after buying a vehicle.
“Her management is calmer and their purchase is higher, so they can afford to obtain the highest discount,” says Luis Noguera.
Pensions are recommended against all risks with a discount of EUR 150 or an insurance extended to other traffic participants if a high bonus has been reached.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of a crash, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a good reason to properly study the options of insurance that would be most appropriate for us given our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point at AC Milan that means eight-year-olds.
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in an effort to obtain a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the League - Champions - because it would mean it to Italy to be the first and the Scottish would decide to place it.
Italians have ten points, and they have already secured a course in the fifth game with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to be sure he won't get a six points before him, which will play with Benfika, which has four.
These two group D matches will play a week before the sixth round ends, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where for the first time the 13th in semifinal, in an attempt to enter the finals that are playing 16th.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others and the decisive outcome at the Giusepe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even if both men attempt to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tactate on domestic land and Celtic knows that after winning would be the first to ensure a better place in the eighth grade.
Gordon Strachan's man could even be a loser if Shachťor didn't win, but he can't rely on it because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow (2:1) last week, won the first direct play (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening of Scotland, who believe that the second time they get into semifinals in reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same game in last competition with the goal of Coco in extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 at the basic playing time.
To hope that they will win the “rossoneri” will be Shachťor, for whom the victory is worth only if Celtic lost, both for the progress to the 18th and for the continuation in the UFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no way of continuing the highest European competition, could win one win to reach third place, so she would play in the UFA.
The first concert in Spice Girls was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver.
Spice Girls began in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 viewers had their first tour since she broke up in 2000.
“Posh Spice” (Victoria Beckham), “Scary Spice” (Melanie Brown), “Baby Spice” (Emma Bunton), “Sporty Spice” (Melania Chisholm) and “Ginger Spice” (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver said that the reconnection of their group is“great.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present with a concert, which also included a video that shows the history of this group, which has created a sensation of the end of the 1990s.
Return and World Tours are played at the same time as the new album released by the EMI in Spain, which offers the choice of their main successful songs as well as two new songs, “Headlines” - and “Voodoo”
Five Spice Girls appeared on the stage decorated with bracelets given to them by the husband, Posh Spice, British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the performance of Victoria Beckham, she said about the British star, \"he didn't even see our costumes, so I'm nervous about what he thought about the performance.\"
“Sports Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998, caused two years later to dissolution of the five-member groups, also demonstrated its nervousness during the meeting with journalists two hours before the beginning of the show.
I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion changed, thinking about Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I was glad to have decided,\" said Chisholm about the reconnection of the group that she had released nine years ago.
The singer also noted that, in time, the things were balanced, and we all like each other.
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last joined in 1998.
In the beginning, according to CTV, the band arrived at Vancouver specializing in Virginia Airlines.
On arrival, the nanny army was expecting them at the airport.
Five have a total of seven children.
After a concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
He'll be in Madrid on December 23rd.
Fears of the new gas fight between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the price of natural gas, thereby increasing the risk that Russian gas supplies to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is driven by pipe over Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyiv warned that if Moscow raised the Ukrainian gas price, Russia would charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced deliveries to the EU States.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at the time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, is trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russia's gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to charge more because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas obtained from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay by 40% more for its gasprom delivery.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations,” said Reuters the Ukrainian Minister of Economics Anatoli Kinach.
The change in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine -
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a shocking fall in exports to Western Europe, which greatly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but a large part of it remains under-used.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Republics.
NHS must control foreign employees
The controller said that the Scottish NHS chamber must improve the control of criminal records in non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the highest control office of Robert Black came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was connected to June's attacks at Glasgow airport.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign personnel employed.
But his report stressed that the other key checks had taken place safely on the sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Supervisory Office was interested immediately after June's attacks at Glasgow Airport for personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexander Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone ran Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using a videomost charged with connection to bombing attempts in Great Britain.
The NHS chamber is expected to check foreign personnel from the point of view of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK before they work.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to follow the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which will help employers with controls in several countries.
Although we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks are not regularly carried out, we have reported the report.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS is in a number of agreement with its own pre-employment policy, but he also added: ‘Our report draws attention to areas where the system could be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on foreign staff’
President BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry, said that it was very unlikely that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in Scotland’s NHS work well and is not clear what further value these comments will bring,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers would probably be higher as well because the Commission had a problem identifying personnel with residence permits.
The study also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glass and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently working on a policy and a directive on pre-employment checks for foreign staff of the NHS.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: \"I wanted to do this job immediately after a terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport,
It also added that the Scottish Government, in conformity with the Health Commission, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment directives of all personnel - including the foreign - planned to issue next month.
Joy Division was in charge of film prices
Control, a live film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards on British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Film Awards.
The awards were also obtained by the star Sam Riley, who worked for Curtis' role in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the second role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was appointed the best actress for the thriller's writings about the scandal.
And Daniel Craig's bondove star got Variety award for getting a British film on the world scene.
The awards were presented in London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But he received Dutch photographer Corbijn, known earlier due to the iconic cover of U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for the best director and for the best debut director.
Rock music was focused on another award - because Juliena Temple's film about Clash Joe Strummer has won the prize for the best documentary.
The doctor for the best actor received Viggo Mortensen as the driver of the Russian mob boss in London's thriller David Cronenberg East Seed.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard guys, won Richard Harris Award for the extraordinary benefit of the British film.
This 50-year-old, including Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another piece of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of crystal skulls.
Winston said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of the films of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris who died in 2002.
“The people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me,” he added.
I've had enough luck meeting Richard Harris several times.
He is my man, the great actor of my time, I am very honored--
Independent film prices, known as Bifs, are awarded by the jury in which the filmmakers, actors and festival organizers are sitting.
Among the supporters and patrons Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people because of terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia yesterday announced that she arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and also on spiritual and security components.
State television of the largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the country.
The al-Qaeda Sympathians have led the campaign against the monarchy, the allies of the United States, since 2003, from invasion to Iraq.
The television report announced that the cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on the oil in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia builds a unit of rapid response to the strength of 35,000 members to defend the device from the failed attack of al-Qaeda on the world's largest oil processing factory in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the internal declaration of the Ministry: 18 arrested were the cells led by an expert for the launch of the rocket - which slipped into the country.
She also said that the militants planned to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
22 prisoners were supposed to prepare the murder of spiritual and security workers.
The government has encouraged the clergy to do more to prevent the Saudis from leaving Iraq to join the al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied armies and the Shia government supported by the US, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider to be here.
Al-Kaid militants believe that the authorities were coopting many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to support a royal family that controls the government.
Militants - supported by the challenge of the leader of al-Qaeda Sauda Usama bin Ladina focused on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy equipment.
\"This war was a huge effort of security forces in the past five months,\" said state television spokesperson of the Ministry.
The 16-member-Medial Cell was also arrested - in Medina, which was intended to promote “Takhirian thinking” - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promote violence against Muslims identified as unbelieving and wasteful.
There were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate in Venush may be a sight for the future of the Earth
Scientists yesterday announced that Venus could once have been a pleasant place for life.
The data from the coming European station show that the planet is even more similar to the world's own-headed twinity than it thought before.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size as the big ones, and they're running on similar precious ones, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, the conditions were similar to those on Earth in Venus and could have been local.
But the sprayed greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus to a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to make lead, and the storms and winds of hurricane power are empty.
Findings from the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet one year, offers a sober view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physical Sciences of Oxford University and one of the leading missions of Venus Express said: “It is even more clearly why the climate in Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
“Our new data enables us to set up a scenario in which Venus started as well as the Earth, perhaps even with the local environment, billions of years ago,
Police have kept the - rich uranium -
Kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was held by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police spokesperson said that three people were detained and the material was examined.
He didn't say it was a enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million ($480 000).
It's still rooted.
Mitt Romney said that for the president's candidates, it is not appropriate to answer the questions from the snowman.
Despite that, the Republican presidential candidates agreed to the YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions broadcast on Wednesday, 28 November were as comic as a snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many of the Republican parties' status towards elections next year.
It is unclear how CNN producers, one of the parties to the debate, selected clips that were then shown to aspire candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single subject, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn their ankles when they heard something comforting: the publisher recorded the peaks of consent when the candidates were talking about hard access to borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who came forward in key short votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake down the reputation of a man who was as mayor of New York, soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of the state of Massachusetts from hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
These two were particularly determined when the Tasatells asked if one of the candidates would support the “amnestia” (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Leaders like Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, Congressman from Colorado, managed to throw theirs in a mill on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to nominee, but they both stay in the game for maybe they started to hit the alarm because of immigration earlier and stronger than others.
At least in immigration, candidates have the same opinion: greater strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about poison toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the Republican to forget or minimise the dispute between the liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani has been asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether a simulation heating technique should be regarded as torture.
One tastel asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani touched it to the point that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn't quite believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another tastel asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the last survey in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thus earning a laugh.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's growth in Iowa has been concealed with recent achievements in the acquisition of money and the loud wedding of Ron Paul during the Wednesday debate.
These two have gone away from the bottom because both sides of the party still cannot agree on more well known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning news of the American size on the lips, freezing on both wings of the side.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Bolesti of the Labourists
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he might fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it's customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
There are no rules to sell, no accounts in the Paris Hotel have been secretly paid, no extra-marine fingers have been valued.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would not be able to find out that some wealthy businessman for four years masked contributions from the Laboureist ruling party of $650,000 (1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the election and insulted the British intelligence by saying that this decision was not affected by the surveys, there was a hope that it would ensure a strong and effective government.
Instead of making this up, Mr. Brown once changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unwarranted rescue of Northern Rock's problem bank showed weaknesses in the management and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals for a change in tax law brought companies together against the government.
Loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unthinkable administration.
Three generals in retirement started a rebellion in the Lords House; protested against cuts in military spending because they claimed to be commander of armed forces is a part-time job.
Now there are numerous gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Labourists (and their former internal discipline guard), he has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would have gone unreversibly towards his end.
Despite that, governments can reach a point of reclination for which they find heavy governance.
People don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually push their distrust if they take over the new crew.
While it seems clear that some prime minister will probably not improve anything, and may not be long in the office, this is moving away: state administration becomes a bitch, ministers start doing brefings, press looking for bad news, and government becomes uncontrollable and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complicated, because he cannot take a new cot against other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial office records are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in the blarish troubles, such as a long investigation of the financing of political parties caused by money - voters can be free to believe that he was.
Still, Mr Brown's hatred is not as bad as they look.
They're not as horrible as conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean's concerned, no one died or was lying.
And the treatment, however painful, is to provide what Mr Brown's steel tendencies always promised: a reliable, firm and easy brutal rule.
The latest dissipation around political gifts is a good example.
The Garboid Mr Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
Laws against anonymously large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about the progress of Mr. Abrahams, but he did not know that he was illegal, he would certainly be thoroughly questioned; also Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labourian of the money that had learned about the caring gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing that would suggest he knew about these qualities, even though the main part of the payments was made after he was in June.
The Prime Minister has done half his work so far.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but ruled out his discretion by following a proven instrument, the committee for the examination of this matter - led by an extra bishop in retirement and judge.
In this case, learning is not difficult.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of police.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent President of an independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has not had in six months, and having a real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require the labists who are in close cooperation with conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the union - bitter pills for the given party, such as Mr Brown.
But he should face some simple facts.
Conservators now have a decent lead in the surveys; he has two years to get back the voters; and the only way to win is inconceivable integrity and high competence.
Carded sharks
Does the US Credit Market affect the crisis?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, they start to move around with a cane spit.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is dirty, the predators have focused on the market for credit cards there.
Goldman Sachs' analysts say that losses on credit cards would be made if they ordered further variants of consumer credit from subordinate mortgages, they could reach $99 billion.
The stress marks are clear.
The number of cases of inability to pay (over 30 days delay of payment) and the accounts received (the accounts that the provider considers to be indelible).
The HSBC Bank announced last month that it lost 1.4 billion dollars in the US consumer credit market - also due to intermittent credit card loans.
However, it is soon on panic.
The accounts and the inability to repay are still little.
According to Moody's evaluation, 3.89% of the level of insolvency in the third quarter was almost a whole percentage point below average.
Aggravating degree can partly be explained by technical reasons.
Thus, the change in US law on personal bankruptcy in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported banknotes that make a large part of the loss on credit cards; the number of reports (and the number of write-offs) would rise regardless of whether the general conditions for the lender have worsened.
The sector also shows a good degree of maturity, which shows how many consumers pay monthly from their debts.
And trust in credit card securities is solid, despite a parallel in other parts of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research firm predicts that the volumes of their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways for the spread of infections between the crisis of subordinate mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: when they dry up property loans, consumers tend to owe themselves over credit cards.
However, credit card publishers tend to look at cash flow rather than the value of the guarantee items, so that falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the lenders.
They may even be beneficial for the lender.
Consumers' motivation to pay off mortgages when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on cards is shifting up to the payment priority list.
Card publishers will also be able to respond faster and more flexiblely to stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the prices of guarantee objects.
“We will not be able to overestimate all the loans in one beautiful morning,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One Financial Manager.
Even though the risk of an explosion in low-level mortgage style is much more real, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and reduced debts push America back to recession, the credit card sector will stand before the darker future.
Watch out for the back fins.
The British bankers admitted blame in the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to be judged for their role in fraud associated with the former financial manager of the Enron Andrew Fastow, on Wednesday, changed their statement and admitted guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew, originally guilty of seven fraud charges, when they were supposed to participate in financial fraud with Fastow in 2000 -- to enrich themselves with their employers' accounts -- to deny.
They were supposed to be in the January before the trial.
However, during a court crossing before the American district judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC units, has been on the front page for two years, which has taken place.
In the United States, their case is one of the unopened parts of the investigation started after Enron's crash in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 warned Mr. Fastov that he was the target of a government investigation on the Enron crisis.
The prosecution against bankers -- who had earned a nickname--NatWest Three -- says that in 2000 they came to Houston to try to defamate the fraud together with Fastow and his former chief branchman Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in the partner branch of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of many Erron frauds that followed Enron after the spiral towards the announcement of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this branch of zero, but our three British knew that it had a significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a bank share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper for his share in this company $25,000.
According to Fastow's prosecution, Enron has misplaced that the energy company will pay for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest 20 million dollars.
However, the 20 million were actually the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers, according to the prosecution, got 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved by roughly $1.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted the blame in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently under a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
The copy is in force for three years and one month at the Texarana facility.
All three British people were free to bail $1 million, who ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accountable tricks, could no longer hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has dropped thousands of jobs, over $60 billion market value and over $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former Chief Manager Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their role in the fall of society last year.
Skilling is more than four-year-old penalty.
Judges over Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-proliferation
The Gulfstream G550 aircraft price, equipped with Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient fuel volume for non-stop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the rich Russians, however, it is small to be returned.
“He can carry up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Deputy Gulfstream.
But none of them are interested in so many places because it is for a close family or company president--
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Military Exhibition, which is a four-day orgasm of a visible consumption in Mom's mother's exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers built their booths, hoping that fresh rich Russians would lure themselves to everything from the mahogano of unloaded yachts to diamonds decorated in cars for which they would not be ashamed of or 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully after a clear orange Porsche in a sidestand.
“It's a nice car, but it's fives and tens of them against us,” he said.
\"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market in Russia.\"
On the waves of oil, money is as good in the Russian capital as Dallas had his days.
“We went through the same stage in the '80s, when some Americans were very rich and dragged to Europe, where they looked at as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, fourth-year listener at Davis’s centre of Russian and Eurosian studies at Harvard.
Like Saudi bouncers from the '70s and Japanese in the '90s, the Russians are becoming the most prominent world losers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Klondik.
In another place in Moscow this week, the luxury conference of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chair of the LVMH Group to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods on markets like the Russian one.
(Conferents are organized by The International Herbald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people in Forbes 53 billionaires with a total asset of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the local major institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 second-rate millions of dollars in Russia.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians lived below the frontier of the existential minima.)
“There are hundreds of billionaires in Moscow -- and that is why we are all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewerry Group.
“All women are perfectly prepared, and men are all over the property.
When they were going through the evening dress on Sunday evening halls, the 21st Evgenia Yumatov and five years older Lightland Turov also referred to themselves as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I cannot decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Miss Yumatov, who was hiding in the brand-new clothing as the veteran of the red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home girl.
The fair seemed particularly focused on fresh richers, well-run Russian buyers, who are willing to sit down for several hours in road traffic, so that they can go through the warehouses that shoutly mix Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream Mövenpick, ball tables for peace, suites in Dubai, gund posters and breakthroughs.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($4.57).
“Rusová is interested in what the mark is the most expensive and best,” said Mr Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch producer of porcelain Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt’s image from hand painted blue tiles in overlife size.
The Russians, of course, are more interested in,
And indeed, the speakers here say that the Russians with old money (under Russian scales is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from the shiny logos to few known brands of limited editions that would never appear at the shopping fair.
Even so, a few thousand people, whether billionaires, billionaires, or just tourists, flooded a day in the airfields.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil bed, said that he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, wrapped with gold threads, $70 000.
And the first day he told Mikhail Lyubimov, A1 Moto sales manager, which uses high-end cars for high-end alarms, that his company sold clearly orange Porsche for $170 000 Russian millionaires.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, L.A. Connection president, who, on request, regulates luxury cars that he sold three bars to cars in style connected Greek bracelets for Rolls-Royce Shantomy at $55 000.
He showed the reporter a round of the car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had the skin covered by Swarov crystals, so that it looked like a Roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
“This Russian billionaire who wants to ride wheels from the wheat skin or portrait his wife from the crystal Zircony does not yet need to ride on those wheels,” said Mr. Karapetian.
“They are placed in their garage by thirty to forty cars.
Although many of his Russian rich clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “the Russian billionaire” does not mean anything very exclusive at present, given the great rise in prices of local real estates.
“If you bought an apartment three or four years ago in Moscow, you are probably a millionaire, at least on paper, when not in cash,” he said.
\"There are more than you think.\"
At least those who are not millionaires could pretend to be rich at the stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has drawn up four red telephone booths of British style, a broken column of fake bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, marketing manager of the company, said his team printed 500 000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
The colleagues stopped to throw around a bunch of money, or to let their friends take a picture of their mobile phone, as they rest in the middle of their spare wealth, or just cut off a few million.
“You know, in Moscow, everyone may feel like a millionaire,” said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by corrupt operations
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of this restaurant About a little more healthy and watched an ambulance that came to a white New Year's house by two houses after West Scott Avenue.
The police patrol car was soon connected.
And then another one.
“I saw the delivery of a medical examiner coming,” said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
“At that point, I knew that someone died -
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, executive assistant director of the New York Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at the house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and hope that tox screen tests whose results may not be known for weeks will help solve the mysterious death that led the New York police to send out a wave of sadness.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
“It was loyal, tenacious and hard to work,” said Mr McCarthy about Miss Arroy at the telephone interview on Wednesday.
She was my shield.
She would protect me.
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroy was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that he leaves two sons at the age of 14 and 11 and his stepdaughter behind.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson of Union County, Theodore J. Romankova, said that detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy died of unlicensed surgery.
\"It's one option,\" said Miss Walsh.
The investigation is still under way -
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon 21.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities continued to say little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is supposed to be Flore Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if Miss Castro's office heard from her.
The investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as office.
In the middle of the house of Miss Castro, with the broken pink bush in the front garden and the dalmatine barking back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the basement, the throne in the open garage of the blue barrel with the inscription “Ethyl Vanillin” - which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain wheels on one side of the hook.
Mr. McCarthy remembered that when he first arrived in New York Police Department for 25 years in New York, Ms. Arroy provided him with an invaluable help in exploring the hated and harsh political culture of his new city.
\"She said, \"On this or this, you should be careful,\" he said.
She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing.
Hope that Fed will reduce interest rates leads to the strengthening of world exchanges
The prices on both sides of the Atlantic fell yesterday after the market hope that the Federal Bank would try to calm down the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates was strengthened by calming statements by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in order to follow Ben Bernank, President Fed, said that in response to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets, the management factors must be flexible and pragmatical.
As part of the obvious efforts to calm the underraged markets in the middle of the signs of a growing credit effort, Mr. Cohn said that recent increases - partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets to the end of September and October -
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of financial conditions for households and firms would increase further.
The investors consider these statements as a signal that Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh amounts of capital on the US markets, and perhaps further reduction in interest rates to stabilise the credit conditions.
These comments also helped calm Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about the American economy when selling flats in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of financial recognition have been undermined by the notification of Bear Stearns investment bank to cancel 650 jobs, which are 4 % of its global labour force, in the context of reducing costs due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by an unsustained loan to live in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and concluded at 13 289,40 while the S&P 500 index increased by 2,65 percent more.
The FTSE 100’s London Index strengthened 16,5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,06,2 while the British blue-chips increased by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 strengthened 2.3 percent.
Some times ago, credit tensions on the markets appeared in full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash package auctions were loaned to European commercial banks at 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the English bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release overstandard money into London’s monetary markets has increased with the interest of the three-month British interbank loans, Libor, coming up after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum since the end of September - 6,59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, almost as hard as the other one.
Who's going to be the number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kanda, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Sri Lanka test, who's supposed to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who stick to this post at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the lead coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, with a decision to help, and since Hugh Morris, the main manager of the English team, begins to perform applications for a national collector, not necessarily full-time.
Whoever does not build on the sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport no more.
It is not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while someone else never gets through a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only is the choice difficult in the case and requires a judgment that must finally always be subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if you do?
We could also ask ourselves in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or/Tubby - Banjee, both smart young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the committee - instead is just one.
Who's supposed to say which level is right for the critic if he can't get his chances down or spit on the next one?
Naturally, the numbers have a great influence on decision making, but they have the same opportunities.
In the team, the critic must catch the captain's view at the right time, if he's supposed to take the Wicket, and the bat needs a regular chance at starting positions, if he ever feels like a day-old critic.
It's more complicated to capture the picker's view.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as a artillery.
Anderson took 32 victs in first grade at 33 crossings each.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same flat diameter, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hope for another.
If he plays at the stadium of Asgiriy Shah, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or finish both careers or may not have a great influence.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test, and in the first class he gave good performances, five victs and 40 holiday runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who fought for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who is additionally, although in Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shahova more experience in front of Bopar's youth cells.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shaha he speaks his sparkly and valuable debuts Test shifts to 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class compared to six Bopars, which is, in twenty years of age, seven years younger and he has excellent statistics against spins.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, only ten crossings, and that, together with immediate refusal of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to put him back on another match, his sunburn seems to have taken off something from the elan, which was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex University has joie de vivre in bones.
There's nothing on the Kriket field will get him out of the field, and his behavior symbolizes a recently flipped car on four laps on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He ran out with light injuries and probably shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his co-founder, who followed him to ask him excitedly, “You saw it”
Bopara is definitely better in the field, giving his middle speed loop pitch on the dams that seem to suit him, giving him effectively and burning off self-confidence and finely.
Choose the right person is one thing, choose the right time is different.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to get Bopara his chance now, which, of course, I don't want to say that Shah won't complete if, as the china tea tickets suggest, he'll be the one who's playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Bagdada yesterday and to drain the elopements to whom the money or the period of validity of the visa came, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even came back to fight the gunmen who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansour Bus Station was before 800 people came from Damascus in the official governmental convoy on dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned to private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Bagdad,” said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunni doctor.
I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the paper because of what was done in Bagdad and how safe it is now.
“They say that Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” said Mahdi, “he means the Shiite lover of the militant spiritual Muktad Al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kásim al-Attani, an 8th-year-old Shiite teacher from mostly Sunni region of Amaría, returned with his two children because he could no longer restore the Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amaría called him by helping to push al-Qaida out of her position in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, whom from his home in Sleikhu in northern Bagdada launched a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
“Today, a few friends called me and told me that she was going to Sleikhu lover against al-Qaeda and that she needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today,” said Sabah Al Obeidi's 20-year-old.
Many have talked about the attractiveness of calming in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and the growth of locals - the group of interesting citizens - which defend the weapons by hand of the American army by means of their fourth.
But it was more talk about the fact that they were brought to return by obstructions around the visa and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salam al-Samarraj, the 1st-year-old father of three children, expressed a loud suspicion of the refugees that Núri al-Malika, Shii Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas and thus make them come back.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
“All was fine before Al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqi visas to have to go back to Iraq,” said Sunni retired.
“I cannot trust a government that supports criminals who burned me after I left the house--
The partial reason for weakening violence is that the Sunnis have been pushed out of Shia's areas and vice versa, which reduces tension in many places.
There are fears that the sudden impact of refugees will again be draught by sectarian tensions and will lead to further struggle.
Little Sarah, good education
Germany’s smallest Greek country plays a leading role in vocational education, even with the international focus of its universities.
Only in one educational area is Sarah concerned about the same lack as the rest of Germany.
I explained yesterday that we are no French - this suicide password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal country.
On the other hand, France and Luxembourg play a part in the monitoring of the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
So high schools have traditionally been working closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Today students can end the study with a double or even triple diploma.
The amount corresponds to a reasonablely high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, a large number of Sarah children are admitted to high school - many of them without their studies in gymnazi.
“In Sarah, the training system is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, IW educational expert.
By obtaining more than every fifth youth student's permission to study at a professional school, Sarah is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarah to combine practical and academic education.
The possibility to study two fields is with regard to the number of inhabitants of the second best in all of Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, in recent years the number of graduates of engineering decreased by a third.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education has now commanded universities to develop a promotional campaign on engineering fields.
“After the first study of Pisa, we performed several reforms in general educational schools,” says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of maternity school is free of charge - a model that takes over other federal countries.
If the results of pupils improve significantly, they will show up to future comparative studies.
In the implementation of study Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
But Sarah didn't really get as much as any other federal country.
The brats can count better.
And to disappoint Sarah's study Writes do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Sarah might be right in this area.
The language of the neighbors is compulsory on gymnasies - even though the inhabitants of Sarska are not French.
The guy's moving the clock.
As soon as they don't see the clocks in Venezuela, they'll be different than the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have to move hours in this South American country by half an hour back.
In Spain, while Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official letter of Venezuela informed us that clocks, according to the new law against world time, would shift by minus four and a half hours.
The South American State will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Walk, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by making the United States a world of division of time zones throughout the hours.
In addition, in the middle of the local time, Chávez announced that, because of the case with hostages, he interrupted relations with neighboring Colombia.
This left-wing nationalist stated that as long as he was conservative by Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia, he would not be with him or the Colombian government to maintain any relations with him.
“I can’t vote because of my self-esteem,” Chávez said, asking the reform of the Constitution, which the citizens of this oil country must vote in a Sunday referendum.
This reform would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
Hadko made a decision of Uribe to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels about the release of hostages.
Uribe criticized Venezuele’s decision to spit in his face on Sunday Uribe Chávez.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez, too.
The new mobile call was triggered here: “Por que no these calls - (Why are you no longer silent?) - so the sentence that has already taken more than half a million people off the internet.
She was spoken by the Spanish king Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American peak summit of the loud remarks of this left populous, had so much to silence him in this way.
In 2007, Germans were at risk of a lower pay rate
According to the forecast, German workers are at risk of reducing real wages even through strong conjunctura this year.
Experts have justified a number of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to the estimates of the Hanse Böckler Foundation, employed people can effectively count on getting lower wages in 2007 than last year.
“The debt increase is low, the increase in value added tax and the price increase in food and energy prices,” said Bild Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
A new burden on employees may also be expected in the field of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable for the new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be able to fall into such difficulties in order to require loans or contributions from the federal youth to quote the paper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and oil products forced inflation to its highest level in the past 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the prices increased by three percent overall.
Venus is a hell of a twin Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than it has been expected so far. The European Space probe Venus Express in Venus recorded phenomena that appear in winter also on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and winds on the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have been saying that they're in love with Venus.
Now the Venus Express European probe has brought proof - caught electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. In Venush, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometres, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russel from California University in Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the origin of the primary material on Earth, the lightning produced life. The storm reportedly caused a reaction in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, fundamental stones of life.
This was not the case in Venus: ‘If there was ever a life there, it must have been a long time ago,’ explains Sean Solomon of Carnegi Institute in Washington.
Today something is barely alive on the surface of Venus. Atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
“The universe may be the Hell’s twine of Earth, but it’s a twin,” said Russel.
Why Venus, which is Earth's material and size so similar, began to develop completely differently, is the fundamental question of the mission of the Esa.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 1990s exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus, the start of the probe Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results that approached several articles of Nature magazine did not stress just the uniqueity of Venus in the solar system.
“They also showed that our neighboring planet is much more like Earth than it has yet to be expected,” Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind faiths on the northern pole, scientists found a dark wind on the southern pole, which is turning much faster.
This phenomenon reminds the air flows on the northern ground, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Institute di Astrophica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second internal planet of our solar system consists of almost the same material as Earth and with a diameter of 12 100 km is almost as large.
This planet, named Jitřenka or Evening, will be sung for no 225 days.
However, around its own axis, it turns much slower, one day on Venusha lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus's surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bar of Earth does not resemble, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both sides, however, the water was accumulated, but it remained in the oceans on Earth, while it went off from Venus to space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound on earth in carbonates, it is most of the atmosphere in Venus.
Köhler defends the Merkel meeting with the Dalai Lama
The Federal President Köhler demands termination of party disputes because of the adoption of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
He criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual encounter in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about the reputation of Germany and calls for a large coalition to end the factory around the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present ourselves at the outset as a nation that is not uniform in this matter,” Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
“I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me,” Köhler said.
Although the Federal President pointed out that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent Mercel from becoming involved when it was estimated that he was creating a new policy towards China.
“Spolková Chancellor did not forgive traditional Single China policy.
China also knows,” Köhler said.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) gave indirect expression of his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and he was attacked by a series of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, to the “first” foreign coalition policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, German-German relations have worsened.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also the SPIEGEL magazine has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
The Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merckel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader Wen Jiabao the position of China.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet and other Tibetan regions, which are also located in the territory of China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar unrests that have gone out in France
The street battles with the police, the shootings, the burned cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the similar unrest that went off in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not increase the violence on the street, calling the Federal Minister of Interior.
The barricades burned down, the invaders shot the shotguns at the police. After the serious anxiety of the youths in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior of Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar development even in Germany.
“We must be careful not to create such social tensions in our country, which will penetrate violence.
We must take it seriously,” said Neue Presse in the Hannover paper.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, the country and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate problems, said Schäuble.
Which does not only mean the integration of migrants.
\"From the summit on integration after the Islamic Conference we record the first successes -
However, caution is still on site.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In the past nights, they brought youths with police in northern suburbs of Paris, hard street fighting.
Even in Toulouse, she burned cars and public buildings.
Greater integration efforts by the German government required the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the resembling effect -
While the situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should act.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 years of age who came from migrants is the unemployment rate - above all high -
In particular, more study opportunities are needed.
The wheel pointed out: ‘We must give young people the hope of a youth.
However, the Turkish Prime Minister added that, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youthful migrants do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolata asked: “But we must be careful.
We need to allow young people to start working and to learn about themselves.
Meanwhile, there was a night at the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel mostly calm.
Hundreds of policemen were deployed and helicopters were flying over the area with headlamps.
Law enforcement has reported three arrests and several burnt waste baskets and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 traffic forces have been taken care of.
The police will intervene as long as they have to, she announced after visiting the suburb of Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie.
About 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night in trouble in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, they seized the unrest of Toulouse.
The mess caused a Sunday traffic accident where two youths lost their lives.
According to the primary findings of the state representative, there is no guilt in the death of juveniles.
In the Empire of Angela-Obreka
The Kancléř's realtor's remote output reports that the coalition is in the end and that we can't expect anything more from it.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her indiscriminate, indifferent, and indifference to the poor performance at the general debate of the Spolk Dream, we must say: not here - not in this country, which it should ultimately manage.
Regret that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Mercel replied once with a lot of arrogant sentences.
It's guilty, she said, so she showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Spolková snow, she visibly demonstrated how much she deserved the pity.
The Merkels did not feel any real interest, let alone the feelings for problems in the country.
Instead, Angela was presented: a political party that runs out into foreign policy, and there it is expressed only in misplaced.
For example, climate protection: without ceasing overseeing the conclusions of the Heiligendam summit, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, it was so self-conformity that the CDU would forgive itself two years ago.
Now she's limited to a plan phrase that could make her kiss people.
This approach damages its immeasurable pragmats, which do not need to flatter, because problems solve.
But there are internal political problems in Angela-Oblak Empire.
Child poverty and concern for people with low wages?
A few other sentences on these issues have left her.
It is worth noting how often the Merchels, when it comes to child allowances, are overestimating.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning, so that at least partly the right sentence can be spoken.
As soon as things get too specific, they'll be rounding around like they're in a completely foreign terrain.
Attack department
The debate of the Republican Presidential candidates for YouTube in the case of Rudy Giuliani and Mitta Romney's outraged dialogue - and both of them now have to be afraid of the outsider candidate.
The voltage of both candidates is shown on the first topic.
Mitt Romney prophesied his opponent Rudy Guilani that he made New York an attack on illegal immigrants -
Giuliani quickly reacts with sharp regret: “I believe his own home was just one such refuge,” she answers and predicts to former Governor Massachusetts that he had personally employed immigrants without evidence.
The candidate is in the attack, given that the Republican base is not yet clear, eight presidential candidates use these debates at CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, Internet users filmed and via Youtube sent videos serve only as such hints of the key theme.
“We have already allowed Hitler to take power with such a policy of isolation,” says John McCain of his opponent Ron Paul, who, as the only one, advocates the immediate withdrawal of the troops from Iraq.
Vietnam's veteran McCain doesn't save his regrets or Romney for refusing to condemn the torture method of interrogation called Waterboarding, where the heating is simulationd.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg show that there is no war in Iraq or torture methods among the important topics of the campaign.
The community is under pressure whenever conservative values are adopted and future tax increases are rejected.
So it turns out where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
“I was wrong at that time,” explains Romney, and asks the party base and the television audience to forgive him for being the advocate of the execution of abortions in 1994.
Giuliani is in despair when he is to express himself to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharaf for the first time reigns in a civilian
On the day after his resignation from the position of the Chief Commander of the Army, the Pakistanese ruler of Musharf's presidential oath.
That ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan Parvíz Musharf made a presidential oath on Thursday, and thus lasts for another five years in the presidential office.
Pakistan’s television transferred a live ceremony held at the President’s Palace in the capital of Islambad.
Musharaf swore that he would honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
At the centre of his office, the commander of the Army handed over his trustee to Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby subjecting to international pressure, particularly by the US.
Eight years after the unblooded military coup took power, the former general ruled for the first time as a civilian head of the state.
Musharf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West by withdrawal from the position of the commander of armed forces.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional condition which Musharaf declared on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayuma's chief attorney, Musharf will cancel an exceptional condition soon after his delivery, and so will meet the other requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the Land, which Musharaf, after the announcement of an exceptional state in early November, rejected all opposition to the disputed re-election of the State’s head on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed during the attack on a military convoy in North Vaziristan Tribal Area and four others were injured.
An army spokesperson said that the bomb blew up on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
Father's brute is coming back
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia Group were recaptured at a concert in Berlin by their electronic synthesizers.
Revival will also include Live 1974, cut from the most successful band period.
They've been much more known abroad these days.
Then the reported dream consists in the performance of three obsessed gentlemen who at first look like they're enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and especially buttons.
The 13 - year - old Dieter Moebius sitting in the middle of a snow - white shirt.
After his left is a seven-year-old Michael Rother who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
The 300-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, which is focused on harvesting over synthesizers, is from the point of view of viewers to the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by lack of sight, traditional compositions will be created.
Looks like it's too cool with the music lords.
Among the lovers of the crater, Harmonia's band was reviving a considerable break.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pops, but it is certainly not too advanced to lack this band for twenty-three years.
But why could Germany not celebrate his still living legends from the 1970 ’ s?
And especially when you have a musical style, mistakenly called krutrock, England and America value more than in their own country.
When in 2003 the music business was awarded to the remaining members of the Can Can Can Group for the life work, the hall was full of tacky views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu in their speech, the audience no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
By reminiscing on the band Harmonia we are wasting our memory, this trio existed for just two years, and at that time it had no effect on what others later added to them.
Moebius and Roedeliius have already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement of the Berlin Theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for turntable companies led by the Church.
Rother briefly multiplied by Kraftwerk, but the reputation gained as a guitarist in the Neu! band, who may have been the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, Rother followed the music of the Cluster band to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the community who fled the city.
They didn't come here as ideally as in the school I, where Roedelius was still allowed to lopot like a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a spirit-like art being.
The name for the art in question is allegedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein falcon, whose badge was allegedly found in the ashtray.
A lot of this has been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was titled “The Music of Harmonie”, followed by “De Luxe”
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting the rosium was not just self-confidence.
The CD-Live 1974 was now released during a concert in Griessem.
Rother then expressed his wish for the members of Harmonie to cook and exercise occasionally.
It was a completely inappropriate request for Roedlia and Moebia.
In 1975, the band announced her breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere and secured his future with an album-Horse heart.
Cluster's chapel was relived in the 1980s, and since then it's been more successful than Harmonia's ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for live albums from Griessem.
His record firm Grönland has taken the goal of krautrock to provide as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered by Roedeli’s solo work at that time.
The warm resurrection of Harmon will take place in the Berlin House of World Culture.
The performance within the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be the British, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the handbook - Krautrock Sampler -
He will also participate in the founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's how we sketched out the overall width of the country's influence on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled out by Harmonia.
The taste of Brian En accompanied by the most active sounds is raised in the hall: “The only true music, its future, belongs to it.
There are images on which the producer with Lemonia is in the agricultural seat.
The creation of legend also contributes to the presentation of other black and white photographs on which the set of instruments are connected with cables.
Before that, they are three veterans again employed by improvisation.
I don't put microphones on organs and drums anymore, so they can rule out those unheard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of defeating the leader.
There is no change in either the House of World Culture or the congregation.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under sound clouds and in one beautiful place she emphatically sings -Aaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would rather find roots than blues at music colleges (Can), technology (Kraftwerk) or escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams in this place -'68 - is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not let it out of peace now.
Even the most obvious part of the scene is thinking carefully.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question of man either prepares for his nerves or wishes him to experience meticulous moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
The Hunting Party and Mörderich Frieden showed up two films about the Balkans war.
But neither one of them is convincing.
The show either puts too much emphasis on acretion and shooting, or they're too touching.
This at The Hunting Party won't even prevent an actor like Richard Gere.
Good news first: War criminals Karazing and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the cloudy base of the Bosen War, the actor Richard Gere will be honored.
In recent years, we have lost this most beautiful man of the '80s, not only because he has played in many lazy, intrepid roles in fine women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, people will take the taste of another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing The Hunting Party - where does the hunter become the prey (Why must the names of the films in today must be so long and wrapped?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically the one who could become Gere if the fate and the film brand were not so merciful: a man who had his best years behind him long ago, but as concerns a similar monument still retains a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this trumf, The Hunting Party is together with the German film Mörderich Frieden, who also enters the cinema this week, only the continuation of an endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save the Serbian girl from the Kosovský sniper, and one of them will fall in love with it.
Although it is commendable that the Serbians are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There's going to be something very similar out of the movie, Kobra 11, without a highway, but it's about the war.
On the film The Hunting Party, it can be considered to examine why it has not yet been possible to make a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of three U.S. War reporters, who are married to a “ matching war criminal”, may have become a new, “Apokalypsou”, under the direction of another director and screenwriter.
But both stories are surprisingly like this: a small group goes to the forest to do something that is not able by the army, but their journey becomes a way of madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the movie The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the persuasive and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the foreman will also prescribe a romantic affair with later murdered Bosen Muslim.
The Hunting Party film can be ultimately described after reporting in the last five fast minutes of the film, which will lead to NATO, CIA and all world criminals in the last five years: catch a criminal and leave him a fair revenge for the Bosen Muslims.
This is against the logic of film creation that it would be worth turning to the International Court in Haag.
This film has a deep human message.
It condemns that Karadić and Mladić are still free, and suspecting Americans and French (this is why they are exceptionally united) that they do not have a strong impact on persecution based on classified political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women attack us with a famous Brecht poem.
It includes a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table writer: “I look at the sudden veins on the forehead, to note: how hard it is to be evil. ”
In the movies like The Hunting Party, they make exactly the naked heads, which, however, suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited only to the subject of the Balkans war.
Recently, in these newspapers, it was said that all Hollywood films of Iraq were a big failure.
One can be added: No good film about South Africa has ever been filmed yet.
Almost always says: When the star slides around the crisis area or passes through the mine field, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette will be created, the Hrynice break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprie.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
After all, they had to run out of ten years before Hollywood could film a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must probably be released - films that are now considered to be classical Vietnamese works - “Apocalypsa - or “Olowied vest” - were not celebrated at any time as a master’s work.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home shows up on two paintings, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Scenarios don't have the ability to tell good stories without doubt.
“To be or not to be“ or“A great dictator,” they became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcasticly measured artistic view as a novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked for a parallel between his historic novel - Lemprière’s dictionary - and “Balcan war - he said:“The likeness is only in that some things never change.
The great city will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust licks the criticism of the olympiades
The resignation of mayors since the summer Olympic Games in Hamburg hit a sharp criticism of politics and economy.
Many want to continue to fight to organize games in the water.
Von Beust, however, calls for realism in the estimate of the chances.
The main host of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, marked this decision at the centre - from the point of view of business as unhappy -
No other project has been built in the city recently as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
‘Without this goal, this sportically political enthusiasm would not be possible to maintain such a high degree’
Schmidt-Trenz called for the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, which is based on a revised timetable -
Mayor Ole von Beust remained in the middle of his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least until 2028 unrealistic.
“No Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union decides about the Olympic candidacy”, said von Beust to the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sport Union will decide on the appointment of Munich for winter games in 2018.
“This reference for us means that we have no realistic opportunity with the time plan of 2028.”
Yet this dream is not over yet, he said von Beust.
The Hambur sports union (HSB) marked von Beusto’s statements regrettable.
It feels that Hamburg does not want to deal with Olympic games in the next twenty-five years.
“It is too soon to destroy the chance that we will already mark the plans in this early phase as buried,” said President HSB, Günter Ploss.
The end of the investigation would be contrary to the statement by the chief of the Senate, which he conducted at the General Meeting of the German University of Sport.
Von Beust here for Haburk's opening at the University in 2015 did not report as a substitute for the holding of Olympic Games.
The high school sports union Hamburg was only nominated for a candidate town last week.
The Faction of the SPD in thehamburg Senate has revealed that it is wasting valuable time, which could be used to build flats in Hamburg.
“Klein Grasbrook has been braked by the Senate for years because he has entered the Olympics and the construction of flats,” said SPD Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook was still planning the Olympiad area with the fact that the whole area will later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously placed on the ‘olympian factor’,
Avoiding the summer Olympic Games in 2012 caused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, has fallen to Leipzig.
That's not Warhol's box.
Whoever joins the terms of Sweden and the wooden boxes doesn't think of Andy Warhol, but Ikeu.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes produced in Sweden currently refer to the list of Warhol's work of dark shadows.
Most of it on the list given 90-four-Billo boxes - Stockholm are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper -Expressen - several months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol’s ‘Billo box’ - from 1968 comes the internal research of the Modern Museet Museum in Stockholm with the result of the dissipation; the 6’Billo boxes, which in 1995 dedicated to his former director Pontus Hulten, are copies - as most of the other ‘Brillo boxes - Stockholm, which are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a frozen chain of art and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes, which were based on a red-made design paper box of soap powder Brillo.
The exhibition of his works in Modern Museet in 1968 demonstrated - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from the carton. They were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It wasn't an art work, it was about their ancestry, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently gave in 1968 also a permit for several wooden Brillo boxes to produce in Sweden, but they are not exposed in Modern Museet.
These witnesses are now talking about fifteen boxes, which were then rightly entered into artistic and educational history as authorized originals - \"Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy\", with the name Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over 100,000 dollars.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hulten Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made in Sweden and exhibited about a hundred crates which then Warhol left for him.
In fact, 105 Hultin's crates were made in Malmö for the exhibition in St Petersburg only in 1990.
At that time, Warhol was three years after he died.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator of Modern Museet, studied in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their cross-section boards were covered with a basic color and shrouded, were covered with oil white.
On the contrary, it appeared from the pattern of copy from 1990 that the colour was applied without the previous base paint to the painter's role directly on the glass board - in addition to acrylic and not oil color.
“These boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Billion Brillo Boxes,” said the director of Modern Museet, Lars Nittve:“If Andy Warhol Art Authority Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Modern Museet will have to make six of his exhibition collections classified as “exhibition material - copies -”
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these “principle charges”, which were raised in the case of a box with soap powder, would be dealt with.
However, the organization is still in unexplained silence.
Rebeling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who settled in one hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The leader of the rebels Antonio Trellanes, who was involved with the president of manipulation and corruption during elections, told the reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government before they attacked with the deployment of a tear gas to the hotel.
About two dozens of soldiers have been built in the building a few hours before.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court because of a frozen attempt to reverse in 2003, and there was a Trollanes among them.
The meeting used to escape with its about 30 sympathies.
Military police officers who were supposed to guard him apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Governmental units of the area around the selected hotel have closed.
The President called for an emergency seat on the safety cabin.
Councillor for the National Security of Norberto Gonzales condemned the military act.
