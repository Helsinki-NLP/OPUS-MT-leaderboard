Right-wing popullist triumph in Austria, total 29 percent
The incredible weakening of both sides of the present large coalition and the strong reinforcement of right-wing populist parties has brought to the attention of the first preliminary results of Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has particularly suffered strong losses where the position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaking.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korean captain Jörg Haider, is planning a triumphal return to national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes, however, is losing 5.5 percent of the votes against the last 2006 elections.
Even worse, ÖVP, which loses about 25.6 percent of almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both these great parties in Austrian postwar history and especially for people who have created early elections, literally a catastrophic outcome.
Even after the beginning of July, when ÖVP came out of the coalition, the people had a significant lead in preferences before the SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation has already sounded about the possible resignation of the President of the Party and Vice-President Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers judge that this could be done on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Bureau of the Parties.
Such developments would probably facilitate the way towards the increasingly likely exit from the election outcome, i.e. to restore the large SÖ and ÖVP coalition.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) they had initially reached 18 percent and BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - but the social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999 when the people agreed with the populists (then FPÖ was still united, in 2005, they had left BZÖ to the common government, which even called for sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already said that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna to national policy.
The Green Party, which was easily lost to Parliament and fell between Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties has clearly failed the four percent border and has not reached Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were charged with illegal collection of bugs in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg would have resulted in some cooling of Czech-India relations.
The Minister said this in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdji.
“If it did not work out, then yes, then some cooling would occur,” he said after a meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
Muchherds after the hearing said that it might be difficult for executive action to intervene.
However, he stated that, in the case of Petra Šváchy, who had been extorted and punished by fines, the central government may deal with the local government in Dárdilžing, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the Minister said.
For Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, Mukhherdi would be the best to appeal to a higher instance.
He may then ask for release to bail, and for the judgment to wait for freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that he also expressed himself to his partner at the meeting.
“It recommends a appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him,” said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way he can enter the Czech Party in the whole matter is to provide the condemned legal support - said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that he was already providing such assistance to them as well as to the Indian side.
“We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relations that have long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge that, said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We truly consider it a deep mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
The Minister avoided the question of whether he had received from the Indian party the promise to deal with things.
“I have had quite a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech Republic judges the fight for the seabed
They will join a walled electronic map on which Australia is shown and adjacent to the sea.
However, he does not care about the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia, along with its adjacent seabed.
The area is large as the continent itself,\" says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of UN workers for the matter of oceans and maritime law.
His boss, director of division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, interpretation is watching and sometimes fulfills.
There's a work emancipation and enthusiasm.
The sea bottom has been hiding a few known worlds, rich in natural resources.
It can be found here by oil, ores and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms that have the key to developing a medicine against cancer.
Days greater than land
The coastal states have now begun to take a firm action on the new sub-sea territory.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights as agreed in 1982 in Monte Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental mucus, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, this claim is exclusive to all the resources of the Continental Salvation.
“Just as the continental beast is to be placed behind the seabed, and its foundation is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea.
It goes beyond the coast of the sea, often beyond the border of two hundred sea miles called the exclusive economic zone, explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental beast shall be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has yet discussed five requests, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three other countries have succeeded so far,” adds Mikulka.
The world's voice recently recorded the success of Australia, which was the first to significantly spread its sub-sea hands.
He also acquired New Zealand - the area of the seabed which the committee had granted him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is about six times larger than the size of the state itself.
Millions of dollars invested in the survey of both countries.
The profit they use in the future will be invaluable, as they promise.
Other States shall submit their requests gradually.
They can do so until ten years from the moment they ratified the Convention of Monte Bay.
Where the continental beast ends, the oceanbed area begins, the Convention declared ‘common heritage of mankind’
There is no more exclusive position here.
The right of mining in this area shall be conferred on the Convention established by an international institution.
“Morse bottom, but there is no Klondajk”, says Director Mikulka, who says that its single areas are legally clearly defined and their arrangements are contractually anchored;
Czechs in Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of the Eastern Block in the framework of the Joint Organisation - Interoceanmetal -
This was acquired in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of a so-called non-cooperating investor.
It is authorised to extract ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaiin islands and Kiribati.
The surveyed area investor is slightly bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's part of the day, it's like a submersible Tater replica.
-It can be used on a platform with a total area of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich location of polymeric concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan,” states another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Rober Sandev division has shown one such concretion.
It reminds me of a small potato or, with a little fantasy, a fearful grey which, according to legend, restored to Gold.
The German Special Founding Unit was during the release of hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany when dealing with hostages - experts arrived.
When the situation went down, special units were prepared, but there was no deployment.
In the public, further details of the circumstances of exemption from 11 in Egypt of the kidnapped European tourists are gradually being made.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were involved in the rescue event.
According to the Ministry's statement, both the Federal Army experts and the members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police of GSG9, the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as experts on logistics from the Technical Services (Techniches Hilfswerk).
However, according to another communication from the speakers, the two ministers from Monday afternoon had no need for the German forces because the kidnappers had left their prisoners to go and flee when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government said that Germany has accepted the aid offered as a support force for action on the ground.
“As a matter of fact, one of the spokespersons of the Federal Ministry of Interior said.
They took a group of travelers from five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and also eight of their Egyptian guides on the south of Egypt on 19 September.
After kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, hostages moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the exemption or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, saving is in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't express himself to the details of release.
There is no information available in Berlin yet when saving will return to Germany.
According to the “Bild” letter, all five tourists should also leave one of the German airbuses and to Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress had a tight majority drop in a rescue package for the financial markets worth $700 billion.
Index Dow Jones has fallen strongly.
In the ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the American House rejected the government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of the US President George W. Bush and the frontal policies of both sides, a program that should mitigate chaos on the financial markets was not found by most.
Dramatic events have desperately tried critics for a $700 billion package yet to convince.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called for a plan not to be popular before the vote of the Members.
“It is difficult to gain political recognition for avoiding something that has not happened before,” he acknowledged.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the investors were concerned that the state rescue package might fall.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised to fall again after notification of the collapse of the package.
Experts are now counting with other serious turbulents on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents record the growing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, he increased significantly to winter seasons by more than 30 percent compared to the previous year.
Despite weak economic growth, the taste of the Germans remains to travel unhappily.
For the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded an increase in turnover by 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as Germany’s travel union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, there are more reservations available for autumn months.
Thus, according to the statement of the DRV for October compared to 2007, it was about 11 percent higher.
For these results, the GfK numbers, which evaluates the data on reservations from 1200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them to the overall market.
By this result, the reservations of the tours were included, which took place by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, they are primarily asked to travel to the USA, said DRV.
In these trips, there is about one third of the reservation.
In addition, there are particularly desired goals for Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as domestic waters in the Germans.
First of all, organized tours are in course, declared the chairman of DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food expenditure, there are costs for the customer to be easier than individually organised holidays.
Laepple explained that the money could be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early reservation or all-inclusive offers.
Even in summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so in comparison to the previous year, there will be a higher turnover again - although according to another study, the number of Germans who have taken some route, decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
In the end, a repeated pop, a beer from tuplas and prominents in circles from famous designers.
For the first time on a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, television moderator, and she wears a hand-to-hand cut.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is made of scondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes away from beer meadows, and we're already getting photographed, and we've got memory cards, that's what I like, for the first time in Oktoberfest.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems that my cheap circle has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage regime, and so my feeling of comfort in the circle was rather limited.
But right after the arrival on Theresa, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone's wearing women's rings or leather pants; no one sees agitated or embarrassingly affected - everything is completely normal.
Strange views of the banana stand in chocolate are only about my coat.
One Munich warns me that I mistied her: ‘On the left you are free, in the middle of the virgin, right-handed, in the back of the widowed,
I'm going to throw the butter from the back of the left.
- Okay, he says and smiles.
Other with subtle flirting techniques do not deal so much with and they have simple flat hats with inscriptions -This wire to get dressing - and they spray naked asses on the surrounding side.
A young man with such flashing tendencies is called Bob, he's from England, and Oktoberfest arrived for the first time, too.
It seems to be “gogeous” with a prolonged-óóno
That tells me after you've been sinking about a drunk masculine.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks they're garbage baskets.
Bob is therefore one of the feared “Wildbieslers,” as he is called freely ovating people in Bavaria.
The others have no alcohol to get rid of themselves this way.
Around eight o'clock, they run around the area, where Oktoberfest is held, houffians who need to take care of the poor drinkers.
Health professionals always appear in the flocks - in four carry a mask from the tent to the tent.
They work like most visitors of beer meadows: empty there, full back.
Who lies under the sail of this mercenary coffin is not seen.
\"That's the one that can't go on,\" calls me in response to my question, one of the health professionals and disappears in the crowd.
Police posted the name of the victim of an accident.
It was published by the name of a 13-year-old woman who died in the hospital after she was hit in Essex by a car.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carol Paulson from that more Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 11-year-old man was arrested for suspected careless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
The Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to try to enter the European Union, they longed for European powers to penetrate deep into the Turkish lock.
On the east bank of Bospor, maybe only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the non-reientance style.
Then you'll be told by a tourist guide.
The building sits in the end of the tower platform on every corner, looking at the unrecognizable German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a person gets inside a jewel of treasure, he can no longer have any doubt about the size of a business whose worst gate station was.
The station in August 1908 opened the German consortium Anatoly-Bagdada Corporation.
Germany, which joined the games of the empire late, intended its ambition to control the Middle East to implement using this railway that was supposed to lead to Damascus, Bagdada and further to the territory which is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their colleges were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular forces.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by frozen borders of the cold war, is gone
The British and the colonial forces proceeded from Egypt and forced Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And the bad news came for the Hydarpas station.
In 1917, the ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkey's resources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually been warm and history is surrounded by it.
But today this gate to Anatoly and further to the east serves - at least symbolicly - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The Government Party of Justice and Development - ACP - created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on the night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet one of the leading ACP experts on foreign policy, Turkish Member of the Suatet Kynikliogl.
Next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after the circulatory ride of the tracks, which reminded the ancient world rhythms of the known document Night Post, I arrived at the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for the secular state, who wants to turn his back on his ommanian past.
However, the ACP with its well-known Islamic roots represents a shift of the paradigmat of the Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicions in the west, especially in Washington.
Taxi brought me to the main state of ACP, ultra-dominated stone and metal building, deliberately built on the emerging suburbs, surrounded by half-circled commercial houses and handliners for power, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could still be a middle-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Sako, a tie, I'm sure Blackberry had one too.
The aim of the foreign policy of the Party is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest vicinity.
Cold war was an anomaly,\" he told me.
Turkey has been cut off since its disappearance.
Today, they must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to be both.
“But surely there will be a moment,” I asked,“when Turkey may have to decide,”
“Turecko,” said he,“ did not ask for such a decision to be made,
Then he pointed out what nearly all of the people I spoke to here said to them almost in awe: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea are just as in favour of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go on these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpas station, after another enlarged night, I thought of the two German lords Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched this building build up a hundred years ago.
How they would be surprised if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East can now be, from a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting for a ferry back through Bospor at the port, I remembered that during those days Turkey was called a “powerful man of Europe” -
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt that the continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memoryable Lifes: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a guildford musical leader since 1962, Vernon-Tod - Handley (necrolog, September 11th) was in charge of Guildford Philharmon Orchestra and congregation.
As part of the periodic music plan, he set up a year for this excellent congregation of young Proteus.
He was about to be 21 years old, but at the time Proteus was last singing in 1979, there were some of us 30 - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name “Proteus” (mytological shape converter) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to enter any music that was presented to him - whether madrigaly or Messiaen, whether alone or with the entire orchestra.
Music flexibility created by such a young congregation was often stunning, always exciting and all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged throughout the time.
How often did Todd tell us to let music speak for himself?
He said, \"The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it!
His tactic technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatoric nor moan.
Whatever music standard he was, he's always picked him up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If some conductor was to be matching the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when Guildford's Philharaminian conductor was from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I've reviewed more than 100 concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed with any of them - and have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply pulled one or two simple furnaces around the world.
There will be many of us missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neoklolog William Woodruff (25 September) claims that in 1946 he returned to the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at the Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD.
This is based on Woodruff's notes by the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he finished disertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He really spent the 1950-51 years in America as a researcher at the Hoblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he originally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
I recommend the show of José Vicente Resiny -Flamenco and his life - because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was moved by the simplicity and strong charge with which he acted on the audience, and by consideration and respect for the photographed.
A show that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments -
The Honda will attack his best seller for the second time.
In November, the Honda launches the sale of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already has a significant space, it now offers even more spacious interiors.
This includes improved engines that increase the comfort of driving and allow greater fuel saving.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this single-space vehicle.
For example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Even before the new model is examined, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed to cool this model shorter than other producers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is a less famous model, in other markets it became a phenomenon.
This must be the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year's year 2008.
Just in Japan, nearly a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market has become an old continent with approximately half a million pieces sold in six years.
However, Honda aims to increase its sales in the new Jazz category.
That is, while in 2007, this Japanese company sold 88,000 pieces of Honda Jazz, in 2009 estimates accounted for 100 000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which means 6,7 % of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch management expects the sale of 2 000 pieces for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly ease its sales decline in Spain.
Car management so de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% decrease.
Even though this increase in sales increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, then, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
In order to achieve this share, Honda will rely on the success of her next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid compact size with a length of 4,37 metres from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200 000 pieces per year worldwide.
As regards the markets, according to the Japanese producer estimates, 50 % of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage is divided by an old continent and Japan.
The start of the sale of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of the next year as soon as he is presented to the public in January in Valencia.
In comparison to the first generation, all dimensions have been increased in the new Jazz.
Its length has increased up to 3,9 metres (about five centimeters more), width to 1,69 metres (by two centimetres more) and axle width to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, height has not changed and is still 1.52 metres away.
The expansion of dimensions has also increased the internal space.
However, this benefit was achieved by using a new platform, but by storing a fuel tank in the middle of a vehicle which was already used for the previous Honda Jazz.
Also the volume of the luggage space - which has a double bottom system - has increased up to 399 litres more than the volume of the luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the engine 1.4 because the volume of the luggage space at the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as the rear LED light or the possibility of equipment glassed with a panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
Doors leading to the second series of seats allow an angle to open 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
For the second generation, the Honda Jazz are new and new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and provides an excellent improvement of the propulsion system at the same time with a high torque in full-scale engine speed.
The first engine with a capacity of 1.2 litres has a power of 90 horses at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 speeds.
This engine - which for the previous generation of jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with a power of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
-Auto bee - prevents precipitation
To progress in the development of accident protection technologies, Nissan was inspired in nature this time, specifically at the bee.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes as a role model for flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in emergency prevention technologies.
In cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technology Research, the prestigious Japanese Tokyo University has developed the Centre for Progress.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the general director of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four areas of the Nissan safety shield.
The robot is responsible for strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation in cars of this brand.
During the flight each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the composite bee eyes that are able to see in all directions in a angle greater than 300 degrees, which enables the bee to fly in his personal space without stopping.
The engineers designed what they called laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are located up to two metres in the 180 degrees radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the onboard microprocessor signal, which immediately converts it to a warning before collision.
The moment the obstacle is recorded, the worker imitates the bee movements and immediately changes the direction of turning the wheel to the right or even greater angle to prevent collisions.
The biggest difference compared to any existing system is that all debilitating maneuvers are absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobile Laboratory and the main engineer of this project.
The robot, unlike the bee, cannot move upwards and downs or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction that is possible by turning its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities such as the bee.
Therefore, besides speeding up and slowing, Nissan also used the rotace function to prevent accidents.
The device needs only every few seconds to process the information and to maintain the information according to these data.
It does not require storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which can work without interruption with just two dozen kB memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about the giga or the mega in the memory.
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, technology in which Nissan predicts use in series cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to build a unit into a GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the driver to the target and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy your fear before you take a mortgage
It should be recognised that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has enough capital to give injections, does not miss any ingenuity.
Faced in the face of a crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages to banks with a doubtful solvency, it created a popular-published game on the Internet--Bad Credit Hotel--
Ori -The hotel of bad loans -... or a mixed hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist looks glamorous to make a person once, twice or three change whether the right time is to ask for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even though not very detailed.
It is a more suitable site for young people than space for the public.
And what happens when the game ends?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because I prefer not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up his equity MUFG
Morgan Stanley's bank house announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that spends nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital.
One week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that the MUFG intends to buy 9,9 % of Morgan Stanley's current shares at a single price of 25,25 dollars, which represents a total surplus of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of securities at 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests another six billion dollars in obtaining converted securities that provide 10% of its return and whose currency price is $11.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average single price of $229, i.e. 28 % under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's stock still lost 6,79% and got to $27.07 at around 17.00 Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to speed up Morgan Stanley’s transition to the Statute of banking holding,” explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
The new statutes were adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow him to develop its activities, but it also puts it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest essay from Wall Street to take a much more careful approach than before.
Conditions presented on Monday, among other things, show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Morgan has only announced last Monday that he will sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“Just a week ago we thought,” explained Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of the MUFG, that our participation will be made exclusively of common shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economic and market, we wanted to reduce the risk to a minimum and also to cover our own concerns.
On the basis of weighted average prices, the MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into a normal share in a year if the last time they will be named for a certain period of exchange at a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase his cash balance.
However, the group spokesperson refused to provide clarifying information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast of the ratio of payment of Tier One around 15%, i.e. one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August, he reduced his balance.
The last few weeks were demanding for a group, since its stock exchange rate fell by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt were growing.
These costs have been reversed on Monday, but they have remained high, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs announced that she had chosen 15 billion dollars from the large investment banks of Wall Street after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quitu.
Reintroduce the republic around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project Venezuelce Hugo Cháveze, the Bolivejce Eva Morales and the Ecuadororce Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third term was put to the vote, following the pattern of his counterparts and friends, a proposal for a new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum - yes -
“No, according to these results, 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the voting leaves were empty.
To be adopted by the Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out at the exit of the electoral rooms and the calculation of non-governmental organisations predicted a clear victory on Sunday - yes, with them within a range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa was required to win his draft Constitution last night on Monday.
“The establishment won the entire line,“ he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil governorship, 280 kilometers south of Quita.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chinese counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the Organization of America (OEA), took place peacefully, covered the text of 444 points building a new socioism, promoted by the President.
The draft Constitution sanctifys the power of the state over economics by reserveing it - planning development - the countries living mainly from the oil mining of foreign companies and the commissions sent by its emigrants.
The proposal chosen by Correa in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of the State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to launch the House.
Correa has already announced that he will take advantage of this authority and will apply in February 2009 for a new mandate.
Among other things, the Constitution strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the President began to introduce in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, the ban on foreign troops will end the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as the starting point of American drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian commander attacked 11 tourists and their eight-member escort who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held ten days in captivity in the desert, were alive on Monday and reared to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, they were released by the Egyptian command in Chad.
The Russians arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft on the military base al-Maza, close to the international airport in Cairo.
They were transferred immediately without being able to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the marginal residential district of Cairo to be subject to medical examinations.
“There are no ransom payments on the roadways of the Egyptian Minister of Turism Zohejr Garrana,” said.
Since its entry into force of September 19th during safari in a vehicle with a drive of all four wheels on the foot of the Uanat mountain, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages was dragged from one hiding to the second 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of the Aegyptous Agency, safari organizers.
A representative of the Egyptian security components indicated that 30 members of special units, who approached the site on board two helicopters, set off at the stand during the night just before dawn.
“There was a shooting, half the kidnappers were killed and others fled,” said the source he wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of Egyptian special forces from the Brussels unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian Commissions.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is currently located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of Italian special forces.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result through professionalism and efficiency of people from our secret services, with special forces,” he said without further clarification.
He also claimed that the ransom would be paid.
In the present day, the Sudan army declared that it was holding a vehicle with a drive of all four wheels on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six of them, including the Chad Commander, and two arrested.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Dárfuru, the Movement for the liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Subtitles - Quiet majority of cultural resorts
The debate on the financing of culture fills the site of the newspaper’s titles and is the topic of the ongoing pre-election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise up to lament poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memory sites that commit hunger?
Which politicians would rather remind the federal government that they would forget their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore a mere Chinaon castle in the Loir Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that protecting cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in synergies.
In Québek, in the Federation of Québek history companies, at least 40,000 volunteers have volunteered to 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and geneaology to cover history, maintain a pile of private archives and protect the archaeological remains for a few minors.
These are often these companies guarding the dogs of our monuments who are driven by no means to protest when the promoters and the leaders of the actors leave their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeterys.
When do we finally get to the Tribune for history and monuments?
Benelux’s governments will be part of Fortis’s State Bank
The Benelux States will help the Belgian-Handian Bank of Fortis, which is the first to have problems in Europe due to the widening effect of the crisis of the US mortgage market, by partial state: three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has capital participation in Hungary, with an amount of EUR 11,2 billion.
This weekend has been agreed at the highest level of Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government as part of the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area, which, in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, spreads in waves for longer than a year, has been put into a great crisis, and the decisions made in this case could, in some respect, be considered as precedents.
In the sense of the decision that was born Sunday night, all three states will smoke almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets.
The Bank will sell a part of its capital participation in total, especially the insurance activities purchased last year by ABN Amro's Dutch banks.
Fortis bank shares began to shrink rapidly last week, in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis appeared in the constitution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let her break.
The company's securities fell only on Friday at 12 percent, at 14 years minimum.
Since January, the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
However, given current prices, the overall market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, according to the managers of the company, this is unrealistic.
The management of the company is ultimately guilty of the collapse of Fortis’s uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the U.S. package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the stock has been slightly rising.
On Friday, a new Director-General Filip Dereckx was appointed to the head of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has ever volunteered with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors have no need to worry about their money.
There was no panic between the bank's clients, and the branches were not taken by attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
Pigment line
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's data on the purchase of drugs, often reject the possibility to conclude a insurance contract with the tenderer.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
‘There is a data protection programme that implies the use of prescription data in any case on the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust a courier to the fox, - quote Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
The insurance companies shall make the insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health status of the applicants and, if the risk is assessed as too large, they shall not even close the insurance.
They had previously sent the medical examinations concerned and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of the customer identification number from the pharmacy, he will easily find out what drugs he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself shows how he suffers from the disease and what his medical condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering medicines, it refers to his practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
There are now several versions of the programme in circulation, some determine simultaneously the risk coefficient, so insurance companies almost have no work left in addition to paperwork, although minor problems arise.
I do not agree that any medicine can be used for several purposes, for example certain compounds are used against migraines or fever, but are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant risk factor from the commercial insurance perspective, although not the first term of difficulties.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, special companies were created which, before they had the necessary information from the pharmacy, require the patient to be authorised.
This is what the authorities are now doing, although they have not punished them for their recent negligence.
Some companies have recently worked out the results of laboratory tests that link with data on used medicines, which can give even more accurate picture of the patient’s health condition.
The data has access to more and more companies, while monitoring their use will be increasingly complex.
There is a specific law to protect health data, but its effectiveness applies only to providers of health services and insurance undertakings.
The draft law which gives authorities the power to control also companies specialising in the provision of data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that it is not enough: it has therefore developed its programme in such a way that the data transfer is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that he can hardly deny the consent concerned, otherwise the insurance companies will not close the contract with him.
So hens are just a little bit exposed to a fox of good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, this topic has led to the agenda next to other, mostly global problems also on the agenda of the 9th meeting at the highest level.
Today, the French-Indian Summit will also be held, where cooperation in the field of nuclear energy will take place.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a developing democratic power that should be given greater opportunity to speak to international affairs, but the Member States have not yet managed to find a common denominator on the issue of support for the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not further discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double trade within five years, or to increase to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, it is not an overly ambitious target.
In that sign, twenty six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were brought in legal terms, so that the green had been brought into the future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi has been among EU partners to the ninth place.
Summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with respect to terrorism, was condemned by both parties in all its forms and called for a speedy call for the UN conference.
They also affected the termination of the Dauh business negotiations, although they both have a great share in its recent failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that by 2020 it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent.
India also agreed with this, as with the need for a global agreement and gas production to reduce the greenhouse effect by 2050 by 50 percent at the climate conference next year.
Both parties would also like to prevent increased food prices and encourage the call for an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is today arriving in the French capital, where the bilateral meeting is about to conclude a trade concerning the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes that the mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion will be obtained by the French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the Agreement should apply for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of Buchmes, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from a hundred different countries to take 171,790 metres of square fair with over four hundred thousand titles to see, Turkey as an honorable guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inaugural ceremony in Italy: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centrals (Punto Italia) at 264 square metres of exhibition area.
It will follow a press meeting at Room Structure Buchmeses in theavión 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives in the state of publishing in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors' books is still reduced in relation to the total Italian production, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Found a Steve Fossett plane, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, flying across the desert in Nevada.
The Troskys were discovered on a single mountain plane at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sieřra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aeroplane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, solved the doubts that were still left: “The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossert flew on the day he disappeared,” he said at one press conference.
Therefore, the Sheriff explained that the human remains were not found or on a plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire is considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the recognition of the troika were sent by an investigation team that finally identified the aircraft: it was exactly Bellancu 8kcab, unknown since 3th September 2007, when Fosselt flew from Yerington in Nevada to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fossett's personal objects were found with one couple close to their dwellings in Mamath Lakes.
It's two documents with Fosset's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, cash money and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsthands.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in the air balloon: two weeks of flight by plane.
Three years later, the world flew on a plane and no landing.
Many of his records also include years at a height of 15.445 meters above Andami, even with a co-pilot.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the \"compapt\" - jeep houses of the star, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring news into this sector.
Because of its unconventional processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional and communication that will accompany Suv Glk to the market and which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showsrooms from the next 17th October.
In this way, advertising campaigns accompanying the debut of a new vehicle will also start informal communication through a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
The project of maximum posters, divided into three different stages, will be dominated by the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new communication will begin by performing a car in stereoscopic vision and by using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
For real, when you look at the picture, you'll feel that the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in various moments in all its small ones, so that it will then be repositioned in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotyptypic region of automotive communication.
Will he be able to raise the interest of future customers in this way?
So we already know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Triveneta, they're risking Daspo.
Who is these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are part of the group -Ultras Italia - who has been watching Nazionele azurra for years and who has been still, to the truth, has never been a problem overrated.
She never even met a opponent's fan.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
Founders come from Triveneta.
From Verona, Padova, Terstu e Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglio were added to them.
They have three-colored flags on which cities of origin of the participants appear: Saturday night they removed them so that they would not be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levi.
Figc has made available Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all in the name, i.e. easily checked.
And Viminale checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one who would be forbidden to visit the herds.
The four blue fans who had earlier retreats from the stadium rejected the ticket and were banned.
Now Viminale is waiting for him to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or identified during the extremity.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also across Europe.
Our hooligans, just like that, won't go to one more stadium.
For luck.
But now there is fear of emulsion: that means more than 100 fifty are added to those.
“We must immediately put out this fire and do not justify those who behave in this way - are confirmed by Viminol.
So, “rightly open eyes, mainly due to national play in the middle of Leč“
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow is Osservatorio, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
“Sborrow Leader-Man, and a tight arm during Mamali's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime--
This is Domnica Mazzilli's idea (a truly few lucky way), which is the director of the Viminal Osservatoria for a few weeks (which had already been Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been a Quaestor in Tersto, where the Ultras Italia core is located, based in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that there is no crime in Bulgaria to celebrate the leader, but of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist - adds an Osservatory One - crimes are attributed to the country in which they have become.
So far, this group has remained within limits, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistle at Mamali anthem: it is not even a crime, but if you allow it, it is an indecency.
