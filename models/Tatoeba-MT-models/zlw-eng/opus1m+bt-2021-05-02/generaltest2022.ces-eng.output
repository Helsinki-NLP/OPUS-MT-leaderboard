The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel French was called to NHL
The Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel French, who has been going through a tough period of his career in recent months, returns to NHL.
One-year-old plzenian family will be on the barber, and soon he could get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper Litvínov, Plzně or Russian Čeljabinsk hurt in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of playing with Vegas, he's been shooting and since then he hasn't shown up at the NHL gliders.
The incident took place at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to another.
“Pavel French will be injured in the lower part of the body outside of approximately three to four weeks,” announced the whole of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to a goal in the NHL was eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, the American time was called from the farm where he got four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL he wrote 94.5% of his cover.
He wants to finally go over and confirm that the best leagues of the world belong.
In the last year, he had problems with hips and in a short-cut pandemic year he didn't get one play.
In the NHL “France”, 36 games were taken, the success of the cuts is 92.3%.
Charles has a Christmas wish to plant Camille's box, William and Kate are serving in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as a Christmas wish this year.
He also published his wish to Prince Charles, who used the photograph on which his Choti Camille helps to put on the bugs.
On her website she informed the British BBC intelligence station about it.
They send friends, coworkers and superiors to whom they cooperate.
The photographs were created anywhere in the desert landscape.
The Duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dress in khaki color and the dress has also Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing as well as Princes George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photo, William and Kate didn't do it, it's not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, the royal family for photography designated as Christmas wishes was taking on a package of straw before a pile of wood in her rural seat in Norfolk County.
The film, which serves as a Christmas wish, also revealed the successor to Prince Charles's throne with Camilla's wife.
The photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June at the Ascot racing.
Charles, who has a cylinder on her head and on his face, helps Camille put on her clothes colored with light dresses.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berb a million for his title, hard guy denied it.
Prague - Criminists in the current corruption bail allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former Vice-President of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr had received a million crowns from Prague Slavie for a league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed about the server efotbal.cz with the fact that he got to a part of the police files.
President of the Board of the Warsaw Club, Jaroslav Kleík said that no corruption negotiations had been committed in July.
The server published a copy of the police wires, in which Slavie mainly presents her former sports director Jan Niemar, who ended last summer in the master club.
Some of the more powerful red-and-white shareholders were in frequent contact with Berbra, and with former sports director at that time, the secondary Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who was also in the case of the accused.
Criminists reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbr promised her financial reward for getting his title.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Praha title in the first league.
The police authority had a knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should have a million-year-old from the shareholders of SK Slavia Prague, quoted the server from the file for winning the league.
A day later, according to the CSIs, Berb was met not only with Nemar, but also with the chairman of the Board of Directors Slavie Hardík.
The file further does not indicate whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The hard-on of any corruption hearing refused.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the ratios in Czech football and offered a offensive alternative to its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, have not sought to influence the referee against the rules of fair play, and we have not provided any financial performance in this context,” said the Reporter.
Among other things, Nimar does not choose to insult some of Slavie's former dark skin players, and also speaks to his former boss Hardík.
The Kauzu alleged influence of matches through the referee took place in the middle of October in several locations, including the FACR Prague headquarters.
The highest built in afire is Berbr, which no longer configured in any of the football functions.
In the middle of January, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz released from custody.
The helicopters, tanks, and bvp are the larping of the Cold War.
It will be new, but in principle it will be worse (the shooters must be of the armored cabin and hand-held ammunition).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, and in addition, Prague V3S has already managed to get rid of its V3S as well as special units.
Aircraft: fighting- decent, but at the end of renting, transport - very small with short lower left but modern.
drones - few and only small types without fighting potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got a story like this.
I got a honitbu right next to town.
The rivers were a nutrie, and they were doing crop damage, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the river bank.
I didn't want to do a mess, so I sat down peacefully, and I guess this guy didn't notice.
I was hoping he'd leave before he could figure something out, but, of course, there was a fox in there for a while.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, he had a lead on all sides, so I called him that it was on the fox.
Before I got off the seat, he was gone.
And a man's meadow is a pain in the ass.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the sum of a lot of coincidences to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So, to a visible place, dear things get data to their feet in the spacek, and you should be fine.
The soldiers of Vers Hamáček.
Vnitro has found respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for purchasing and distributing rouse, masks and respirators for professions closest to Coravir, has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iSloud compared the purchase of individual ministrys and found that in one day the amounts to the respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved in the economy?
And why were others shopping for the yard?
Lenka Kabrehel is talking to the server editor and voted by Dominika Kubrišt.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (as I am not affected by the memories of the Czech Republic, which have undergone the older generation), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory military.
We don't even have much of a piece of technique that practice can take care of, we don't actually have modern techniques for existing professionals, and the modern technology is still more difficult, so the capacity of the Founders will be rationally wasted in time.
To this modern conventional conflict, where anyone can put is going to play very fast will not be the time to practice someone again.
And eventually, depositors/territory defenses have great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where they are going to lead a mass gerilla, and it is also the necessary to remove the enemy.
In the Czech Republic there will only be a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where Gerila will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geographicity.
We don't have an individual ski.
It's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have it.
Then find such a situation that you look like a loser who didn’t hit an empty gate two minutes ago, comes into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say, “twort, and what you think is going to happen now”.
Well, of course, they're taking him like a average tax payer.
The situation with this skoll - flooding the defender - it's so horrible that I'm really surprised to see that our attacker managed to cover one player's opponents.
First liner
The Covid pandemic slows down, but experts do not expect any major twist for the following weeks.
In hospitals according to statistical models, there is still some time to stay and to the pandemic equation it has arrived as it is known, the new unknown: the Omikron variant, which is very likely spreading faster than the currently overseeing Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of course, in any case it helps with vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by previous damage.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon entered the covid equation on the plus side: possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, an antivirotism of Molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation of the third period and can be treated at home.
And soon, it should also be added to a lexlud drug from Pfizer, which is reported by 85 percent success.
The first shipment of mollnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of extending the portfolio of instruments useful in the fight against coronavir pandemics, highlighted the question of how the administration prepared for incoming medicines.
As said, the first to local patients will receive Molnupiravir from Merck.
The company ended up on the band first and because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic broke out in order to find appropriate treatment for viral diseases for horses on the South American continent.
In these research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) often forget that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and openly not sharing their views.
For the Eastern Europeans, and in particular we Czechs, we are used to speak - as we grew up to speak -
See if you can do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will tell you no.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how they should all help them, and how we Czechs are racist.
And then they go and vote sides like AfD.
He's afraid of being a cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, West Good, starting bad.
But they'll find out really what people think.
They only have over 20% in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura.
We even know that objects are in Czech three and completely identical.
The same for turning forces so that soldiers don't have to learn where what is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is Atom Museum Brda and the remaining two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that ssr didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, whether because of safety or speed of head deployment due to the western position.
In these underground shelters (there are two in each map) only warheads not all rockets as they are called.
If you needed to put this weapon down, there was a special unit that picked up this warhead and set it up on some nose device.
Besides the museum maple, they're left in a desolent state.
At the second level of primary school, we had a classmate Cigana, four years we were with him.
He was pretty cool, he was doing good jokes, he often showed up too much, but it was our mascot.
He was having fun with him, often walking around, wanting to explain something, missing little, going on a regular basis, sporting with us, not stealing snacks, or telephones, walking cleanly away.
He also drove to school in nature, made various monkeys, but he was fine, maybe never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, there were siblings, ciganes in the same year, different classes.
Shortly, they beat up a teacher, talked about police around there often, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to ad (old things, something I don't need, etc) and I've been selling to Cignians a lot, money always had, they didn't try to get me to price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called in a month, he's already put it on himself.
I'm talking about myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if anyone's white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, until he's acting the way he's in a decent society (working, working, women don't kill, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he pulls his hand, leaves the flats and houses, he's got a mess around him, he's making problems, so he doesn't care what color he's wearing, but he's gonna bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start to business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care if they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be theirs.
Young woman died in a car crash on Prahatick
“The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she claimed her injuries on the spot,” said the speaker of South Bohemia health professionals Zuzana Fajtlová.
The crash was probably caused by a driver who was driving a girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably in the direction from the village Žechec to the town of Bavorov and, from the unknown causes, he went out in the turn to the counterway.
After the crash with Skoda Octavia, a vehicle of Peugeot ended on a roof outside of the vehicle, described the accident by a spokesperson of South Bohemia Pěpánka Schwarz.
Young driver Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a number of injuries, and it was stuck in the cart.
After extortion, he had to be provided with acute pre-munscriptive care, and in a stable state he had been transported to the Czech-based hospital, the rescue officer Fajtlová was in place.
She added that the second-car male suffered a minor chest injury and was transferred to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them.
Luke Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly making collector cards.
“It can usually be tens of dollars, let’s say, from ten dollars higher, where it is still paid for, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free,” approaches the collector.
Since October, the order for small consignments has been slightly expensive, new VAT must be added and the post office must transmit the information to the customs procedure.
He'll find an e-mail with a message that the customs are expecting the package's arrival.
Then it is sufficient to fill out the information on the consignment, and if the VAT did not include the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount per consignment and for transport.
Where the address does not provide itself for customs proceedings, the total amount shall also be added to the carrier's remuneration.
According to Luke Neuheisla, but the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna lock one or two landing boxes, put two attachments in, and I'm done.
It's mostly five minutes for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all consignments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the number of consignments received from abroad has fallen to the international post in Prague from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for data delivery that are needed to complete customs proceedings.
There are currently 30,000 consignments on the international post, which we have to process.
If people had filled out all the data they needed and filled them in time, we would have been here mid-term, reports the spokesperson of the Czech Post Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose solutions to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% inflation and are expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow this growth down or compensate?
We see, in Poland, a reduction in the VAT on food and PHM, a path for you?
What do you think is gonna happen, what's inevitable about where it's going to go?
Prices grow faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get to add (who's employee)?
I was added to 2% this year in gross, which is a laugh, but luckily, I have a similar income from the business that I operate during my job.
Would someone be able to explain to me why the violent ones are sending themselves behind bars for just six months?
This just doesn't take my head off, how the court can send that animal to six months behind bars just so he can do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to his/her victim having trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships overall.
And not to mention that the rape victim never needs to remember it again.
Won't this even be a potential victim rape report?
A man from Hruba “fired ” his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hruba helped the guards to ensure his full-time-looking girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom the arrest warrant was issued.
Because he called them to her himself.
He went to it with a window.
First, he approached the walking man and came up with a story that he was robbed.
After calling on the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene, and did not appear to be surprised when the alleged “circumcised” told them that they had made up all their mind to bring the officers to their place.
In fact, he just wanted to advise officers on how he was supposed to make a announcement at the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that a woman was on the target list, in a national investigation, and was given an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore addressed by the CRS.
A honest question for people here, do you consider our country a Slovak?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with me, of course, the pity that Churchill was unable to provide the release of Prague USA :'
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slovak language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question whether a rational person can actually trust anything completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree here with Pascal, there's an estimate in the world if I'm wrong, something about ten thousand different religions.
What god or Gods will you choose?
I would say that it is likely that there is at least one god in any of these thousands of religions who will not punish you if you believe in God another.
But even in the decade, there is no god but Jahve.
Wouldn't it be more rational to keep faith in any god than to risk taking out the thousands of gods wrong and the one real god I just didn't hit, send me to hell or some kind of place like that?
Other: Free training with subsequent inclusion in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of profesors with practical experience.
If you could do well, you could get a professional offer.
This would be the case with all the APR files.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak this way: It is constantly slowing the cooperation between the educational sector and industry, the companies fishing in schools and a certain flooding takes place when the labour force migrations from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when you grow up, but this process is ongoing constantly, each one of us learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
A similar curse should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between citizens and the army, i.e. institutions that guarantee that Russia, Germany, or, like, Mongolia's rider will never come here again.
I find it funny what you think of NATO as something carved into the stone, we have allies, and these will defend us if there's a breakthrough.
Oh, well, please, lord.
Just one choice in the U.S. that cuts their budget and NATO's whole thing goes to hell.
The English will replace us with Russian money, the Germans will replace us with Russian gas, and the Poles have shown themselves once again that they need to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works for a long time as a guarantee of loneliness is a armed army and a people who can control military technique of their time.
And today he can fly remote control every teenager, so what it wouldn't be.
We don't need border restraints, that's bullshit today, but a full-blown teenager behind the thumb of a remote control device can handle it.
How to not drown in box tsunami
You pack gifts under a Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home with boxes and fillings?
This ‘waste’ is once again used by e-shops that are missing packaging materials.
This is why a map of shops that will welcome your used box.
And it's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to maintain repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as one-off waste.
Anyone can bring them into a involved store (the KAMSNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard box, plastic or paper filler.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid crowded blue containers.
Businesses themselves welcome packagings that are currently in the market of lack and also saved money, as the packaging cardboard has been scratched by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecological-minded customers, in addition, I am strengthening my brand.
One of such shops is TIERRA VERDE, the manufacturer of eco drugs and eco cosmetics.
Krabice and filling material to us in Popůvek near Brno by individuals who gather at home, however, are also referred to companies with whom we have scheduled regular carriages.
We'll use everything in packing the package from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve resources and beauty of nature by another generation, says Petra Lopusníková from Tirry.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling sites for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine, if you need anything to get rid of (where you can remove the stolen waste from the household, where to issue powder drugs, tyres, e-mails, batteries, light sources, large-scale waste, etc.).
All wastes can thus end up in the right place, in addition to the reuse of things, they will find their second home.
The total map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
“The collection courts, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity malls, SWAPs and other places to help find use for things that would otherwise have become waste” is supplied by Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from Ukliďme Česko.
I think it's bad that technology is so simple and stupid that kids who use a computer or phone are playing games at it today, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem ( mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principles of ingredients on their computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or actually mobile phones are simply hiding this underlying filesystem with files and everything goes to one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique since childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's get back to history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron introduced the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he discovered the Presidency's logo, called for Europeans to be protected at work, on the street, and mentioned so many actions that they could not be held in six months.
The French politicians love it so much, and they like it as well as voters.
Macrons supporting the spread between the right and the left agree to a few, but right in Europe.
And in France, there will be a new election of the Heads of State in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe,” and France is prepared to create conditions for historians to do so.
A number of commentators have just advanced with criticism that Macron is about pro-European propaganda and translates history.
In fact, it's trying to defend history.
The national right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmmour is currently coming to France with the idea that the scheme from Vichy, which in the Second World War he co-organised with Hitler, was not so bad, and has been quite successful with the French.
Let's try and take Macron's idea of one history textbook seriously and let's not look at events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn from history as the story of us versus they and never as a story of whole.
Spanish, French, Czechs will find out who defeated in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantora, they won't know what a broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?

Trains start riding according to a new timetable, somewhere the carriers change.
Since Sunday, they start riding trains on the railways according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ustím nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet begins to ride instead of the Czech Railways.
For most lines only the departure time will be adjusted, or slightly their route.
Ten new trains will also be on the tracks.
During the fall, carriers started selling tickets.
The Czech Railways are planning to change traffic services on average 6783 daily on a new timetable, from which it will be on average 478 motorway trains daily.
Trains run around 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
The roads next to national connections under the new timetable will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company together with the new timetable will place dozens of new trains.
InterJet trains will be the main news, which will ride on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Another new trains of the carrier will be carried out in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will traditionally increase the fare by 3.2 percent on average from next year.
Drugs take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the line R23 Clear above Labem - Mělník - Nyburk - Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
There will be 16 connections on the line daily, eight in every direction.
Other changes relate to the remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at Havlíčkův Brod stations, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express has maintained his 16 connections, two return connections in Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep its distance trains as much as possible.
Without major changes, Arriva and other carriers should continue to operate as well.
The carrier shall also be traded in certain regional lines.
The changes await passengers for example on Czechoslovakia, where on the line from Mladá Boleslavi via České Lípu to Rumburk, there will be a place of Czech roads to drive the trains Trilex of the German company Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use a single railway ride for the second year.
As with the Czech Drags, their price increases by 3,2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn to look the other way?
We can hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and they had to work, they died.
In my life, I have not heard a slave party teaching, or from that time, no one defends this, but condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that black people often sold black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, but they will tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans have killed themselves, while they have killed each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly at schools, both in the north and in the south.
I didn't see anyone talking about the facts deliberately, but I've heard before that it's happening, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it.
My point was that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what he is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat it again.
By the way, when we're already with those Southern states, yes, the confederation flag and the famous slavery there are quite popular, on the other hand, even they had some good success and it came to me absurdly to reject them.
Besides, North wasn't much better off how many people idealize him these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in South were slavemen, and a lot of things happened to them too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, deliberately leave some facts, lie and manipulate, even if our view does not exist with them (on YT there was also a video from television, where someone who started talking about our legalists and 1968).
What came to my US schools ridiculous was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never experienced their country.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities, it was shocking, these students were pretty betrayed and those schools supported them.
And if I imagine these people are going to be a lot older someday, then I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because there's a lot of young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has already reached what he had, and it's not about the same thing, it's betrayed himself.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the fundamental biological facts, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation even on the other side, when it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Besides, the more radical it is, the more it is to hear it.
Anyway, I didn't see anyone judging me for colonism or slavery either.
More like I met the wrong country, it was but both:
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
I'm supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
Moreover, the concept of nationality is generally considered unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If there's something that brings me to people's interests, world views and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not believers, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has a record of theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks up some cocooter about the Coravir that everyone's ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Church of Czechoslovakia.
Officially, they're Protestants, but they're actually born of Catholic modernity, and they're actually catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they're in the service of densers because it's theologically much similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanic Street.
Otherwise, St. Michal's church on Dominican square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they make mass in Latin as she did before the Vatican II.
The beach from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav, the Plamínek, in Bethlehem, where, according to the Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Skauti took it from their Austrian colleagues to the Reintal border crossing, Břeclav, for him because of the Cropavir pandemic but not this time.
She was transferred to the border last year.
Betlémský light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate with the section every year, I look forward to the power.
It's an honor for me to have been chosen, told the journalists present the Scout Amálie Budíková.
While the transmission took place last year at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually for him, the Scouts are driving the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes to the development of the flame after the Czech Republic.
With the betlemian light, the skits had gone by traditionally train to Brno, where they would hand it over to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, December 18, the Scout couriers, who will travel with selected speeds and passenger trains, will take care of the follow-up of the light.
From them, the light will take over at stations of local Scouts or volunteers who will continue to spread flames to the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, Scouts must follow valid measures against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both these courier teams and local events organizers to, of course, wear bugs, try to keep their distances, they were at least, not singing colleagues, just act as safe as possible, describe the spokesperson events of the Tibetan light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bellém Light, which flows Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
At the same time, the goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol for the believers of hope, the light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Scouts have been looking for its spread for over 30 years.
The event stands on hundreds of volunteers, so flames are also a symbol of insecurity and human intercession.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on www.betlemsvetlo.cz website.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that subsidies are economic cancer, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education is making good use of this money, but I don't understand why money is put into agriculture, industry and overall businesses.
As mentioned above, the unnecessary product is manufactured and it is hacking the free market and the natural life of the company -
I work in a factory where there is a million pieces in the corridors--xy funded/co-financed by a project xy-- and this company is just artificially held in life.
This isn't the company's support that gives work to x people, this is the development gap when this company keeps up and collects business contracts that could grow and be more productive after its disappearance.
Totally agreeable, it's terrible.
Sometimes even the person born at the Internet time will also get caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think Internet ads are gonna move with me, but then I get the same idea that they've affected me too - it's just so tired that you don't always get away with it.
I also support, for this reason, radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently want to give the total ban on the programmematic (= targeted) advertisements...

2. “I will not believe everything the media says,”
3. - I don't trust politicians -
TVs have gone through the Christmas film trend, the premieres have two hundred of them this year.
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English speaking countries have lost the trend of Christmas films and this year their audiences in the premium will present a record of more than two hundred.
It consisted of an IMDb film database operator.
The poet of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years points at the audience and significantly increases the ratings, so these images are becoming more and more.
Four times more Christmas films were recorded this year than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only the images that have the word Christmas in its name in its sum, so it will indeed be a lot more on holiday films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, in particular fairy tales are associated with this period, worldwide are also popular images of the House, Love Sky or Classic Christmas Story Life is a beautiful story from 1946.
A true boom of Christmas pictures, but it started in 2009, when a special film series came in American cable television station Hallmark, reminded the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Recaling until Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began its audience at Christmas to be painting on October 22th and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime Competition Station has 35 new Christmas themes this year and also the popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total sum.
“In this magical period of story it doesn’t matter so much, it’s important that in the background there are many Christmas trees and that it snows,” he described this genre Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas Films called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I’ll be home on Christmas videos).
“It’s a form of escape for audiences and a way to feel a little peace in the middle of all this holiday madness and madness of the world in which we’ve been living for the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, will seem to be resolved and these two will kiss.
That's how it's always around, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one another, complement Gray.
Mazepine had a positive text on covid-19, and it will not reach F1 in the final race.
Only 19 riders will go to the Great Prize of Abu Zabí in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not reach the last season race.
I'm going to go to the track with only one formula.
In the last season, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th yarn he took out in the qualifier.
However, the Russia of Nikita Mazepin from the state of Haas will not eventually reach the Great Prize of Abu Zabie.
He was positively tested for covid-19.
There will be only 19 cars on the starting grill, from the last line will be on the track of Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who is in direct battle by title with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepine is relatively normal according to the expression of the Haas stable and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with security as a final priority for all interested parties,” said its representatives for formulaa1.com.
He can't even send a replacement rider to Haas's race.
A potential alternate would have to graduate qualifications or driving in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 does not deal with the first racer.
At the start of the season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year were positive tested Sergio Pérez no Lewis Hamilton.
You can be arrested for this, too.
And everyone's gonna be stolen saying the boss.

Honey, silver and 150 diamonds: The price list of the most expensive sweater is huge!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and a creator put six months of work in it and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home, the sweaters had never been much, ” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours in six months.
Hedwab bought in Italy, 24karat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals supplied Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk supplies the hebctic sweater,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, is not recommended to prate.
And it's got one more catch.
“I am completely broke, I must sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he creates a world record.
The present most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, stood “only 720 000 crowns.

The government has approved the sending of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have Polish colleagues to help protect the border with Belarus and to build a planned fence.
Poland has officially asked NATO States to help, in connection with several months of ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime, which in its territory invites citizens of Middle East countries with a false promise of easy crossing the EU's border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active in the Polish territory.
The Omikron mutation spreads south of Moravia?
Hygien is investigating another case of a child from Adam's.
“We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another Adam’s child, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Czech Republic Adamov is not demonstrated,” Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the country last week.
“For the official confirmation of the variants in our six cases, we are still waiting,” said the National reference laboratory for flu and non-silver viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague, said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one workplace at the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, and two 11-year-old pupils from ZS Adamov.
There's no connection between Brno and Adam's cases.
Three of them, according to the principal, have mild symptoms, four unidentifiable course.
No one suspected of Omikron in a foreign country has ever lived
None of these have lived abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have any contact with anyone who could live abroad.
There is no link to the championship at the water pole, and Ciupek said.

California will restrict the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas when he prohibits abortion.
Governor Kalifornie Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on selling and producing certain weapons in the United States by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-carriage law following the detection of the heart rate embryo.
People should then be entitled to compensation in action by anyone who manufactures or sells attack rifles and a subspace made by firearms.
The notification of Newsoma responded to the fifth opinion of the United States Supreme Court, which left the Texas ban on abortion in force, which is against almost 50 years of old precedent, which has determined the right to abortion across the United States in approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical question that arises from the innovative structure of the measures.
In this case, extortion of the ban was transferred to the public, which the Texas Republicans prevented its assault by the ordinary court.
“I am more upset by the decision of the United States Supreme Court yesterday, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortional services and to largely supported the Texas Mantel to protect its law,” said the California Governor.
\"If now states can block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human lives,\" News continues.
He said that in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice they worked on measures that would justify the public's representative to enforce the prohibition of attack rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
This is the way they are referred to as a subset of firearms which do not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulation.
Newsom wants them to have “private citizens - the right to require a compensation of at least $100,000 (over CZK 220 000) and a court statement from anyone who would produce, distribute, sell or sell attack rifles, components to“bring up spirits - or set for their production.
“If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons out of our streets is to create a threat of private action, we should do so,” said the California Governor.
The AP Agency notes that California has banned the production and sale of certain weapons of military style for decades, in June but the federal judge here blocked the ban as anti-stop.
Unless the State has actually renewed the ban on the use of the Texas template, the words of the liberal members of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayare, which, in an uncontested opinion, warned the Friday majority of the verdict before the extension of the legal mechanism to other American states, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas has not recognised the full immunity against the judicial review and has allowed abortion clinics to continue the action against the selected actors of the South State of the United States.
Every emergency vaccination has its public test phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like and also improve the vaccine itself on the basis of the results.
Maybe Izrael is already in a large scale study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to five times the increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect.
Just like any other vaccination is going to have its vaccination schedule after a while, it's just too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should come to the market on the basis of an inactivated virus which, according to the specifications of the manufacturer, promises up to 10x greater efficiency.
The quantity can be left.

Poland has threatened to stop payments into the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it took advantage of new powers and the legal dispute had stopped paying Poland's money.
The Commission has already withdrawn the approval of the Polish plan for drawing up EUR 36 billion from the Union Fund for the recovery of the economy affected by the Cvid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to continue and apply a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries which violate the principles of the rule of law.
\"Police should respond to this blackmail by the EU in all matters that require unanimity,\" said Ziobro, the head of the small part of Solidarity Poland, without its voices, the current government would lose a tight majority in the country.
\"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy leading to a drastic increase in energy prices,\" Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified, given that the EU is unlawfully denying the resources from the common budget, which we also contribute to, the Polish Minister has added.
Its party is more radical than the governing Party of law and justice in access to the EU.
According to the European Commission, the changes that have passed the Polish justice for Ziobrov’s action threaten its independence and undermines it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels builds “the impossible conditions because its objective is not a rule of law, but a change in the government in Poland -
Warsaw is facing “political dictatorship by blackmailing and undermining the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on the partnership of sovereign states and not on the governments of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never come to such a withdrawal of Brussels, which would result in the sovereignty of Poland being limited.
“We will never agree with Poland’s status of colony,” he said.
But to learn about it... there's one kind of cheese in Ledla at four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yogurt more times, I needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk regals, I resigned and asked.
They had him, that's true, there were all selected, less common and special cheeses in the narrow sector, but it was between the vegetables and the larynx zone...
If it goes away, I don't even want to go to any market, action non-action, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have a choice, but they usually have everything I need and have a order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching it load up here with data like shit, most of the casters of vaccination are just a little more out of the bowl than most of the captors of vaccination.
Although a rational discussion takes place at expert level, there are only extreme views in public space.
From the wall to the wall all the time.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.

But that the data collection methodology is different in these two states.
Ugh, so I'm relieved.
Sorry for the relief and have a good day for you all.
In my childhood, they punished me with a bag.
It was never because of the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (she read instead of going to bed, she was fighting with her brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a wound (even after another time, even after another \"worship,\" she brought only a bag and put it in such a way that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few shots on my ass.
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
I think it's important that part of the warning is important because it gives the child his choice whether he won't listen and get better or he won't be punished.
At the end of the day, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defence
When a major Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered the journalistic question of what the Czech Constitution means to him - whether the sacred Charter, to which she swears and to which she learns in school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, certainly came to the first concept.
We once agreed on democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are and his citizens, and with changes, it is better to save them.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Like the Czechs like pork and vegetables, the question of Vojtěch Cepl was answered at that time.
In recent times, however, the view that the Czech Constitution needs changes is increasingly common among lawyers.
The summer is being tested by situations which her creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example, the conduct of a elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
All we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can be the key to mastering the majority of crises that society meets across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of government consisting of rules that lay down the policies of mantinely games.
We fear that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so politics is bound by bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they're fighting for the lives of a couple of months' baby
Although the Coravirus is known to be milder to children, there will also be difficult cases faced by hospitals most recently.
“We know that children are threatened and affected by less than adults, they speak about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said the New Mayor of the Children’s Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty of Medicine Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The course is much easier, lighter, often done without symptoms.
But they are children's patients who are sick with Coravir, which we see in particular during the last period, said Dominika.
According to a doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild support.
That happens at the children's infection clinic.
Very serious children with coronavir are only recently in the ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes have been at the medical department on a continuous basis throughout the year.
\"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia, which requires a stay on resuscitation bed,\" he said and added that this disease interferes with both adults and adolescents, as well as a few months old babies.
In hospitals children are also in a difficult state because of coronavir.
“Now we have a child of several months and adolescent age,” said the prime minister.
However, he is pleased that no children's deaths have been recorded in the children's hospital of FN Brno.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 had died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to the Dominican Republic, she is in a children's hospital, not just at the Corravir Department, an integral part of her cooperation as a psychologist.
At the same time, it also points out that as in adults, as well as in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
“For this, we recommend the administration of the vaccine in children,” the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk around marked paths.
But those peaceful zones aren't that big.
They are seen on the tourist map on map.cz.
In general, in national steam outside the peaceful zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't go through fences to the giants).
Ski/Go to bikes in the woods outside the marked path must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but, of course, it does not look so much outside national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music goes in my head, laughs at Josef Kurfiřt.
He's a alienated by the liberal opera and originally played on the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically all the cinemataries and as a conductor works not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Maddy, but also in Pilsen, in the Theatre of Josef Kajetán Tyla.
He cooperates with the castle Philharmonic, with the film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonosian symphonic orchestra.
China builds the impression of managed disease and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China builds the impression of managed disease and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better.
China went to medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing rejected criticism for unable to stop the disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in the infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors, have often helped combat the Coravir, for example, in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing's willingness?
Is it a friendly support or a communist regime trying to improve its picture in the world?
He's gonna meet a friend of mine, and he's like, hey, you don't want an elephant?
I got him and he's great.
My wife likes it because she's gonna save the grass, wash the car with a chobot, and the kids are playing with him.
Well, that's great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
A friend: All right, let's do it, it's gonna be great...
After some time they meet, and the one who's complaining about it, what did you sell for the elephant?
The man who's broken up, he's got a giant shit everywhere, and he's got a car crash, and the kids are fighting him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
He said, \"You're not talking about an elephant, you're not going to sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by power.
Although the equality of sovereign states is true, they are the powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become so powerful if it works on its integration.
This is so far working at economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work out.
I thought about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in the Czech language, so maybe I can say a word.
I'm just based on the fact that ellipse usually involves two different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment - Spanish oranges and Mandarins - when it is clear that it is both Spanish and Spanish fruit and mandarins - already with Mandarins it is not clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I assume that the sentence is “all US forces, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in this broad concept and it is not necessary to further specify it with US forces.
But again, maybe I'll just say, \"D.\"
Either way, it's a pointless request.
A 5-degree earthquake was recorded in Tokyo.
Japan's Tokyo Metropolis and the surrounding area on Sunday hit an earthquake with a force of 5.0 degrees.
Witnesses have reported that buildings were quiet in the capital, but no damage has been reported so far.
No warnings were issued in front of the cuns, reported to Reuters.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured thepes of space Milly
Scary shots show the moment when the fearless monkey bled in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed it and laughed at her.
Holland's monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her actual dietary needs.
The Magistrate Court of Gwen has now banned her from breeding animals, informed the Sun.
Experts for the rehabilitation of the monkeys who are after Milly's abuse have said that they've never seen such a scared alien before.
Milly spent almost two years of rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she's playing happy again with another saved monkey named Moon.
A four-time mother confessed to two accusations caused by unnecessary suffering from a protected animal.
In the Magistrate Court of Gwen, her sentence was imposed on her twelve weeks of imprisonment with conditional delay for one year.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has received a lifeless ban on animal farming and has to pay 12 000 crowns of judicial costs.
Head of the Small Monkeys Team, who had been rehabilitated by the accused animal, Steph Savyer said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue.”
Milly insisted on getting used to people again.
She was bleeding and hiding from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat and eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled down and happy with the male, she can still get a panic on new people.
Psychic scars from abuse will guide her forever, supplying Sayyer.
Milly's TV showed up after the Gwent police discovered scary shots in the woman's phone once in her apartment for drug charges.
The footage can be heard that Milly's giving vulgarianly.
On the next video, it is heard Holland's monkey offers cocaine and says: “You want cocaine -
So lick my fingers.
In May with her partner Russell Cox (43) she admitted to holding cocaine with her intention to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for £1,600 (in the count of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was then arrested for 30 months and Holland received a conditional penalty 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this great first time three times in yourself when you bravely jump over the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same thing you did in class six?
And all this kills the idea of bluffing, when no one, the honor of an exception, doesn't care if you know it or understand it.
Just write a test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go on and on the street with random people ask if you can determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through this, and the absolute majority won't even cut off, and they'll tell you they're totally in the oven.
So what the fuck is this all about?
I'm a big fan of a general overview, and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that point, it's unnecessary, and you'll never get it.
Part of it's been taught for a lot of people who need that thing.
But, like, the note that you don't really need all this stuff on the machine, I mean completely serious... because you just don't need to.
Besides, we're slowly getting to a time when they don't know them's a punk sign.
(which is probably part of our communist past and angry against educated and elites) but the price of the fact that there will be barbarics in these machines is simply high.
If the journalists could count, they probably never reached those dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: the war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason that Switzerland cannot leave right away,” said Andrea on the Instagram in Stories to all questions of curious fans who so disappointed her that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, it's been closed since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move behind her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she refused to.
And as it is seen, their relationship not only does it not end with love, but rather has grown in one another’s disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He was upset with the turnover of Kadri in response to Andre's charges on lies, gabblery and debt.
The particular honesty of Kadri has not liked his younger sister Linda any more.
She decided to publicly suspend her brother.
Normally, I'm not talking about this stuff at all, and we've never even been very extra in the family.
I don't want to make any regrets.
But when I see someone who's trying to publicly hurt and spy on someone I love so much, he's just not gonna give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this way, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri in this public for making himself a character and helping our family as much as we needed it, even though he was a young age.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information, which are probably quite out of context.
I wish I could all have known Kadri as I, our close and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what they say, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him over everything, and we know the reality, and we know what it really was, have given it to indeterminately.
A drunk thief went up after a fascist to the fifth floor.
You're not gonna believe what it's for.
He started his robbery expedition at Cchao in the parking lot in the residential district where he tried to get into several cars.
Finally, according to the information available, from one vehicle to another, it cut off less than CZK 330.
Then he didn't think of anything better than climb up to the fifth floor and climb into the apartment in the open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The security footage from one security camera is then caught leaving the street away from the crime scene and eating bananas.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were, and called the police.
That's why Ccha was holding up.
A man confessed to drinking alcohol in a criminal day.
And given that he needed money, he decided to buy in the drunk.
So far, the whole thing is in the investigation.
The monkey went up to the fifth floor where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and effective in relation to the Pandemic Emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't be effective.
While the law limits the scope of the business
Isn't that enough for you?
The right to collect will be limited but not cancelled.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilians or foreign politicians?
I think that's all you people know right here.
You're just playing stupid so you can deal with--
If not, it's sad.
I do not say that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from aesthetic perspective (which ultimately was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care what they believe in.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had in the Middle Ages how much money she had to replace, suppress science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars that caused, for example, the 30-year-old.
Tl;dr: Believe yourself in a spy monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
A man fell head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava who was involved in rescue services of the regional Health Service.
The personnel of the Regional Operation Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight's distress call with initial information about the fall of the man from the height.
Two ZZS crews left the station immediately - medical and medical.
When they arrived at the medical station, they found that a seven-year-old man was supposed to fall off the window from a height of about twelve meters and fall head to concrete!
The Vitkovice caught coal.
But not as it should, and firemen went into action.
At the time of arrival, the rescue teams were unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervener had activated his respiratory path, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and following other measures in the pre-residue care of his ambulance vehicle transported to further care of the Australian trauma center, informed the spokesperson of the MS Region, Luke Humpl.
I'm more concerned than I have from the Coravir inadvertent public reactions and authorities

Legendary Nunes after seven years fell, Oliveire defensed the belt
MMA experienced a wonderful galaxy full of interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peňa has been able to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found the supporter for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate in a light vase, demonstrated a great squeezing against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The winner also recorded Kai Kara-France, who quickly trashed Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's struggle with the bantam weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Juliana Peňa.
The American entered into a battle together as a thoughtless “traper, Nunes, for seven years she did not lose, and she was mutilating her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her trip to win a lot, and the opponent even gave her a push kick that she sent her to the ground.
However, the October did not allow any other error to be made, and it failed to attack by using the lever to the hand.
The second round was staggering, and for the fans of MMA, it was very naive.
Both rivals were in a lot of excellent strikes and heavy hooks.
In addition, Nunes got to the ground where she started to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock the attack.
The American so prepared a huge shock when she became a new champion.
There was a battle between Charles Olive and Dustin Poirier in the battle in light.
At first, however, Poirier managed better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the other, he tried to be more active, Oliveira, who tried to catch his hand with the opponent.
He did not do so much, but then he made a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and put him in a number of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear of the hamster, to whom Poirier had turned up for a while, but then he had to knock off the scrapping.
Brazilian so advocated the title, Poirier lost two years after.
In the next match he signed Sean O'Malley's sovereign triumph, who was already on Rauliana Paiv's hard back in the first round.
He subsequently finished him with a series of precise impacts and recorded the 15th triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she's lost seven years.
I mean, the hip or the hip?
It's not complicated at first sight.
Most important names in Czech only express one grammatical family, and therefore there is no problem in determining whether it is a male, female or middle family.
Then there is also a relatively large group of essential names with no permanent birth.
Such important names fluctuate between two families.
Then there are two concoctes, and in some cases they remain in unreflected form.
For example, the words “light, ” or“ shew, are male and female, and the first one tends to be “the system” according to the pattern “the song“ in the second line.
For other groups of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, e.g.: “brembor/brambor” (in the meaning of food).
Both shapes, however, are of equal importance and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example, ‘orientate’, in Bohemia and ‘rkure’, in Moravia, but in this case, the Moravian variant is unscriptural, similar to the other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: ‘kopop’, ‘cobliha’ and ‘coblih’ etc.
Some words that have penetrated from other languages have originally been inconclusive, but they gradually take over Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression “image, which is a male and female family, or the word “bufet, which remained in the middle of the family in the middle, but has limbs according to the “grod” pattern.
Turkey opened its way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like on the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkey border because of the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to go to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece support, humanitarian assistance is also planned by the Czech government.
What actually motivates refugees to an insecure path?
And what's the situation in place?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months, and we've been choked, described by a journalist from Sydney.
The destructive fires with which Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozens of people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have destroyed millions of hectares of soil.
How do the authorities and the citizens themselves cope with the disaster?
Could the Prime Minister Morrison have done more to avoid drastic effects, as the critics say?
And what about climate change will the country have to prepare for the future?
Lenka Kabrehel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ikou Detrich.
False charges have always been and are very rare.
That's why they always write about everyone everywhere.
It's hard for people to figure out what sexual violence looks like in our society and how much spread it is, so they're trying to talk it out.
I don't know personally anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped, and I've seen how often they're treated around them or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
Trends finally open up for their traumas.
But he still keeps too many people to himself.
Yes, there are also those who falsely blame someone.
It is ugly and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “the great part of the charge is thought - and that it is “treend” - you only help sex offenders.
Czech Republic flooded houses, families don't have money to complete
Construction material prices in recent weeks and months increased by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people have gotten into a holy situation because of it.
For she has no means to complete her family home and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the material prices, the price of construction works is increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to complete their family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating an extremely unpleasant situation.
In a better way, people move into a built-in and unwarranted home.
In worse cases, uninhabitable homes are built, and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off mortgages and pay rents to do so,\" says Economy BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two or three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of it happened to us.
It's hard for us as a building company to keep certain things on contract, even though the material has betrayed us.
So we do without a payoff,” said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Sleivoň.
A lot of people will only have financial problems.
If they're counting on building a house that's going to be worth five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait,” added Slavovin.
From the material the most scratched copper, iron, as well as installation and topener equipment.
Construction companies, however, are also struggling with a lack of labour force.
In the Czech Republic there is a lack of graduate of construction fields and the arrival of foreign workers is hindered by pandemics.
The situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable at this point.
“The authorities in October issued 7 675 building permits, almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” said Křeček.
We're fine, and we'll get better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator ČRO - mujRloud
The entry into the new year, apart from the classic celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by the expressions of politicians.
This year they spoke to the nation in addition to the Prime Minister and President Andrei Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman and the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What is essential?
As the diplomat gets to me, I have my own subject that I have chosen, I've always been working on it all year long, and then in a week to two, I'm writing a written piece.
The state's very calm with us, if you're not a total makeover, and there's something left in his head, so the committee won't be suffocating him to the theory.
Maybe I was studying at the station for a week, and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical ride, which was right for me and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to do this semester project (we did it many times, really beneficial, they will learn a lot) and then they'll just learn the project and get it done.
I think it's cool when at the end of the course, there's a test to prove the knowledge acquired within the project, not just the defence.
All right, but don't waste your e-mails and phones and send no packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as they are.
Those people in the embassy have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise they could have something.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the Pú bear.
Maybe you could just give her a shot of Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though the Insta throws sticks under his feet to artists.
As soon as you don't give a story every day and at least every other day a new picture will be reduced to your absolute minimum.
In addition, the fut changes what a function is more important if a bench, a comment or a deposit.
It's been really hard for me lately, so maybe I'm gonna have to cut myself to a tick, where a lot of artists from my business are successful and don't almost let that happen.
Finally, perhaps I would also like to see something userly warmer coming up, which does not blow all the creativity and energy from the artists
Declaration by the Parties working on Donbas
The ties - yes, broken - no, express their views on the image of the opponents will break the SSSR.
Thirty years from the illegal collapse of the USSR.
On 8 December 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevic, without any legal authority and violation of the results of the referendum on 17 March 1991, with the open attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbačova, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “The SSR Association as an international entity and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
One cut of the pen “disappeared, a vast country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
Tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens were born abroad by the collapse of the USSR.
From the early 1990s, Russia’s population has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Even regardless of the loss of the Russian population of former Soviet Republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who had destroyed what had been built in Belarus for one session in the past 70 years have betrayed the socialist camp (made by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Eastern War).
In fact, they have deindustrialised the agriculture, they have torn off the largest world power of 14 republics, which have previously been economicly associated with the only mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the population’s decline, economic breakdown, science, army, crime growth, interethnic conflicts, war in Chemistry, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, surrendering first to the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as “the activity of power, ”
Everything that has been betrayed and surrendered in a hurry has quickly filled in and conquered NATO countries that have adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And today the whole world is shaken mainly because of the event from the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it with that I'll put it in the fridge and make it Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy it on Monday, its chain will discount it on Tuesday to CZK 99 / kg - will you describe me a mechanism that will make it a mass change in its price to my experience system?
Or I'll wait until Thursday, and that meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption will be reduced to CZK 69 / kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it 3 days in my fridge?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These talk that when something's cheap, it must be guaranteed wrong, corrupt or poor are extremely retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now, recently, I went to Brno to the Head and the ladies gave out some booklets, similar things I always take to help the Brigies, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of Selian senses and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some sort of agility.
After reading, I found out who gave it up and finally came out of scientology.
Well, like it was a good matrache, full of unnecessary lessons, like I'm going to be wrong and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, it wouldn't have to do with the rainforests.
I've seen something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail make this man respect you because you like him without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk out.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried so hard and asked me not to go anywhere.
Then she began physically blocking the door.
Cca year was a great relationship, but then he ran another half year and started to get her on her finger.
Then I ended the relationship with it, I told her I was breaking up and lying to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch up with some amok again.
You're such a person who drains feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are tearing apart by buying a cloud of tests and speeding up positive, who wouldn't be able to test the terrible disease.
All we're getting is a complication for the company, the carrier and another because their employees in the random numbers generator had been in prison for five days.
In the west, they've already stopped the shabby, and they've acknowledged that there's no point in dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something else and drive ego by inventing a book.
I see a good old bastard is coming back to us again.
After several years of silence and repression of this small business, the MLM recruitment again returns to the embodiment.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (it was 20 years old, a freshman at the Czech Republic), the initial promises about the training of products and commercial skills have quickly crossed into, and you do not have to be interested in, especially by the seed of people -
To be honest, I was interested in the products that I offered, because I wanted to help people, but training was more of a man's fear and moan.
When the first money earned came, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to get some certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were only profitable, or did a person feel like a foreign consumer of pots.
But what I can say was a valuable experience, a person learned that he should not jump directly to every tip and information to check closely.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one bag.
There are people in this business that will succeed and even benefit people, but they will certainly not approve of expensive consumer goods or “fatty” accounts.
In a corporation where I've been doing so many things I haven't seen before.
HR is calm, the managers are looking for their management, and they don't put much of their nose on us.
The regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form of what it is going on in us (set some targets for the next year, in a year we'll look at what came out and what didn't) - it's more self-esteem than that someone would judge you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate action is also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company-- there are departments that are more-coordinated--
Sometimes you feel like we're kind of a little bit-starter who's stuck in big corporate offices.
But it doesn't bother us that much while the results are real.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days, the British police continued to search for missing 32-year-old Czechs who were lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the demesia Jakub Kulhánek on social networks that the woman from Uherskohradistsk found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police this afternoon confirmed that they found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not be able to communicate more information on the case.
My condolences, he posted on Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman last saw a bus on the 28th of November on her way out of work, and she was supposed to pick up the money from the ATM before she was posted.
Her disappearance was reported to her colleagues five days later.
Following her, the London police began searching for her, Interpol set her up among the missing people around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this context have already arrested one man a few days ago.
What a role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected of, but didn't publish.
In four municipalities, new representatives of the year were awarded to each other.
On Saturday 11th December, in the village of Komňa in Uherskohradště, Lužice on Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná at Pelhřimsk, the new representative of the region was elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law of a specified number or the elected representative has broken down here.

The average running age was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72 years old.
Working the results of Saturday's elections symbolicly closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
There were squares of new or repeated elections to municipal representatives and, above all, very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in more demanding epidemiological conditions that put greater demands on equipment and personnel security, valued Eva Krupová, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hours.
On Monday, the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we had a pretty dangerous infection at the very beginning, but it went without a bigger tracker.
Dealing with how idiotic a large proportion of the population builds on all its layers, I've got a problem with that right now.
I'm looking forward to vaccination because it makes me finally less dependent on other people being stupid.
It would be removed from the function of the President and the competence to acquire it again.
The chance that this is really going to happen is how the others mention very little here.
Besides, I'm not sure it would be possible for the women to take the file as treason at all.
Vezrada is such an act that the President of the Republic threatens sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic nature of the state.
Must have been more serious.
As pandemic has influenced intimate life: A growing number of people up to 35 years who are without sex all year long
More and more young adults in the US live their lives without sex.
These are mostly religiously based people, reports the DailyMail website.
The study showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people younger than 35 who are making up sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent.
The woman between 18 and 35, who said that they had no sexual relations in the last year, is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to reducing the number of sexually active individuals, showed the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these can be the economic effects of the Cropavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of the media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less a priority.
“From 2010 onwards, men and women from 18 to 35 years of age are rapidly growing, stating that they had no sex in the previous year,” said IFS Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, for 2021 only 5% said that they were in the last year without sex.
Stone added that marriage under 35 was only a small percentage.
In addition, fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contributes to the decline of sexual activity.
Even though it is more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of the married and married younger 35 years is still dropping.
Young people think about premarital sex divides, about 30% thinks it's bad, while about 70% thinks it's okay.
“It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are the minerals, but their behaviour moves this trend,” Stone talks about these 30 percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse are the reason for religious establishment.
Since 2008, free persons under 35 years of age who have attended religious meetings more than one month have increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among “at least believers, the trend has increased from 10 to 20%,” said Stone.
Further factors, such as fewer social interactions and mainly social alcohol drinking during the pandemic, contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason can be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus ‘ replacing this need’
This trend was mainly detected as a blockowne at the time of the coronavir pandemic.
The entire vaccination against covid is about whether the company should force some of the population to conduct, which they don't want, but which can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I'm most interested in in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is whether if we don't get it done and they die, it'll be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have heard some disinformation for the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, and as a result, he didn't get caught and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can do something about bullied and totaliated state for death.
These statistics, as I mentioned, can be quite clearly imported, that most unoccupied pensioners are probably part of the other group, so they will indeed be able to do so on their own.
Czech without snow.
How does a mild winter sign into a fight with a drought?
This summer winter has so far brought one of the smallest snow mines in the Czech Republic for the last time.
Ski resort operators will not come without a technical snow, the weather will also make it difficult to prepare cross-country Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will be little snow for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not the pancake.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across the city on the boat so we could ride the rivers.
On the way there we went one of these pretty wide streets and who we probably don't see in the middle of the Hare Krishna sects.
Of course, we've been blown apart.
Fortunately, I ran away, but one friend and I had a talk.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul,” she replied.
All of them, including teachers, we laughed all the way to the yard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not much to do, but the system's already playing, says Oozovich.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw on Sunday after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe had to show together that it would not accept the violation of territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Krizi, created by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, is considered to have been determined by the Chancellor by using diplomatic negotiations, even within the “normal group” that is associated with France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Moravecki stated that the Chancellor informed about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukasnko artificially triggered a migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because night after night we record hundreds of attempts about (legal) crossing the border.
He and Chancellor discussed other sanctions for Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we decided to defend the eastern borders of the EU.
Scholz, according to DPA, assured that Varšava was looking forward to German support in dispute with Belarus and condemned the non-human treatment of Lukashenko’s routine with runners.
An accident caused the drunk Polish diaphragm, tried to hide it.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driving another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still be preferred in the driving and driving from the scene of the accident, she lost her driver's license, she went out with the truth out, said TVN24.
She admitted she ran into another nun who asked her for help.
The police came for Sister Celestin.
They gave her a breath test and after they found out that she had been in her blood for over two hours, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she'd testify in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Shaymovich didn't watch his movie.
Czech creators of family comedy saw in American stories about dog lovers.
But they forgot the essential thing about it: the legality of the film craft.
After a duck movie F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, now about the wild emotion in the cinemas is missing another shot Here we watch.
Co-author scenario and director in one person Juraj Shajmovič ml. freely follow his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene, the talking phenomenon Hugo returns and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Szumavian guesthouse who is dying, and so they start to call him a dog, Julia's father and partner, and mainly her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences the first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Shajmovičová (which is also the producer of film) dealt with the procedures of telling in the previous film, but they had at least children and dogs.
This time, she wrote a creative pair a weaker scenario that causes a mix of wonders and feelings of embarrassingness.
Let's get this over with.
Julie, a scientist, is subject to the desire for a child to be dark, and if the correct “constellation” is to be pooled with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are to be determined, on the hood of the car or church tower (self during the ongoing excruciation with the local guide), the earned Colonel Mojmír will shoot his own daughter in the forest (Julia), who will fall into a coma, where the family is taken away from the hospital, so that in the heart of the Shuuvian loneliness can lose the miraculous healing process of the dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the spectator wonders what an unfamiliar gel full of unfaithful situations as well as a figure needed for this message.
Two thieves from the staff, competitions of pedestrians, sumavian charlatan, cops arriving to find “deeps,” and discussing the herbs about the fertiliser strength of the bone flour, and which are prepared by the family in the pension, of course, will be drunk.
When a hero wakes up after a heavy coma and sits on a nanodulated and cuddled with a cigar at a family table and demands that his father's whiskey and falcons become cured by a vegetarian, you can't laugh.
At the top of the viewer’s viewer, he explains that “this sometimes happens after a coma. ”
Sajmovič's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of work with text, ability to build a nose situation, a sense of character and point character, and real leadership.
The acting performances are unbalanced, cut helpless, and the overall impression is marked.
Whenever Luke Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to stop their party, they have too much to play.
The only reason for the film remains the poetic footage of the shamvian nature of the cameraman Vladimír Holomk and the pair of lakes.
It is not enough to cover several characters, a chatal bag and dog hooks, let alone the more human vulgary expressions that the characters let go of.
The argument is not even a flight membership in a tree breeder's club - as in the case of a producer.
With good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of man, dog must also be knowledge of the craftsman if he wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't work out in this case.
There's a little too much erotic for a good family image and a minimum feeling for genres.
Even as a cannistherapy commercial, he wouldn't go through this amateur-like piece of work.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant supply exactly from morons like you.
There's a difference between offering and forced, here's how you don't understand this shit, but that's just because you never tried.
The decision is always to a customer if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you'd been listening to a movie like that, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other one, in it's a great deal of money.
The Middle East is suffering not usually dry moons.
Winter is the only time in the year it rains.
“Almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as recorded at certain stations, it is unusual,” confirms Israel’s meteorological service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term precipitation average in November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore rather a exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, the people of Nazaret Wasi Askar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in winter months, they are shocking and irregular.
There are dependent forests on the winter rains.
Without them they're going to dry and they're susceptible to fires.
It's not just the woods, but also the supply of drinking water and the flag for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galileo Lake, was in spring this year thanks to the three last rainy winters filled on the edge.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water companies warned about the drought a long time ago.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation can be seen here,” the spokesperson of the Israeli Office for Uri Schor water management in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as deceleration or recycling of waste water.
The mountains are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordanska, Ammanu, there are tanker cars.
Vodovody and private wells dry up.
“Letos has increased my orders by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years,” declared Imad Sulejman in September.
In Iran's Isphahan, conflicts between farmers and security forces broke out.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The crown of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in the past few years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
The Israeli Minister of Defense declared that the Vienna negotiations did not “no progress” and that he informed Washington about the preparation of the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz stated on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is staying in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida Gantz, he said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not “no progress, ” and the world power“ understands that the Iranians are playing with them. ”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I did a little cooking, and I grilled in an interview to find out what he actually wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of pyramids was justified.
Because I really don't like these contusions, I've been running out of doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked and left.
You can tell me that I'm a loser, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
The skiers went to the mountains this weekend, waiting for them to eat enough snow and nice weather
This weekend, the mountain resort in the Czech Republic has experienced the first greater proportion of skiers.
After a great snowing at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some skials have therefore started operations.
The convention did not dissuade the obligation to prove itself to the lifts by means of a copy certificate.
While skiers do not complain about their interests, some ski equipment rentalrs report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to crossroads on the weekend.
Skiers wished the weather which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out of the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill,” Ještěd Jakub Hanuš praised his interest.
Hundreds of people went out during the first weekend skiing in the new season also to the Jesenians.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or Šumpersk Brandy Centre were opened.
The weekend visit was very nice, on Saturday and today it came with an estimated 400 people.
The terms are so cool.
Today the sun was lit, it was around minus three degrees, so perfection, did not spare the praised representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators can only sell ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time following the completion of the disease covid-19.
Except for exceptions, people are ready to prove themselves needed documents, said ČTK René Hronie from the Špindler Mill ski centre.
“We only recorded units of incidents,” he added.
Less interested than before the pandemic, some rental houses and ski equipment shops are reported.
The interest in renting skis is, of course, it is.
It's not like in the past years, but there's still customers enough, said Alexander Bokisová from the Opavian shop Skiopava.
The biggest proportion is expected in the season of ski courses.
Also, the king’s wingman Snowbird David Šinták feels that it is not about renting ski equipment such an interest as before.
That time before the pandemic, we were almost loaned.
We were about 50 percent compared to the period before the pandemic, said ČTK Šinták.
He thinks the pandemics have become lazy and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a rental company in Novako on God’s Dara.
By lending skis they started there a week ago, and now the applicants have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to rent this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we expect great interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Novková.
The interest comparable to the outbreak period is also about the ski school.
If we want successful and rich people not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a good life as abroad.
This certainly does not include social health care where it is not often possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There are smart and smart people who don't have any property left abroad.
The company owner abroad won't just leave.
With the rest of it but completely agreed.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people do not have a vision of reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
The migration from Hungary began that one beautiful day won Orban, the year ruled and suddenly the annual emigration increased by tens of thousands.
It's naive to think that the Czech Republic can't get in a position like this from day to day.
The next question is election.
If he lives here bad, he can also win some traditional V4c madman.
Young and educated will leave, remain his supporters, and people whose property cannot be placed on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer's blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic he was in the full stream of autumn, in Thailand he enjoyed tropical weather in the Czech Republic.
While the actor published a blooded photo of his face on social networks.
Is it real injury, or is it a filming lesson?
London police are still looking for the missing Czechs.
Last time she was seen on her way home.
“The disappearance of Petra does not resemble her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her,” said Lucy O'Connor, from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked.
“His family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her, and she simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czechs, according to her on Sunday 28th November around 19:45, left work and headed home to Camberwell.
The last one was allegedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by someone from her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as “a member of the health nurse in Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which belongs under Guy's and St Thomas’ hospital association.”
“We are very concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing,” said a group of health facilities in the twitter contribution.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help her find to contact the police,” the communication continued.
Member of Harriet Harman, who, on Saturday, pointed to the Srnc case at the press conference.
“She has been missing for a few days, she is only 32 years old, from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, worried about death,” said the Labouristic police, holding photos of women distributed to London’s police.
“I feel that we all have a particularly important responsibility to try to find it because she was out of her country, away from her family and worked here for our health care,” said Harman.
Police have already held one man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is unable to place Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don't appreciate Ukraine that either.
They are not “grosses” - but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating itself that Invasa's threat is great and is beginning to have our coming up full of teeth.
I quote upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has GDP in Italy.
Comparing the situation in 38 is beyond that many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punish War and the \"anxy\" sillies :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not appropriate to comply with the agreement from Minsk, Russia was inquiring the ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's how this concentration would respond at the border.
Oh, pacta sunservand...
In Prague since Sunday, new timetables will apply, especially suburban connections.
Travelers in Prague integrated transport (PDI) have been waiting since Sunday for several changes relating especially to suburban connections.
New lines came up, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The integrated system is newly associated with Mladoboleslavsk.
In the capital from Sunday, they have stopped walking from České Budejovice in Zahradní město station.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains, which are on the route from Beroun to the Czech Brod, pass through Prague’s main station.
In the recently established station Prague-Zradní Město will newly stop R17 from České Budějovice and Benesova.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses go up to Light above the Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Old Silesia and Turnov.
Buses will be included in the Mladoboleslav region, including a line with an excess of Liberec and the Royal Region.
37 new lines will be cancelled during integration, and the operation will be adjusted to 12 working lines.
From Prague Zličín will be a new bus line 405, which will drive to Žatka.
There was also a new direct connection to Prague - Kralovec near Rakníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be sent in the morning tip and on the weekend the connection from Prague to Rakník, when the express line will be taken out number 404.
Newly included lines 400 and 410 driving to the Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They're leaving Střížkov Metro Station, not from the Holesovice Nadražovice station.
Friday's line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípu to New Boru and selected connections continue to Rumburka or Cvikova.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimina and Jablonny in Podještědí.
On the contrary, a new operation on the ten of the Mediterranean local routes is cancelled or limited, among other things, to Mochov, Dobríš or Rožmál pod Třemšín.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernisation of the railways, long-term restrictions on the tracks Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Cologne continue.
There are changes waiting for passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replaced by some of the cancelled railway lines, or section is extended to line 420 from Dobríš with follow-up from Prague where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevska.
The changes were made to lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk and are adjusted by routes of some buses at the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region.
Healthy snack/sitting in a supermarket office
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30 minutes break and my only way to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, after work I don't have the strength to practice, I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I'll buy a maximum of pizza chips and a sausage yogurt and apple.
Question: what is healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend I buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about trees that you have to see.
Only a tip of a tree can hide under snow.
If it goes down, the tree can be more susceptible to fungus disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason they don't let us drive outside the convention, but it's one of them.
The confession of Dary's relationship with Nefid: I wasn't even looking forward to this.
The Czech showhouse pond since Friday doesn't live anything other than the discovery of the Dary Rolls and Pavel Nedvěda relationship.
It's been together for years, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Now, Dara sent a comprehensive message to fans, explaining why she kept her love from them for half a year.
“I allow you to say that there is currently no one in Bohemia or Slovakia who would escape that Dara has hunted a bear, or pardon, Newida, who is now playing Dara Rolls, who is in love with the most successful Czech football players in the ears.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and even though they are used to public interest, they have no joy.
Here we go.
What we didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, a singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care about it don't even come out of their canteens, or we whose lives are desperately distracting.
As if one of you wanted to hear the opinion of whether you and your husband or girlfriend are fit enough, or you insisted that everyone really knows the list of your former partners and are familiar with the calculation of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's all you want, dear Dara.
The couple gathered together in Italy, where Rolls traveled because of the preparations of her new fashion collection.
Untrust there has long been acting as Vice President of the Juventus Football Club.
They went out with the truth until now, because they were waiting for the Nevvie's divorce to be completed.
Ivana and her wife have been separated for three years, but they haven't been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us, thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and as much as he does with me, I'm standing by him, and in good and bad, I'm done with Rolls.
Hey, the other commentators already said everything important, but I'm just saying that the colleges are cool to the beginning, my classmates usually met during the first semester or two, and we're friends, and then we're gonna get together, which comes to me as the best option, because you know who you're living with.
The apartments don't usually go too far ahead, so I don't think you're gonna find much, but I'm sure they won't hurt the offer.
Otherwise, not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (as Vranovská, French, etc., that is a very bad address), even some parts of the Jews are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is a lot of student, King's field and that direction is nice, besides it's close to most of the VUT Faculty (I don't know where you're going exactly).
Well, I've never been a renter, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can, if you don't have any more information:)
But that's an example of a totally normal - minded one.
Because of the decision to do several doctors anywhere in Poland, the state does not fund certain schools sufficiently.
Whether they learn what they want and pay off their own or whether they go according to the state and pay for it.
After all, we can't let a private employee control a piece of education just because a few crowns can be added to a full state contribution, and that's why he can teach himself what he wants in schools.
Such an argument is somewhat lost in weight when it is written by a person who expressed himself two days earlier on the petition action for a fight against the Atlantic state:
So the vote against if anyone goes to abortion is the same as a voice to you to make any statues in the square?
I would have consulted you directly with that guy who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced that (and even long-term professionals) it either fits from the eye, or they write something on the way xxx *** or... (in the context) and note that it's inconvenient.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd sort of deal with it in a note based on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and sleepy student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I would suggest that the author or printer simply create his own character that fits what is physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it by chance more like the Odry Empire than OdryNska?
PSS: Someone's already broken it up for you.
Look at this comment with Δοοh
Both politicians and politicians have no idea what will be - our Presidency.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they'd approve of something because no one understood any text is smiling.
All important authorised documents examine the word from words, and yet some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's a matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English are more suitable for non-formal relations, overstandard relations.
In addition, with this English it is quite interesting after the GB performance from the EU.
I don't understand the deal on Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year, and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 nights and never a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only say someone who almost didn't go in there in his life.
Yeah, there's probably most of Brno's Roma population, but all they do is cross over the sidewalk and park where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'm afraid to climb out there in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the center, I'd be able to do it.
The whole apartment is now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dades and lovers of Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's he gonna spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit their first candle, Felix Slováček not.
I don't have an adventurer, so there wasn't anything to light.
I've seen the duke, and Lucie must have, too, said Lightning saxophoneist, who confirmed Patras' words that he frequently visited her.
He's visiting, but he doesn't live in their house in Vinohrady, where the Dado remained alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be for Christmas night.
We recently met with Anika, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen for Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on a regular basis, and I'm sure I'm gonna buy Lucii something, like perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix himself to a music video clip at Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says the Slovak who was glad to meet Luďka Sobota Adriana's wife or the singer Kamilu Nývlét.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to be soldiers and weapons?
I doubt someone's going to defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a total idiot so that he wouldn't have to take this territory.
And I don't understand, why would that be a bad argument, let me explain?
I don't know any other file that could be set up in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are little and they can't afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else the high percentage of healthy people in such a level is not.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending Ostrava is only going to the head of the previous governments, not the army, that asking for new toys for quite a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst dry season in recent years.
According to scientists, there have been fewer precipitation areas in mountain and sub-urban areas, including places where there has not been an emergency for failure.
The reason for the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact also strengthens the way we manage to manage the land.
What about the drought?
And how can we help nature in hard times?
Yeah, well, I'm barely staying in ice skates, I know what to play hockey and the tactics (I've tried in French Hockey Manager) is also a total noise.
And whether you're a hockey team - Russia's wisdom - or China's - so lose by two goals even if you don't have to win at any cost of the game is different than when it's compared.
But like what I listen to Czech commentators who sense what the referees do not notice, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably with all sports, UEFA, and/or Italian actors - or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
The controversers are everywhere.
And if it were the opposite, it's like it's always another time, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than it won, it'd probably be a classic \"wini\" - we've won -
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
Hospitalized is 5766 people.
In total, 34, 451 people died in the Czech Republic, 74 others.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 at 100,000, 871 for 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia has exceeded 10 million on Sundays.
In the last 24 hours 29 929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest day of October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132. It is the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing the “unexplainable“ great wave of disease caused by Omicron,” said Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical consultant for the British Health Office on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with the Omición are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expect their number to grow.
So far, no one died of omikron, but the hospitalization occurs about 14 days after the disease and about three weeks after the disease.
The head of British Labourists Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by having a lockdown last December and were banned Christmas parties, organised at Downing Street Christmas Eve.
A minister of Johnson’s government argued that the bush took place “virtually” over the computer.
However, he was involved in Downing Street, a group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressures pressure to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London, and Christmas parties were banned, they organised Johnson's ministers in spite of a lock-down of numerous soaps.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Today, Boris Johnson won a rough majority in general elections two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove it from the Prime Minister's office.
Interesting how quickly events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits its election in spring, which can end with the 12 - year reign of Viktor Orban.
This will be an election of European importance.
How much can it be expected to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They'll probably not be single because they weren't even the last two choices under Orban.
His side of Fidesz controls the media, changes the borders of the constituency to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fedesh to bring the voters from the decision-making districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as 2014 and 2018?
But the situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain a united opposition.
It's for Viktor Orban and his side a big habit.
Aren't they going to be trying to keep the power to play harder?
Yes, we have some signs that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, she fled to an independent media record of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where the chiefs of secret services argue that opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
Everything starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, last time in 14, my mom's parents haven't had much patience, I don't, my dad's had a long time, but then she's going through an extreme (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very damn, and I was angry like a little awful, to the point that I was lying on the ground in the bushes, and it was all blue, I was about 2x in the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they were crying up, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with violence right now, like a little I've washed up, now I'm at least in the middle of something, and as younger, I'm like my parents have to pay over my hand, so that I never get too much over my hand, so I'm never going to be extreme, but I've always got the urge.
I'm not able to determine how much it's my explosiveity, but I'm sure the education has its share.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think it's just wrong to beat the kids, and that my parents shouldn't do it, especially not at the moment when it wasn't “exploitational,” but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks something up, it's probably not possible for his kids to at least take a little rain on it, so I don't count it.
I don't know why OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
I would therefore call it those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I was wondering if you'd be afraid of getting out of the way?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you get a mortgage for what?

Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciaka?
In Slovakia, the main exam in the process begins with a reader accused of murder by Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnírová.
The death of an investment reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She moved the civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and its connection to the tip of Slovak politics and justice.
How much break will the process for Slovakia mean?
The journalists are responsible for this huge thing.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage sites nowhere
Mr. Karl Havlíčka's proposal needs to be substantially reworked.
The Prime Minister Andrei Babiš is at the end of and the law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and release of deep-sea storage of high radioactive waste is still not there.
The Government’s legislative board has interrupted the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the Government after the summer years.
However, its content is in serious violation not only with the municipalities involved in the Platform against the deep storage but also with the Association of cities and municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-laws from the law expect to strengthen their possibilities in deciding on the repository that concerns have been promised since 2011 when the first work on this legislation has begun and which calls for the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its Coalition Treaty, will re-establish its proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The proposed law by Minister Karl Havlíčka, who has the Platform, is in particular concerned with: The alleged degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of sites for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in this location.
This can be ensured by imposing the duty of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific management.
The proposed proposal of a matter-making intention almost completely leaves public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically merestatists in permit procedures.
The design lacks system settings of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of searching and selecting locations for storage, authorisation and operation.
Members of the municipalities have not much to defend the interests of their citizens in finding storage sites according to today's legal standards.
However, the Authority or the Minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be issued may only submit their comments or appeals.
The action in question does not have an immediate effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
The co-decision of the self-declaration that the Platform requests is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those already advanced in the authorisation of the repository, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration to prepare legislation takes on external legal offices.
In this case, it is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by the SUPRAO and bound to contract with lawyer Jane Zemanek.
The total amount for this work is to make nearly CZK 4 million according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknič, the place of mayor of the village Cejle of Hradek and the spokesperson Platforms against the deep storage site said: After the ministers of industry, who have set up a position of self-repair against state authorities when searching for deep storage of high radioactive waste, we are waiting for a more significant turnover from the new government.
We offer a hand to do so.
We also thank the Association of cities and municipalities, who see such essential structures as directly concerned municipalities in selected locations.
The platform against deep storage comprises 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to implement changes in the access of the state to manage spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that will not be limited only to deep storage facilities.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for any storage is conditional on the prior approval of the municipalities concerned.
The actor John Goodman (69) forced fear - to lose weight: He turned 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything in his lifestyle for years, he was eventually scared by doctors.
They told him if he didn't die, he'd die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half its original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
His new character boasted in Los Angeles during the animated series The Fresh Brothers.
Roseanne's a completely different person from the fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom!
John liked to joke that his friends and family were asking him to lose weight because his big body caused a cracking furniture.
“I put everything in my mouth,” said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slow.
Move, practice.
I get to the age when I can no longer afford to sit on the spot, said for ABC Goodman whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and what you want to use the word “boss”.
If it's a text on a platform that expects players from the game environment, I wouldn't even translate it.
If it was a formal text or a college text, I'd probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the bosse.
There are more types of bosses to everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls, etc. has a number of bosses that yes, and so is the “boss”, something like the master / ruler of the given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (supper boss, Hidden boss) who do not need to beat the game or level to be completed, but often they are even stronger than standard bosses.
Then you need the games of the Half-Life type, where are the bosses, but the player with them directly neutral (Tentacle, Gargantua) and can you even call them something?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
There is simply a simple way to translate the boss probably doesn't even go, Czech, and neither does it solve other languages (the interesting one is simply Catalan, which bosse translates as a final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game of general importance, computer controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous and watching completion of some level or task.

After the missing Peter Srnc's search for British police since December 3rd.
Czech police have joined the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradzowska has been looking for her since December 7th.

The man Peter Srnc saw her colleagues last November 28th.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.

The pre-accession Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in the attack campaign, last month with the coming attacks significantly increased.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategies remain the same for now.
The approved Annex in the e-mail is intended to raise attention to the name that refers to payments and financial transactions in the user.
While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the correction receipt for 11,2021...exe,\" said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan web browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The code is actively searching for stored login data, which is subsequently sent to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic on August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November he remained active and spyware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November, they captured the global delivery campaigns.
Compared to October's data Formbook, he slightly weakened in November, but he still stands for a small five-year-old detection.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on days 3, 10 and 15 November.
The form contains the most common annex with the .exe file extension, which was the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the account name appears further.
The Annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for Czech users.
A significant decline and reduction in activities are reported by security analysts in the Fareit program, which has been worth 1.6 percent of attacks and has had no greater attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.
The smart demos today that don't need oxygen because the oxygen's for the vacccinated asshole.
Prahou's guide was bigger than the media.
Based on the footage of the waterfront parade, and according to my experience, the demonstrator is not afraid of an estimated estimated around 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and opposite coastal communication.
That means a lot of people.
About four thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the parade.
I say something new is born here, writes Radek wet.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or branches of the population led to finding a common language.
Only the separate anti-vaxers, the anti-routines and the spol would not be able to fill or pay such a great guide.
The shares of the Chípl dog association have a high popularity, reminds me of the Milan moments for the democracy of the screws.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same podium and technique.
It's hard to say what a movement would make of this dissatisfaction depends not only on the transfer of money, but also on whether a triple vaccine from Pfizer will not become a square and more dose.
It's definitely not going to be left-handed or medium-sized movement, you bet.
The triple vaccine will almost certainly become multidose, because it's obvious that we're going to have to be overlooked every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists who are proud to be human.
End of the heel, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister reporting a change
Bulgaria's President Rumen Radev entrusted with the establishment of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the counter-corruption movement we continue in the change that won November's election.

However, the winners of the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so they followed a two-time election.

Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago when she came from work home on the south British metropolis.
