Peter Čech: Move to the last minute?
Maybe it's everything.
Today is the last day you can jump through the transfer window and make a big pass.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Peter Čech, currently an alternate goalkeeper, Chelsea, but now they don't sit on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Michov NH Hotel, speaks with Czech journalists and is about to meet the Czech general with Americans and then also to the sharp start of qualifier about Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's new season, Premier League prefers Thibaut Courtois, Czech Republic for the first time in ten years in London's club.
It was a long time ago that he might be interested in Real Madrid.
In the introduction of the season, he lost Spanish Superbahara in battles with Atlétik and did not manage to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
The interest of Paris SG has also been calculated.
The one to the season of the French league ended with two wins and two remes, shot St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively pushes the AS Monaco boot club most.
He has 1-1-2 in the league so far, and on the weekend he broke up with Lille with a mere 1:1.
The news that Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers today came up on an English site.
According to English bookmakers, Czechs' departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet wrote course 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll still change your dressing within the last few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Maybe there'll be an offer that won't be refused during the day.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(Laughter) - Well, I don't know yet how much of an offer she can't be rejected, actually, looks like.
It would have to come to the agreement of all parties above all would have mattered to Chelsea's attitudes, whether any offer of the club would be solved or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer when you are in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract in a new location?
I didn't think about it that way.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, and they're all somewhere in the representational reunions, and I'm sure there's a lot of pressure to close today.
So somehow realistic would be.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you don't push out?
The situation that I haven't missed in the first three games of the new season is new to me after 15 years of careers.
However, there is no reason to panic, to pack and go somewhere.
I want to take this fight for Chelsea goalkeeper's position to continue to participate, and he's at the coach who chooses what decisions he'll make in the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, it is important for me to have a sports perspective, but I also look at it from the personal page to which the needs of the family obviously belong.
Is it possible that you could catch another club in England as well?
That's the question I thought I'd never talk to about.
But everything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.

Restoration of a very American ideal that human rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law to protect trade unions as civil law.
\"As the unions work, there are jobs for the middle class,\" says Ellison, the democratic senator for Minnesota, who is the co-chairing Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to present the law strengthening the position of employees together with John Lewis' occasional rights.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal possibilities as to prevent discrimination in trade unions, such as other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-discrimination forces
Adjust the employment relations law so as to enable all employees who face discrimination if they want to engage in unions, judge in a civil court - and condemn compensation or compensation - is correct and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other designers in the law are presenting is to reintroduce the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect employment rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country breathed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to collect.
When the United States has occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to accept the Constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja military vehicle will be replaced by democracy.
They believed that employees and their unions played a role in the formation of new Japan, included their language and have openly acknowledged that “the rights of staff to gather, negotiate collectively and act on them are guaranteed“
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a Constitution to ensure that the Fascism of Adolf Hitler will be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote in the new nation, and thus included a clause openly saying: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed by each individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements that will restrict this right or seek its damage will be repealed. Measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, proposed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the appellants and Roosevelt guaranteeed that “everyone has the right to create unions and enter them in the context of the protection of their interests,”
Americans have received the basic bonus that human rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create trade unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in an equivalent partner position - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organise and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr said fifty years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Today everyone knows that the union forces have not reduced the nation's strength, but have spread it.
They increased the standards of millions of people's lives, created a market for industry and production, brought them up to an uncircumcised level.
Those who find the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't have either.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in trade - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restore the ideals that have raised America and made it a true promise to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law, which could've shut down all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
The Federal Judge temporarily blocked the Louisian law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The Regulation, signed by Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is to enter into force on 1 September, would require the physicians performing abortion to have the right to accept a patient at the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The resolution of the judge means that doctors may temporarily continue to implement legal abortions and, in the meantime, they must provide for this authorisation.
“The proposing party will be able to carry out its activities legally and, in the meantime, obtains a permit,” stands in the resolution of the Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
The activists for the right to overcome the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would provide doctors with more time to obtain a permit.
“Today’s decision ensures women in Louisiana to be safe from the general law to prepare them for health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Centre for reproductive rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, claimed the prosecution to block the law.
It was not clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics that were not between the complainants and also requesting that authorisation.
Louisiana is among the 11 countries which have approved similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi declared such measures as counter-deposit.
A key part of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to suffer together with the Association of American Parents and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this permission lays down requirements which are not necessary in medical terms.
The opposition to abortions argued that measures were intended to protect women's health and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed due to measures.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights has indicated that only one abortion physician has a permit in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop making abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for his safety, she said the group.
The Louisiana authorities replied that they would not punish physicians who performed abortions while waiting for an application for rights to be made.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, killing in rural ovarian cancer more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video with their deceased mother's homage who died of ovaries' cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than at their benefit in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records of over 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of five years after diagnosis lived.
Susan Jordan's Head of Research from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute indicated that women in rural and remote areas had about 20 percent higher probability than women in urban areas during the study.
MALÁ STUDIE: New medicines can slow down lung cancer and ovaries
Women's researchers were watching during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival influenced the age of women during diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in elderly women who had cancer diagnosed with advanced stages.
In women in rural and remote areas, about 20 percent were likely to die more likely than in women in urban areas during the study.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
“The disease can best cure gynecooncologists who usually sit in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving medical services on distances to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes and programs to support people who are treated far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is regardless of the geographical location of the low, which highlights the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer dancer today will publish the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the young mother Elisha Neave from the city of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive form of ovary cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of owners home
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of owners home less than 35 years could lead to reaching “the main age group of gardeners - garden centres will lose up to 10 million pounds per year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes spend 55 % of the amount they spend in their own garden.
As other factors that threaten the industry, which generates an estimated £5 billion per year, shows the increase in the number of people living in very urban areas where there are no gardens, the promise of placing a place of garden used as a parking area and a shrinking size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of house owned has fallen from 61% to 43 %, the lowest expenditure on garden products in the UK is one household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society have stated that living in a subcontract or lack of space does not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden counselor for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular plant cultivation in the flower pot - when they move, they can take the plants with them -
HTA’s report revealed that “the golden age of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from 80 to mid-1990.
It also foretold a higher rest this year thanks to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin at the meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me of Hitlerjugend most, saved the atom weapons and basically told everyone that their views were stolen, he gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I have this feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that's how they can control them both by nationalism, and by the fact that a complex of less valuables can transform into imperialist cocks.
Time flows east apparently different than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long ago gone, the West thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time, and it is necessary to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930 ’ s, just before the power of the Nazis was captured and then an explosion of nationalism was followed by an unlike situation in Russia today.
And then this totally identical cult of strong leaders, the youth of journalists, the destruction of incomparable political opponents, discrimination between minorities and homosexuals, that is, indeed, quite similar.
Vladimír Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians are missing after the time Russia ruled half the world and the second part was shaking before them.
I guess the Western politicians caused it themselves, maybe little Vladimír was paying his shoulder, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made a order at home, looked like he didn't even want to go anywhere and bug his knives at home.
Now he's decided he's going back to his lost position.
He's gonna start slow, he's got time.
The leader is probably alive, so where would he hurry?
He sent Kavdan, and now he's going to go to Ukraine, then there's a line of Dwarfs from the Baltic.
The Russian bear has been slinglinging in the basket for a long time.
It will certainly already notice China, who will somehow jump out too much and certainly make a point on the Far East.
And the Germans of Vladimir are also very angry about how well they are, and I put that on their ass at 45.
How about making one new Novorosy in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base and ours there's a lot of them, and how they print them there, too, they've already wanted to destroy one of them.
For our veterans will now remember how they were supposed to be in Czechoslovakia.
In fact, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he is so soft, he can break like onions and eat the whole EU.
That would be how it would play to jump to great Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And we're gonna use our soukmen who live in their territory as explosives.
The Russians are all over the place, and when they say they print them there, they just print them there, and we're not gonna let them go, we're gonna protect them.
And Russia will rule again, for what else is born.
Europe is only good as a premier on which proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey has called for an American diplomat because of the spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the highest-storey American diplomat in the country to explain the American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that American charge d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to documents provided by the former American analyst the National Security Agency was Turkey's priority objective of US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan has warned about the importance of the report and said that all important states are watching each other.
According to which the German intelligence service focused on Ankaru, the older news has developed a more bitter response with the Turkish government.
Serial Game of the throne introduced other tricks of the fourth row
Makers Games of the throne currently film episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about the 4th series of tricks.
The most visible are the computer modifications to the serial environment and the mass scene when the giant army of the famous Daenerys becomes the giant army.
Police chief in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of blackmail by police officers and state officials of the City Hall in Calvia's administrative area.
Police manager in Calvia on the Holiday Island of Mallorca was arrested following the accusations of raised entrepreneurs and bar owners in an unfamiliar party quarter in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was in custody after he was accused of corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballen, the street where most bars and night businesses are located in Magaluf.
According to Mallorca Diario's Internet Log, on Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of blackmail from police officers and state officials to the City Hall in Calvia's administrative area.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for connection to corruption charges, and together with Navarre, they're being heard by the judge.
The Spanish National Journal of the ABC quoted unsatisfied owners of night businesses, according to which the advantages of public actors have serious consequences on their business.
“It’s not long ago about making money, it’s about survival,” said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don't mess with our living.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got on the main site of magazines all over the world after a video appeared on YouTube of 18-year British tourists who provided oral sex to 24 men during the tour of the bars.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to watch drunks and skiers in the series of holiday parties in Magafulu by reducing the number of unfamiliar alcoholic tourers around bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where there was an oral sex event, was forced to close for a year and together with tour organizers following Carnage bars to pay fines of €55,000 (€37,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, was also a witness of many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the fashionable waves known as “balconing” where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
First spring day recorded by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide airport
JARO brought South South South Australia an ice surprise, came with a strong rain and a sharp wind that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm of precipitation is due to arrive in the city until nine hours of the evening and another 6,6 mm will be on Sundays during the night.
The last rain was presented together with several short surges associated with the storm and wind blowing, which began eight o'clock in the evening, and in about ten minutes they brought nearly 4 mm precipitation.
After several early doses of spring came in the winter last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday in the city at just 15.8 °C.
It is believed that storm weather has contributed to the delayed arrival of Virginia Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land after 7:30, but hit him at short distance with a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone landing.
The windlands at Adelaide airport at that time reached approximately 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop off from the second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft was subsequently caused by the delay of further flights including the Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to predictions, temperatures will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday, and one or two surges may appear.
After the war in Gaza, Israel’s children return to school
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near Gaza were returned to school on Monday after they spent the summer in anti-bombic shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes with rockets and minerals.
The beginning of the school brought a feeling of joy and excitement to the community in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In Assdodu, a city in the south of the country, a school worker hit by a rocket, removed from the walls of the remains of the roofs and expected the return of the children.
“We have a bit of fear, but we are looking forward to it,” Ronit Bartová said, the resident of the Saudi kibuc and English teacher at the local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to get back to everyday routines.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said that “it’s a little strange, suddenly going back to school.
“ We had a few tough moments and we did not leave the house at all,” she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire of the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or their homes left and entered a safer area away from Gaza to escape rockets and minemets.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village close to the Gaza border, in which a shooting from the Palestinian minomet killed a four-year-old boy with a return weight.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
Chairman of the Government of Benjamin Netanyjah visited the school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was strongly hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study closely, adding: “We will provide you with education and security.
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
Although the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fight, however, it did not solve key problems as a requirement for Hamas to end the Gaza Israeli-Egyptian blocks and to reopen Gaza airports and ports.
Israel calls for Hamas to be armed and the return of the bodies of two soldiers fallen in war.
The new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of the deaths were radical, although for these claims there is no clear evidence.
66 soldiers and six civilians including Thai workers died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza have fired during the battles of Israeli cities in particular on the south of the country 4 591 missiles and weapons of minerals.
The Israeli army has taken more than 5,000 air raids and more attacks.
Israel’s attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza and estimated 250 000 people hiding in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into a commission shelter.
Tens of thousands of people still staying in hiding, and because of the ongoing fights they put off school officials the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope that schools will soon open up so that we can complete education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13 - year - old boy from school in Gaza’s largest city.
I'm standing behind you.
And Lafatu suffers from temperature
The Czech football team met before Wednesday’s preparation match with the US and the subsequent initial qualifier of Europe’s European Championship against the Netherlands before noon.
Of the thirty-year-old band, the Spartan attacker David Lafat is having trouble with the temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta's had some problems last week, it's about more players, and David probably still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible,” said Coach Pavel Vrba.
“If it is two or three days, or it will fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his condition that our doctor will decide,” he added.
Other players are fine.
“Of course, someone has some pain, but it is not like they could not train or participate in a match in the middle of the United States,” declared the Czech coach.
On Sunday night, Vrba called as the last player in the Spartan War.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision to decide, others were also Mediterranean.
I decided on the basis of Luke’s perspectiveary player, who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I am behind it,” Vrba pointed to Vach.
What about Sharal?
Let's see what happens to Latina
It is not excluded that nominee might change in the case of health problems.
On the weekend with great performance, Josef Šural, was glamorous, for example, in Liberec, who gave the Hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown the form.
Let's see what David Lafata's up to.
If he can't be available on Wednesday, I'm not saying that I can't bring in any of the players who were interested in the Czech League, he pointed out Vrba.
This afternoon there will be a representation of training in Strahov, on Tuesday, a classical pre-game training before the US duel to Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
Fighting Americans is playing Wednesday from 20:15, and the National Team will strive for the premiere victory under Vrbou.
In the previous three preparatory matches he played two remes and lost once.
The qualifier struggle with the Netherlands is then on the 9th September from 20:45 p.m.
Dogs going to Italy in the Netherlands
Vrba is glad to have more time for training unlike previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we don't have so much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on what we best prepare for the Netherlands,” praise Vrba.
The Netherlands will present on Thursday in Italy before playing in Prague, and duel will personally follow the former temporary representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that they're from the game.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have a game and we'll have a little talk about it.
A new coach comes to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there,” Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, flat prices increased most over the last seven years in the winter period.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased by 1.1% in August, said the Agency.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August to 4,2 %, highest increase in winter months from 2007.
The annual price increase reached 10.9%, more than twice per year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data Tim Lawles said they run Sydney and Melbourne on the market.
RP Data figures show that the flats prices in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while the prices in Melbourne increased by 11,7 %.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an increase in prices on average between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by the State by the cost reduction, and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when spring began, the number of real estates for sale will increase in the following months, which will be “a real test” for the market.
‘With regard to the continuing high level of auctions, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that the housing value will increase even further over the next three months,’ he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me.
He never told me “I love you. ”
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry's testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother died, Henry went through “a thorough, therapy, and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew so little about him.
You never saw his face, but you heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at the crike.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a hit in a kriret.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently Henry visited Dudley's foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked into what life had to be like for him.
Today there's a little bit more light in there, but it's still dark, it's buried, a gloomy labyrinth, where flames explode, and there's a lot of smoke and planting.
My dad always got in the tub and just lying there, then it was like he was slowly singing for himself, because he's washing the laundromat from himself.
When I walked around, I realized that he'd been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't take anyone, said he, “I love you. ”
When Mom was sick and dying, we began to call each other “I love you, I love you, I love you. ”
His daughter Billie, who's with Dawn French, let him experience the love that he missed as a child.
You can stop doing this “I love you. ”
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
The French guy who was married to 25 are still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why shouldn't we be friends with Dawn?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of weight, and they started showing symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said: “You must make a radical change.
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to hold a drastic diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tired.
Nobody wants to eat carrots themselves.
A change in the direction of picking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After he got credit from criticism for his Othella, he got into the theater.
It followed Komedie with all the mistakes and the Plitos of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcomas and comedy that filled out his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him at the stage parading someone, and he wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His TV career began in the mid 70 ’ s: “I was the only black imitator/comik on television for a long time.
He was studying for the march.
In addition to having to see me public, I had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to invent acting jokes, be a star and perform on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned rights to stage production The Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program in which actors dressed as black people, Henry finally performed his comedy for five years.
My family's been hated because of that.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years appreciated by the main product of British TV, ” but also “the grotesque parody of black people, ”
In the 1980s Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented figures that also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as chef Gareth Blacklock in a comedy series of Chef!.
Another decade of advertising, documents, television shows, and roles in films, but after sending his series LennyHenry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said: “So what you're going to do now, Lene, it seems a little bit like you're stuck in one place or a little bit out of your way?”
Next one was the documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About? What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had an allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone we were interviewing on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judith Dench, said: “You should try it.
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines of Othell's final speech for the document, and he was already on his way.
It gave me a feeling I could do it.
It's like it's giving me courage.
\"That's what it's about. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So testing was hard and I read the game months and months before.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
He soon started playing in Komedia full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought: “You changed your mind.
There was a technical fault, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for meeting the audience.
“The man in my head has said to me: “Let him fix the computer, you must now have ten minutes to entertain them.”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problems were solved.
I left the stage, and there was something in me that said: “Hm, thank God.
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can work it out for me.
“You play, so stay a role.
Henry at the Pilots in the Ghostess Theatre
Learning the text of the Plots was a challenge.
The panic is pretty good, adding determination.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like a sign of God that says: “This is what you should do. ”
Of course, that's what ZUM's voice says.
So I'm staying there.
I really like it.
I'm glad to be in rehearsal.
Henry, however, remains the brain of a comedy - the whole time our interview breaks up with his humorous performances when he comes in and comes out of the role of the imitator.
I've decided not to make stand-up because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
When you're still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I make Live at the Apollo, but it doesn't make me happy anymore.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in this room with a director who helps to draw the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having fun in acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is registered by civil servants to light up on non-profit employees
Kenya began with a biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove from the government's payment list of employees.
According to government statements, employees who do not register will cease to receive payment in the following two weeks.
The government considers that thousands of people receive wages even after the State Service has left.
After the office took place in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatt promised that he would avoid corruption in state administration.
The audit carried out this year has shown that the state is losing at least one million dollars per month ($700 000) on payments made by non-members and in the next abuse of official power.
The government suspects that payments are continued to be deposited on bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the State Administration's employee left, the BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must be included in the identification centers for the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, in the government declaration.
In addition, he says that anyone who does not make any excuses will be removed from the payment list.
“With the provision of genuine public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its establishment and will also be used to clean the payment of the letter at both levels of government, and thus solve the problems of non-members,” said Anne Waiguru, the Secretary of State for Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish policemen arrested for “sacrifice against the government
The local media states that in Turkey, they were arrested because of “the conspiracy against the government - a total of 33 policemen.
The police office hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, there were 14 highly built officials in detention.
Some of them were involved in a December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for the alleged organisation of a criminal gang and phone listening.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time the Prime Minister) referred them as part of the work of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened again after summer holidays on Monday (1 September).
This day is traditionally important to families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and Prime Minister Arseni Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools opened up again, but that it was decided to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools, a traditional ceremony for the 1st September took place.
Not across Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, connected to the Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, visited by Jaceňuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the fact that the kids wear their shirts, bring balloons and teachers to give flowers.
In Fairhead's Row, maybe the BBC found the boss for a tough time.
There is a cloud of fame from the banking world, media management and internal conclave of conservative parties.
He's got the experience of the front lines himself.
The career began in Bain and Co consultants, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearls media world.
She was the executive director of Financial Times for seven years.
They say a million pounds closer to her distance.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, former CEO of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expert: she became a government adviser.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a toilet with poison.
Not only is the BBC extensive and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns two directions: inside on top of the hierarchy of its own leadership of the BBC, but also out in the public's voice in times of rest when things don't work.
This is a almost unsustainable monopoly that demands thorough reform.
But who the director would risk coming to a firm complicated as a Chinese dynasty, dissipating it and making himself ready for work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrinking - her power, her finances - and how her status is revised.
With the expansion of the competition range and the new technology questioning old security, the immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC are of great danger.
For a modest amount of 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of the household and is costing only 40p a day.
Moreover, the Bank’s promise is clearly rising to 53% of the supporters compared to 31 % of the years ago.
Models of use of the BBC services have changed: Today, the news titles appear on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can look at the Player.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
The Texas Governor Perry claims that he did not approve the insulting tweet
Tweet from the official twitter account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained a offensive picture of the democratic state attorney who initiated the criminal charges of Perry from abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published in Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
He left my account a tweet that was not authorized.
“ I disagree with your tweet, and I downloaded it,” he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants haven't answered the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
Previous tweet published an indecent, humorous picture of the state attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to the management of the drunks in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay the funds for her office, which Perry, the possible candidate for President in elections 2016, brought this month before the great jury in Austin.
“ I’m not always driving three times the alcohol level in the blood than the limit allowed... but when I do, I sue Governor Perry for calling me responsible. ”
I'm the coolest boy in Texas.
The Lehmberg Bureau did not lead the investigation against Perry.
Michael McCrum was in charge of him, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was designated as a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and accused of calling him a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge to reject the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the most long-term governor in Texas's history is contrary.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Department of Destruction of Public Interest, which has its registered office in Travis County, and is cutting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal caused a formal complaint to the left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active, and sometimes they'll be famous.
After he ended up in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign at the fifth place of his party committee, Perry replied to speculation that he could end up with his own photo, running near the lake, saying: “This is where I am, South Carolina,
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns “to normal”
One of London’s most prominent developers warned that the housing market in South East England “backed back to a normal level of activity.
Living in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and the widespread concerns of the credit bubbles led the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and vice-president of the company for demanding clients of Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions from the top point of 2013 - he adds that it provides a “stabil environment for the functioning”
During the decline, the London housing market worked well because it was flooded by foreign buyers to the capital.
According to the catastral Office data only last year, prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, which far exceeded the average of 6,7 % in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley increased by about five in the past year and reached £422,000 at the end of April.
However, in recent months, the strengthening libra is not so attractive for foreign buyers of London's real estate - some of them have also been intimidating the introduction of new real estate taxes and the talk of the possible “Security tax” with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections next May.
The London Real Estate Office Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent rules for loans, slows down during the second half of the year also the rate of market growth for real estate sales and prices.
The new Bank of England data showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages per month, indicating that the housing market is calmed down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, decreased on the basis of the fact that home prices have already begun to decrease, with the forecast of rising prices of London real estate for 2015 to 3%.
According to WA Ellis' real estate office, in London's most expensive quarters as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have decreased by a quarter every year.
Yet, the demand for housing was a blessing in the capital for Berkeley because it increased cash for forward sale to over 2,2 billion pounds.
Piddlely added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same, and thus the forward sale remained -
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before tax increased by 40% to £ 380 million, revenue by 18% to €1.6 billion.
On Monday before the annual meeting, Pidgley said that it was expected that the annual revenue of Berkeley would be in line with the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley's event stopped at the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon at 23,96 pounds.
Hacker posted photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th Academy Prize.
The photos of Oscar Jennifer Lawrence's owners have disappeared online because of the hacker who claimed to have “scientific” photos of other hundreds of starting actresses.
The film stars “Hunger Games” confirmed that Lawrence's photos were true and the hacker criticized for “the obvious violation of privacy, ”
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who stole photos of Jennifer Lawrence will publish.
Hacker's pictures, which were originally published on the server for 4chan's image sharing, reportedly received by spaces in the Applu iCloud internet storage system. A detailed list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars, including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsteadová and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world - Winstead’s Twitter also criticized the act.
“I hope those of you who looked at the photos we took years ago in private homes are satisfied with each other,” said Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for cable TV series Nicokodoreon “iCarly” and “Victorious”, denied that the photos were real. She said on Twitter: “These are my supposed naked photos are ZURH, people -
It's better to cut it loose in despair.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the pop star spokesperson Ariany Grande denied that the alleged photographs were real.
An extraordinary example of Howard Jacobson’s approved new novel about love and letter “J”
They've dissolved, it's the best way to describe it, they've gradually broken up like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only some woman said to him from time to time that he was too serious, too complicated, sharp, isolated, and maybe a little pruded.
And then she shaked his hand.
He misplaced it.
He could fuck like a bullock, yes.
The last victim of this capacity was a starting love skin, which more than usual promised to relieve him of his lonely life boredom and maybe give him some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild sin of hair and an overflowing heart from the village on the northern island, which was even lighter and more unholy than Port Reuben.
In the south came the older companion who thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, appropriately, Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes looked down, in the vans were dead spiders, the slimmers signed themselves at the windows as if they thought they were part of the place, the garden was growing and the plevel reminded the huge shafts of the greens.
The house looked like a cottage of children's stories, scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the preliminary list of nominations at Man Booker Prize 2014.
The selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin sat in long grass and held hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, unreserved public station that provided the country with comforting music and comforting reports, when in this regard the eyes of her burnt crossed legs reminded the old song of a long forgotten blacknoske comic that his father liked to listen to.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they didn't play such songs in radios anymore.
They were not prohibited - nothing really was forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get into the desuetuda, just like the word desuetado himself.
Human taste has proved what could never have been made of regulations and positions outside the law, and as well as people with regard to books, they choose memoárs, in which poor people become rich, cooks and love novels, so in music balads are selected.
Kavern had to take off the day and started playing the imaginary piano and rough, the comic voice sang the Serenado of Aillin's big corridors.
Ailin didn't get it.
“This was the favorite song from the jazz pianist Fats Waller,” he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter j before he came out of his mouth.
It started like a game when he was a kid.
My father told him he played the game with his father.
When you were at the word that started at j, they didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you money.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew he was expecting it, that was all.
He must have explained what jazz is.
Ailin's never heard of one.
Neither jazz, even if it wasn't directly built outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvization came out of fashion.
In life there was only a place for one “if they were“
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she'd end up.
Same in humor.
His inadequacies have gone to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed by songs.
Although he hasn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, Kevern knew about his father's half-carry collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she couldn't remember the time when favorite singers weren't black.
No laws or pressure, either.
The free society is one in which each part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were happy by chance - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
The people of African-caribian origin with a temper and the contemporance were bred for boaring and athletes, so they sang and ran.
People originating in the Indian subcontinent, as a natural source for electronics, took responsibility for no family being without a functional phone.
The cops who stayed were installers, the Greeks, who stayed, washed the dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while they did, CO SE STALO, KYBY TO STALO - were afraid that they would blame them for putting them in the fire, they were afraid that the next fire would eat them - they opened up a restaurant where they sold mud and smoked water smokes, not to draw attention to themselves and to the ineffectiveness of eating them slowly.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the balads, Ailin hardly understood how the dirty words that Kavern had just sang to her could come up with music.
Music was the expression of love.
“In fact, they are not dirty,” Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with too many legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of safety.
Not a word could have escaped from the soundproofing letters.
Ailin still didn't get it.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was dying to put two fingers in her presence again.
She already thought he was weird.
“He seemed funny, ” he said.
She disbeliefly shaked her head and shaded Kever's view.
There was nothing but a change of her rabble hair in the wide world.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“If you think,” she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
Not at all.
Maybe some ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have told her “I love you, but it was too soon.
\"Your fat ankles are attracting me right now,\" he tried.
I'm kind of persuasive.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to make him repeat the cruelness that she was reading in jokes.
Maybe his father was a cruel intentional.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Ailin Solomons broke down and got out of her bedside, threw down the radio and spilled her inconceivable wine.
Wineless, so drinking couldn't be worth it.
She seemed to shake like a palm leaves in the storm in her excitement.
“My cocksucker attracts you being a jerk,” she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her as she did because of her unfaithful words, so because of the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood up against him.
She thought she'd get hit?
She didn't talk to him about her life on a cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt it was the same as here at the base.
They were covered in the same clear and ice ocean.
Same confusion of men, then, CO SE STALO, even even more indifferent and more frozen than their ancestors, smugglers and priests, angryly wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to draw up their hand on any woman who dared to refuse them or to laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
At first, it was the most common expression for the erotic irritability between the man and the woman: the antibody of the poor baad about the love that the radio blazed - first they anointed her, then one murdered her.
According to Kever's view, excessive culture was an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons initially suggested that he leave.
He picked up like an old man.
She was feeling tired, but the weight of his sorrow surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She looked at him leaving - as if she was watching him from the window on the floor - the man that got what he caused himself.
Adam's leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart closed down because of him and all men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her up.
The man turned away from her, her shoulders were hung, shamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she seem to know this look well, even though she couldn't remember the only moment until today that she'd ever seen it?
Ailin Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About twenty years after these events Esme Nusbaumová, intelligent and exciting 20-year-old researchers working in Ofnow, a non-static public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the continuation of light and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where it was reduced or directly stopped, most expected that enough money and energy had been spent on its removal.
“ Many have to do so and many have to do so, ” she wrote, “to calm down the birth aggression of the people who fought in many battles, and most of them had to win, especially in the sad, difficult places of the country, where, despite the tip of the church towers coming out above the living fences of the human kindness, there was a historical discovery of only a rare phenomenon.
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the boxes.
The residents breathe over the sentimental balads, look for unfortunate stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that the old brutality is kept as hard as the city's aglomerates, but evidence also shows that at home, at the workplace, roads and even on sports courses there is new and offensive intolerance.
“You have a tendency to a very small style, ” said her superior.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum has bowed her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
“I have the impression that I do not have to answer that,” said Esme Nusbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme remarried her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I do not ask why,” said Rabinowitz, “that I would have something against ateists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have prejudices on this workplace.
We serve unconnected companies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which is absolutely acceptable and commendable in itself, may sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Clearly, you yourself are presumptuous to the Church - things that you call “cruth - and“ violent - could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural strength and energy.
We're still dealing with what's been going on, what's going to happen if it happened yesterday, is preparing the country with her basic life force.
While Rabinitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
His head was on a light board of roses, giving him recommendations that were sent to the world for the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the balloons, go to the musicians, use your phone, convert, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak better than silence, a singing word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
“ I totally understand your reservations,” answered Esme Nusbaum’s silence when she was sure that her superior was over, “and I do not say that the wound was not healed as we say that she was healed.
My concern, first of all, is that if we are not aware of this before, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what the STALO has led to, if we do not find out about it.
This time, we're not going to vent on the others.
Luther Rabinitz joined the finger terminals.
That should mean infinite patience.
“ You go too far, ” he said, “when the steps that may have taken, and perhaps did not do your grandparents, you describe as mistakes.
You also take too far to talk about the fact that they were venting their “out of time, ” and“ untrustful - on “other ones. ”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting the presence, we are not talking about “us” and “anyone else.
There were no “we,” and there were no “they, ”
All we know is it was chaotic times.
“ During which, if we are honest with each other, ” Esme took courage, “we are none without fault.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, it happened.
That was before.
That's not what I'm going to say - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that could be brought upon someone, there are no things that should be fixed, even if correction were appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past than to learn from it -
The past exists to forget it.
If there's anything I can add to--
Luther Rabinitz's broken the finger terminals.
“I will take your report into account,” he said and released it.
A day when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcycle who ran into a sidewalk in a way that was described as “brute and angry”
The odds are happening.
The Lesoth Kingdom Army claims that no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Military Officers of the Lesoth Kingdom denied that they would organize a coup to bring the government down, claiming that they were acting against police suspects from an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country and says that the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maestro.
After he said that he was threatened by death, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighbouring South Africa.
The spokesperson Major Ntle Ntoi said that it was not really about the coup, but the military's response to the threat of “political fanatics” that the police tried to arm.
“Today, the command of the defense components of the Kingdom of Lesotho took place after several reports of information service that several groups of police are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make their way in the land of the wilderness,” said the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesperson Clayson Moneyel said military actions looked like an attempt to bring the government down.
“ Even though no one has declared that he has been taking power through power, he seems to have the actions of the forestoth defense components of the sign of state coup,” he said.
Military representatives of the Lesoth Kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their casino on Sundays and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for government.
Thabane said that in his opinion he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the parliamentary meeting for internal disputes, there is tension in Lesotho.
He declared that despite the opposite claim, he did not undermine his actions as a government.
Production in the euro area is at 13 months minimum
The production growth slowed down to a minimum of 13 months according to the carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51,8 has fallen to 50,7.
Number higher than 50 means expansion.
New orders and factories have damaged the increasing tension between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The numbers come from the European Central Bank's Thursday meeting (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and with the threat of inflation stagnation to 0.3%.
There was speculation that ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he considered quantitative releases of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US have joined during the financial crisis.
“ Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the producer is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, the main economy of Markit.
The German production PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the 11th month minimum of 51.4.
In the second largest economics of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
The concern is about France, Italy has passed from expansion to stagnation.
The sign that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared is not very calming,” said Dobson.
The industry's slowdown is likely to feed oil into fire to analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57,3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economy in IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to do about the production overview of purchasing managers for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing -
He added: European producers now have a very difficult life because increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds more uncertainty to increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has clearly hit - especially the trust of consumers, which is likely to cause some orders to be deducted or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He stated that, as “more likely, the ECB would finally have to do some form of quantitative release, ” he stated, “we expect it to be limited,” he stated.
Ten years of hell of survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the established school children still suffer.
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals at Beslan School in South Russia were held hostage by thousands of people.
During the suffering that lasted three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of which were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims that escaped death during the resurrection at the school.
Exactly ten years after the fearful establishment of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, warned survivors of heroes before the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they captured and murdered fantastic terrorist children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to tragedy has joined the east and west, which has led to negotiations and the future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years of age, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims that escaped death during the resurrection at school.
We found amazing young people who resisted calamity, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What's their greatest wish?
That war that destroys Ukraine now - and in which children like them are dying - has already ended.
Girl trying to climb back into the destroyed school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as only in her underwear trying to climb back into the bombed school after she exploded the bomb.
The confused Aida desperately sought her mother, Larissu, who is now forty.
They were worried that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were from blood.
I got up and went back to find Mommy.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries she thought she had been fully healed, but yesterday she said: “The pain has returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
My knees have been shrapneled.
Her goal is to become a dentist to help people as doctors helped her.
“This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly did not destroy him,” she said.
“It just happened to me, and that can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to friends about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Gapoev were killed there.
As a kid, we played together and we imagined we were going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget her arrest, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help that we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, I think a lot of people will see her for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from repeating itself.
A boy who escaped the rain of a bullet and believed that his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia, the children of school began in seven years) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of their mother Tamary.
At that time, he said: “Mamka told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him: “Go away.
He was afraid that he was dead, he was running, and he saw a crying bat, and he grabbed the baby's hand and ran the shower bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother is dead. ”
He says: “I couldn’t save her.
In fact, Tamara got involved in freedom and lay in a hospital with a broken leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I was looking for happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (after the missing News of the World), where he was Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
“The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are already pale.
I remember right after that, I threw all my gun at the game.
But today I can play computer games that are shooting at, and I don't have a problem with it.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think of myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard with, and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially as I could choose anything I wanted in the toy shop, and as I was driving a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffers as much as he has suffered and his friends because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I am so sorry for anyone who has to go through such terrible things,” says Damir, who took part in voluntary activity in the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work at the police one day, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence after the attack, and there were no children anywhere who would scream and run, and that kept quiet for months.
He remembers his journey to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste for the pine tree, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from a water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month since the horror.
I was surprised to see how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed to better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there's still a lot of kids killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think there's only something war for a lot of people in the news that they listen to when they get bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are doing, what's so terrible.
I can still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice, quiet boy, he's not even aggressive or angry.
He doesn't want revenge, for example, he doesn't care.
I know she doesn't like to remember it, but she's got a lot closer to six classmates, and she's been going to the gym from time to time, and they're burning candles out there.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember when he was lying on his couch with his face turned away from us, and sometimes he was lying for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he fired all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir's 17 today, he's taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was sure he was dead for hours and I'd never see him again.
When I got up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a hell of a chance to survive this.
“I remember screaming “Damire, run, run!” but I was convinced he did not hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of fear in Beslan
Comfort: The survivors of Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with her mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, at Grigorij's right today
When he was running out of his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was in his bloody face of fear.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beslan congregation.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school the first day, and had a rush to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my boy stayed there for three days alone,” she remembered.
Not alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
He only survived my Grigori.
When the date comes, it's still harder to think and talk about it.
There's not going to be a single day for us not to mention the tragedy.
We don't think it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Fotka Grigorije (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was visited as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigori was so excited about school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he was alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of the crying Grigory in San Marina.
Grigoriy's looking at the photo, and we're hiding it in the library.
I get it, but I also think that this picture makes people know what pain we feel all over the world.
Today Grigorij says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedys are still investigating, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something too bad.
“I don’t understand why it’s happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, as is possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little bit, he needs decades.
It was affecting my health, and I still feel it.
Three or four years I had nightmares because of the attack, but then things got better.
Then when I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why when it comes to September 1st, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and began to study medicine at the University of Vladikavkavka.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't do it for health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived, even though he was kept at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist during the attack, yet he could survive
When the attack was full of power, he was captured in the gym, sitting next to the bomb at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injury suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw behind my head.
Now I'm older and they say that kids with bad experiences can deal better - I have to say that's not true.
“ In 2006, I went to a psychologist, and then I felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year later - that was the first time and the last time I joined the gym again.
I passed out.
I'll never go there again and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Lifetimes: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photos taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me to school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful of my knee that I hurt, but I'm already going normal.
But I still couldn't get in for health and study at the FBS Academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.
I sent them my files, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My next promise is animals, so I got into a vet.
I finished the second year there.
Learns how to treat all animals from ‘cats to cows’
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something the kids should know about and not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will still be here.
He's inside and getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I'll take part in the commemorative ceremony.
I know Grigorii won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's a grown-up today, but he's moving on with the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so unrighteous happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knees.
He's been under some surgery, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that 50 percent of it's already gone through, but I can't get over it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and it only worses the pain.
I've lost a lot of people I've liked, and they've been close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift that God could give me, but I'm in pain of losing the killed.
I know families with other children born in, but also widows who have never been married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him at the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - war in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why kill each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one of the friends of the country, so how did we get to do that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been killed and will still be killed.
If we could just take all those rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took a special commander to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaev carries a secure Russian special commander (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all.
The world collapsed in 2004 when little Alyon brought in the arms of the Belslan captive Russian police officer.
The Terorists released her, but they left her 30-year-old mother in prison, Kristin's 10-year-old sister and brother Makhar.
The Makhar, which was three years old, escaped, escaped Alyon's mother and sister, however, died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and with her new wife, the girl who was named Kristina after his dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyon, who is now ten, doesn't even remember the attack and grew up being a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said that “it’s a very happy family and Alyon and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary reminds.
You can understand why.

4 tips, how to get better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera of the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at a family celebration of a couple of cameras, they cost them all less than 350 dollars.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tight.
Next, set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a stage or filming mode that optimises exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you get into it, see how deep you can go with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in a regular and waterproof design.
Do a few pictures always - a lot of them don't work.
The compact cameras have LCDs that will help you with your photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it's going to be hard to see underwater, and it's going to be invisible.
So always do more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different exposure distribution, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
He has a lot to do with the deep submarine of light.
If possible, stay close to the sea when taking pictures in the pool, lakes or seas.
This will also allow you to capture more light in photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's great advice if you take pictures of the land, but under water it's even more important because of the darker light.
It is especially important if you are filming an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide angle of lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to objects.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose power of personality could change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he explained his career to the patient to relieve the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors concentrate on diagnosis and illness, treated patients in a vast majority are interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was him who began to suffer.
“ I don’t feel in my skin, ” he wrote in May that year.
I felt powerless.
He was dealing with flu symptoms and found that she was impatient and his wife Juliet involved regrettably.
He noted: “I want things to happen sooner than later. ”
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and unexplained.
Something was wrong.
My friend's X-rayed his chest.
One week before, he was skiing in French Alps.
The X-rays came in.
He had mesothelioma, an irresistible tumor that affects the pombuds, or a lung leak.
It's hard for most cancers to determine what caused them.
Although some chickens get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
Mesotheliom is different.
Almost in all cases is the cause of exposure to asbestos - to building fibre material, which has previously been marked as “serious,” but today it is known that he is deadly.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelios.
Asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the use of asbestos in the industry has entered into force.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, only some groups of people came to close contact, such as the treasurers of isolation, construction workers, tesars and workers in the shipyards.
Toxin used in industry in another era today is difficult to appear as a reason to worry.
Such selfishness, but it's not in place.
As it turns out, there's a mesothelioma epidemic in Britain today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths on this disease per year are twice the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we only feel its effects now, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos have been banned in 1999), is that it usually lasts decades before the gaps develop.
The crisis in the form of mesothelioma does not affect only the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and in many cases he is still present in homes where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in stores where we buy.
Mesotheliom therefore does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileges from London's business houses to public schools do not represent hiding.
And Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even hospitals that should treat us are the storage site of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even say isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“ It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in Guy's Hospital's basement corridors, where I spent six years in practice, ” he wrote.
Everyone - students, sisters, doctors and doormen - used hallways.
The question is, how many of my presenters get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he could partially answer.
“With four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who later showed up to mesothelioma in the past five years, ” he noted in his letter in 2010, “I was the only one still alive. ”
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55.
Live with this diagnosis for so long is not normal.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “A lot of us get the same disease.
According to the British previous expert on Professor Julian Pet's mesothelioma, it is estimated that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is lost, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at the records from the archives of the courts which are often affected and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June has admitted to Marks & Spencer that she has given up the asbestos of Janice Allen.
For the string she worked for nine years, from 1978 to1987, when she watched two stores on the clothing section - one of the places was the flag ship of the company, the store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18, when she started working for M&S.
Today, he has two children who are over 20.
“ Before that, ” he says, “I have never heard of mesothelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I never even thought he might have talked to me in my dream.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name has been given thanks to his fibrillous structure, which gives him strength and flexibleness.
Of six minerals, three were used in construction.
Most often, it is possible to find chrysotil in buildings today, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seal and even brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO nevertheless consider it “the great health risk that can cause death.
More dangerous but is brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain once was the largest importer of brown asbestos and experts claim that “there is a convincing but indirect proof that this was the main cause of an unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Employee Marsk & Spencer has been exposed to a flag shop in Oxford Street London
Janice Allen may not consider himself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Peta's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His studies claim that “a substantial part of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or home were likely to be caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment”
A significant part of this exposure is due to the ‘current use and winding-up’ of buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people at the centre of the government may not have to believe that they may be exhibited asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the service elevators and pipelines behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibres could be broken by something as harmless as “the strong current of the air,”
Ministers are often accused of only taking care of their own interests, but in this case they may be the opposite of the truth.
Although the Directorate of Parliament’s Services insisted that the Westminster Palace should receive “a thorough medical certificate”, it is now estimated that one million pounds will be required and a few years of work will be required to take a close look at Parliament, to modernise the electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the elections in 2015 they will be members rather than on the green benches in Westminster sitting in the premises of Queen Elizabeth II’s Conference Centre.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations;
It is impossible to say whether this conflict will cost lives.
Everyone can now just wait.
One person who was never able to determine when asbestos was exposed to them is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected to have been exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
“ I worked in a hospital where asbestos was shown to be present, ” she says, “but in my case I cannot prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was dominated by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was just in the middle of an operation.
All of a sudden, I'm shaking.
It came at once.
I was so sorry.
I thought I wouldn't drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming out of the casserole, the femur around his lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe that this was a mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
The doctors got a chest X-ray on his chest and took his chest cacture off his lungs to remove the fluid that they sent to his lab.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms have returned, often after he's been practicing and breathed.
In 2011, he entered an operational hall of one of the Abbott patients with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott did not connect to his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older, and at work he got into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition worsened again and his physician consulted his CT images and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was put in the space between the prune of the chest cavity and the discharge of the lungs in a probe equipped with a camera.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take much,\" he says.
To be honest, I wasn't very worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, she was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: “They told me that it was a mesotheliom.
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with his sisters from Macmillan's charity organization and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It has been shown that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which have often asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline,” he says.
For people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
Mesotheliom is now starting to concern younger people who have no risk jobs.
The most dangerous pipes of thermally isolated asbestos were found in the basement in hospitals, so it was unlikely that patients would be threatened.
However, members of staff who have crossed the basement corridors between buildings (as Andrew Lawson) or at eating in basement dishes (as often as Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As is now shown, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could compromise the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos are removed until today.
The students built Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of their excellent insulation and unburnable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, a lot of asbestos were exposed to school.
Somewhere in the countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos pad.
There have been a website dealing with asbestos in schools.
The harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tools in our homes normally contained asbestos.
“One industrial poison built into a large number of houses, ” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer representing Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos was made by a woman suffering from mesothelioma, in the 1970 ’ s, in the wake of a garden house.
So be careful how you're hurting the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is irresistible, the impact of diagnosis is huge.
“It takes a while before you know it,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep trying, but I found out I can't focus on what I'm doing.
I was in the OR for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna make it for another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was to switch from a doctor's position to a patient's position.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
“ It was hard to understand everything, ” he says.
“ I asked my doctor: “How much time do I have left?
I was told that 12 months.
I remember thinking: “Well, I can't live another Christmas.
That's what it is.
Mesotheliom is particularly destructive because the mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos form small fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and fibers breathe in, they can be settled in a cassette, a pulmonary gasket.
Asbestos fibers are irritant and can trigger cell mutations.
“Problem represents the breathful asbestos fiber in the shape of a needle,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardiochirurg, who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxically leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the lungs' tissues, says Treasure, and “a self-spiration is pushing them to the edge of where there is a drawing.
From the very beginning, it's invasive.
The usual treatment options used for other types of cancers do not stop so much for mesothelioma.
There is, for example, an urgent discussion of the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say it would be worth an attempt.
Treasure disagrees.
“You can’t remove the threat,” he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
The cancer “not exactly responding to chemotherapy”, which although “has some effect, but does not cure.
“Someone who survives lung cancer occurs,” says Treasure.
But eventually they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became individual support and adviser to the same people.
When they called, the wedding introduced: “Good day, you reached the center of cancer.
“It was very positive,” says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning of Abbott, they offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last for four months and probably only last a month.
“I was desperate, ” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “ showed things in more optimistic light.
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdusky from the department of the chest surgery at Guy's Hospital Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I had not to wait for them to send me to him, but I only called there, and they looked at me,” admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a student and they would have to approve his payment.
In order to get to the best available treatment, there is a key issue for patients with mesothelioma patients.
But when different treatments eventually fail, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family that they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“ Since 1898 asbestos has known that health is harmful,” says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even very small amounts of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet with corporate negligence.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled out, but according to Morgan, it was not “full-value settlement,” because Lawson could not definitely prove that the mesotheliom was the result of exposure to asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation of the case, however, the spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that “the asbestos in an incriminated basement section was removed in the 1990s”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
A single company or place of work, usually tens of years after it happened, has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workers have changed owners or broken.
Insurance records are lost.
And those who defend themselves now have time on their side, which is certainly not their prosecutors.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to be able to agree, even if their former employer cannot be monitored.
The law has created a 350 million financial reserve to be paid to insurance companies, which is designated to people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but do not have anyone to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80 % of the amount to be allocated to them in a normal case by the court as compensation - approximately £ 120 000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as in patients with mesothelioma, thinks that £ 350 million is “good work, ”
“It is a deal written by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they hadn’t hit time and people with mesothelioma would be able to reach the former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “he had gaps.
But Penning and Morgan admits that due to seven deaths every year, there was a need for rapid negotiations.
“The people need too much pain and help immediately,” Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended Lang-Lazdinski an operation that, unlike Tom Treasura, he thought had a positive effect.
Following surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed - triple therapy that Lang-Lazdunski may boast of a five-year survival rate to 40% of patients.
Abbott's enhanced it.
“It’s not the most important thing, of course,” says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition may get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott stepped up an operation in March 2012.
He finished the last six cycles of chemotherapy at the end of August.
Check did not show any signs of illness.
I went to another inspection in March [2014].
I had several spots in my chest [crowding].
My 50th birthday just got closer.
It doesn't threaten life.
He's taking it.
Abbott once again stepped up six cycles of chemotherapy.
Currently there are no traces of tumor in his body.
But it's physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think of practical things-- to financial security, when I die or to show a woman how a boiler alarm works.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents, ” he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant that I would never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is a lot of social and wild.
She told her friends, and then we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more sustainable.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face these conversations.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such interviews are not subject to hope or just a sign of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and ultimately brought Stephen Jay Gould) an indecent certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “life rules do not threaten ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
Despite the increasing debate on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominated candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will produce long-term promising protests in Hong Kong business district, as activists have begun to organize and catch only a few hours after this notice.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate that is not loyal to Beijing.
“We were not surprised, but it upset us,” said the legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritative regime.
At the defense of China's decision, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee on National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's election would be “chaos”
Since 1997, when Britain has returned Hong Kong management, Beijing promises that the population will be able to vote for effective power from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders have presented Sunday decisions as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct vote, but it also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders hold firm in the hands of the nomination process of the Committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clauses, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong will be allowed.
The decision came after summer months, which recorded one of Hong Kong's biggest and most observed protests in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are held by the occupation of the Central Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened with the closure of the financial quarter if Beijing does not grant them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, only a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement in the rain gathered before Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers told us that their movement enters a new stage of civil disobedience and that there will be a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “sacred the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must regret to announce that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the establishment of the Centre is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday they have strengthened the protection of government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Inciting anxiety is a sign that many Hong Kong residents are slowly losing control of the city.
The use of land-based people increases competition in products and services.
They are also concerned that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being enriched by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the occupation movement and say that their demonstrations threaten the trade - rescue boat Hong Kong.
“The protest he is talking about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long,” says Ms. Regina Ip, who criticizes the movement for the long term.
We don't want Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
Chinese state media has also come up in recent days with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong are drawing up as subversive agents controlled by the West.
During the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780 000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the biggest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
A electoral agitator?
The League in Jihlava wears name according to political movement
He plays about 1,600 amateur sportsmen in the region city of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is now called the Common League for Jihlava.
The name was given by one movement that goes into October's municipal elections.
In addition, ten on his candidate is the boss of the small kicked in Jihlava Jan Mák.
“There was a general meeting where no problem was involved,” Máka said.
The situation around the first leagues of small kickings was already addressed by lawyers of the South Town Hall and recommended a change in the subsidy distribution system.
A small cognac won around a million crowns last year, according to the city website.
This year, it's a hundred thousand.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of small copies is not contrary to the law or the provisions of the magistrate.
However, the situation is for the Authority to apply the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies,” said Radek Tulis spokesperson.
To steal subsidies from the city, and to express at the same time as a small kick-out support in elections of one political party, I don't think that's gonna happen anymore.
A similar requirement for politicians has not yet come to the vysočina-big football.
That the ČSSD would have been created by the National Recruit, ODS Division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for that.
On the contrary, I would like to see the sponsors turn to us from a number of companies,\" said President of the Miroslav Vrzáček Regional Football Union.
The head of the little football other sides and the movement to the name of the league won't let go
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own premises with six playgrounds, dressings and social facilities.
“For example, the field is not ours, we are there in rent,” said Ondřej Lapeš of Starlet Jihlava's Club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
There, for example, will be built in my opinion in the sense of the absurd area for the skiers, which is about 50 in Jihlava, - pointed out Morak.
Primator Jihlava Jaroslav Clear (ODS) responded that a small hilly uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupa, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernise or build a sports centre at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think he's made huge progress for a small kick in recent years,” he added.
Other political parties in the names of leagues do not appear according to John Panaks.
We have limitations.
If one of us enters one of the fields, the other is no longer there,” he explained.
“Policy movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step,” said a member of the Council Board for sport Karel Voldán.
“But let the voters decide whether Mr. Morak uses the Little Coated Society of Jihlava and city subsidies for political purposes or not,” he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - fresheners can fly through a jet plane
We are pleased that we can respond to demand by launching the first luxurious travel services for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best income on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including private jets or Rolls-Royce Phontom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service had its security website.
Servis is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to lure their things over the entire state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that, with our VIF (very important fresher - very important element) variants of this year, students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
The speaker said that since the services had only begun, they have no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks -
The company also stated that although students are paying an annual school of £9 000, they expect the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, there are other students today with regard to expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIP program is exactly the right way to learn it.
But the National Union criticized students' service as unsatisfied.
Megan Dunn, the vice president of the Union for higher education, noted: “For most students, such a project is inconceivable.
Many students who enter the university this month must, before they throw thousands of pounds out for something as simple as getting to the track, cope with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with rising costs for basic needs.
The feminists are following events in Ferguson against racism and police behavior.
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
So they wait for the funeral with their hands up scandalously: “Do not shoot up! ”
After two weeks of protests in the Ferguson in Missouri due to the shooting of an unarmed young Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in the online discussions of the Belarusian feminist.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex before the race.
With increasing tension in the Middlewest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the white reaction was 100% concentrated on the race.
As compared to the reactions of the black man soon after the shooting on August 9, the personal articles of the Foundation as “the thought of white men over Ferguson, or “Feminism is not only about women’s oppression,” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, it is an important change.
“I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privileges at such a level,” she said.
People felt that what had happened must express themselves.
For the crisis that we face, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially won that they had to draw attention to it.
According to English professors at the University of Ohio Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-Americans must face every day and which are not perceived as “woman’s questions” in culture.
“I can publish on Facebook funny stories from my life with my partner and it gets 150 pounds from people around the world,” Mitchell said.
If I write something about the coloring in their own country in a trap, it's a silence depressing.
“How is it possible that a woman can publicly talk about relationships, but not public security,” she asked.
For black people like Mitchell, who have dealt with the question of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no difference between the issues of race and sex dipotomy.
The Black Ones said that they could not give luxury an overview of the following problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although the white women today are combining the question of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of female question and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason was almost in all cases the rape of whites,” Hatery said.
To justify lynching you needed a white man's cooperation.
According to Hatery's divorce between white and black people, only one group of people - women or blacks could have had a vote against Susan B. Anthony.
“They decided to put the card on women’s voting right and to focus on black people’s right later,” explained Hattery.
When we realize this, we will gain important insight into why colored women don't believe in white women.
We haven't done a good job.
We've never helped black men protect their husbands and children.
Even after women in 1920 gained the election law, it took ten years to organize a lynching against the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of lynching.
The group was formed for 40 years after the blacks first called for help.
Mitchell said that the reaction of white feminists to questions that were raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “do the question of which black women were dealing with generations.
“It would not be great if activists in these areas [the traditional feminism] were given the right to raise a child as seriously as they were taking the right to birth on birth control”, Mitchell.
The second wave of feminist who did the career of fighting for reproductive law and access to birth control, now they find out what that means.
The prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown by a Facebook attack, where they published the column Rebecca Carroll from Guardian who demanded white Americans to protest against racism.
“I hope that women who have different, but still similar grounds for understanding the dangers of society - and the views of the race that differ significantly in public opinion surveys - will seek a change,” Stein wrote.
Although Steinem becomes intersexual feminism, which includes race and gender issues, its comments on the question of the race in America are some of the mothers.
The American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book “He who stole feminism”, said She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “some more vulnerable than their sisters, but the notes of Stein’s side of Ferguson face the criticism that had already caused.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for the boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother's Keeper, who was supposed to help vulnerable young black people and Hispanics, it resulted in many feminists including Gloria Stein's angry reaction.
The relationship between police and the black community is not the only problem that gets to the top of the interest of Maintream feminism.
After the US border police held this year in the Southwest of almost 66,000 youths without an escort, the issue of the reform of immigration laws was again raised - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercado, co-chaired by We Belong Together, the organisation of the mobilisation of women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to address the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
“He speaks for himself,” says Mercad.
Given that most working permits are granted to men, women who come with them are in a position where they are vulnerable as regards domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have aloud in women’s organizations,” she said.

It's the main subject, and they're all upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.

Deutsche Bahn Trains won't leave tonight.
Troopers want higher wages
The GDL in the press release marked protest as a warning strike for which he specifically chose time outside of the traffic tip.
GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend after the railway until the first day of work.
At the same time, we think of people arriving for work during the day,” said the union on Monday morning in the press statement on the statement of stasis.
“Our first strike should hit mainly freight transport, less passengers,” added the GDL.
DB has not yet published an official response to the announcement of the strike.
It is not even clear how protest actions will touch international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The Departments require an increase of five percent of the pay gap of the engine and a two-hour reduction of working time per week.
At present, the average salary of drivers is between 36 000 and 46 thousand euros (998 000 and 1,27 million crowns) per year.
Officers at DB are working 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to contribute to wage growth in the short time of working time.
They stress that the wage assessment of train drivers must be developed as well as the other railway staff for which DBs do not count in breaking the working week.
It was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why Barum rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be provably fixed and proceed at a slower pace to service where the mechanics would change it?
If we went straight down there, yes.
But there were still two more plants waiting for us, and that didn't work.
There's a high temperature in it and the risk that the car would start to burn, it was big.
I can't afford that.
You've done five speed tests at full speed.
What were you impressed with?
Very good.
I felt like a glitch.
We were quick, and I didn't go through the wine.
Everything was caused by drinking the car for more than six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You drove him off so you could really think about winning.
I made the car myself, too, so we really had to win.
Work didn't come in.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought about has not been reached.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, technology said no.
You weren't the only one out of the tip who had temporarily resigned from the fight for firsthand.
They fell out of him and foreign favorites of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Were you surprised that so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
Especially for the audience it was a shame, because the race ended early.
Also Jaromír Tarabus, which you're preparing for.
But he paid to get off the track and pick up almost a two-minute man.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he might have repeated the degree of winners.
I mean, he's been running out of time for the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that we got the car well.
He was driving very fast.
You reported the end of your career exactly a year ago, but you showed up at Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again make a regular participant in the rally races?
Not at this point.
Last year, I said Barumka was my last race, and I still couldn't keep it.
I decided I'd drive her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's another chance in a year, I guess I'll do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have come to the track just because of you.
Did it please you?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What do you expect from Barumka?
The team continues.
We'll go to Vyštava next week where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow Honza Sýkora for this race from us.
We are facing a European double in Switzerland and Korsice with Mira.
That's what we're gonna have to catch up to next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Korsický rallye belonged to the World Championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Doesn't it bother you to try that track again?
She's not.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not allow a doctor to issue a certificate of incapacity that serves as evidence for the organisation that you cannot carry out working duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the employer.
However, there was an agreement that the days would be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation in writing to confirm the consent of the employer with the drawing-up of leave, in practice this procedure has proved to be valid.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation agreement.
Later, it may be alleged consent to the drawing of leave, as in your case, denied and absence at work assessed as a long-term non-exclusive absence, therefore the reason for the immediate cancellation of the working relationship pursuant to § 53 of the Labour Act.
In case of a court dispute about your appointment with your employer, you lack proof.
However, the working relationship with you was not cancelled according to § 53, only you have the days shown in the credit note as an unexplained absence.
The unexplained absence in the budget paper does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the possibility of collecting material security in unemployment), yet it is the difficult possibility to find a new job.
We recommend you to visit your doctor again and to confirm in writing that there has actually been an accident as a result of which you have been unable to work (this is not just a doctor’s document).
When looking for a new job, you can submit the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the submission of a written medical certificate of disability and the close notification of the employer or the request of written consent with the drawing of leave.
You avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident when he returned to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a little bit behind the mid-range Atlantic Motor Speedway raceway.
Stewart ran into the edge twice after he was in 172. wheel of the right front tire, and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove a broken car to the garage, didn't give up on the reporters and left.
Head of his team Chad Johnston said that car team 14 is disappointed, but he will now focus on a race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
\"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion,\" said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we're going to hope for more.
Stewart first ran into playing in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which sought to correct the right side of his car.
“ Until today’s race, ” Johnston said, “It did not work out.
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and he needed to win it either a race in Atlanta or next race in Richmond to catch up in the table.
He returned to racing during the investigation of a tragic accident in which he died of a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into the road during the race.
The authorities said that the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
He hasn't decided to face any accusations yet.
A triple champion had a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started at 12th place at the beginning of the race he worked for 10th and then even 4th.
After that, at the beginning of 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, ran out of the second corner and hit Stewart, which sent both cars to the toy.
Stewart continued, but he went back to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague completed the selection procedure for the new taxi station manager.
For 103 parking stops, about 12.3 million crowns per year.
Until recently, in the same place for taxi car drivers, she collected 150 000 crowns a year.
He informed Councilman Luke Manhart about it (TOP 09).
The former city used to draw the managers.
The winner then won a rental for a flat-rate sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
At present, he decides the amount of the offer.
The new lease system is far more favourable for Prague and more generally fairer, says the councilman.
The most expensive spot is in Perštyn
The highest prize was offered by all interested parties on the station in Perštýn Street.
She'll pay 2.1 million a year.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by new administrators for places before the General House or Václav Square.
The new rules for the acquisitions of taxi stations were adopted by the Council in autumn 2012 and the original rental contracts in the summer of last year.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 posts.
Second time, we had to clean the well this year.
We released it all every time, creating practically another pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo there.
An incredible smell!
Our well in the basement was always enough beautiful scented water.
And it wasn't someone who was trained to do it, it was evicted by his grandfather.
A long time ago.
She was just in three shorts and totally self-evident, like everything in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the flight.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
When she was standing there for months, she deserved it.
But then we thought the water didn't smell like it.
We were wondering if there was anything in there.
In a place where the pump went through, it was possible with a little bad luck, there was no way to fly, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing in the water to see, and we opened it all the way down.
So we released her again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we've improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed some weird things in the basement.
He was lying on the ground with some ankles.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a bit of a mouse.
By the ceiling, in places where the glides, the granddad's inventions were the remains of the fish!
And they're heavy!
Our basement's also self-evident.
Someone would have said that Grandpa simply subset the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far away from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only strangled with sand, only the ceiling is broken.
They're mostly shiplifting.
And wheels.
And she's on the beach.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open, as someone went there in one piece.
Several of the previously mentioned passages to the ceiling.
Without the nets, they usually fly birds there and build a nest on the beams.
There's no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to work out, and that's it again.
But now he didn't even help the luft.
I smelled the whole cellar.
So we cleaned the entire cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw out the things that were around: the board, the heraklite board, and so on.
Our cottage in the distance was welcome by a disinfectant.
We were wondering who could have pulled the disgusting remains out there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It's hard for her to come to us.
Grandpa attacked one neighbor who's not completely okay.
If that Franta didn't fuck us with the grossness?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to watch the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far, just washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Making water out of the forest wells is nothing I want to do for a long time.
We once heard a terrible anxiety brush of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a strong black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The rose has jumped over her and laundered like a fool.
My mom invented it because she thought Rez had taken the garbage hose out of the sink.
All of a sudden, the hose was partly stuck in the club and partly bonded.
At the balcony, it's down to the sky.
Rez got hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
The flow, the long way across the subway and the fat as a bulldozer, was going to swallow a huge oil, and Réza defended it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the oil or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the crowd saw the sleepover in the form of our whole family, she probably thought we'd eat it when we were hungry, and she was elegantly passing through the door to the basement.
We followed her.
Like lightning jumped in the well.
We just, by the way, recorded another tadpole on her board.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little shaky.
And we closed the basement for the day.
That he'd...
We went out there, and we're all stuck to one of our breaths.
We haven't waited long.
It was fucked up in the well.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on her neck appeared.
Then she got fired at the well all over again.
She got around the pump and started getting inside.
Disappeared employee got revenge, bought a laptop on the company, and sold it to them.
A burned employee bought a computer company after release and then sold them.
The money received has been spent before the police were arrested.
During a short time, a man bought in twelve cases a total of 16 computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
After taking over, he went to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaar,” said the Chief Commissioner of Cyprus, Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for fraud was the employer's bridge for release and also the profit of money.
In the hearing, he claimed that he had used the money to pay off the loans, said Brückner.
Police have also found out that the fraud is a pathological player who has repeatedly treated the psychiatrist.
So money could also end up in winning instruments or video terminals.
“The fact is that we did not find any money in him,” the Commissioner said.
A suspect who has been punished for theft has now threatened to stay in prison for one year to five years.
So far, the police have not told whether the penalty is also at risk of the basaltics that have bought the notebooks at the price and sold them further.
“It is true that they have taken over all new goods, which is at least suspicious,” said the Commissioner.
However, none of the blar owners have been charged yet.
Come on, a little bit more, you can do it, or as I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared some changes for us.
This was the biggest change in the route that brought the target to the flood instead of leading back to the Yellow bath.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of Rungo.cz the team, but I was going to go through it a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took photographs and recorded videos together.
To make my point on the other side perfect, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
With my friend Káťa, we had just before the start, we had a decent place at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted our friends who were walking past us into a sector for faster runners.
There's not much time left.
Couple of heat jumps, turn on the athletes, count and start!
Isoth screams, but instead of a quick start, there was a swing to the starting line.
After five minutes, we take the gate, turn the measurements, and start at a rate of 10 an hour.
We sail with a yellow snake of runners who, like the Stone, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun on the sky adds a view of Vyšehrad almost to the ecclesiastes.
The pulsating mass moving on the coast looks like Prague's running around here.
The coast between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre is traditionally beginning to express who has the power.
A light dome on Palacki Square forces many runners to slow down or pass into a walk.
I see police escorts shortly before crossing to Divadelová, and immediately after him, Vzek Pavizta is flying an incredible pace towards the target.
I can hear the admirable inflated exhalation of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to be talking to me, but just before my leg gets dirty and our hands are close to mine.
The theatre street season gives you a chance to relax and breathe.
There's room ahead of us where the view will blow my breath.
The swelling on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the falling sun.
I'm not breathing, and my feet are almost alone.
There's a moment of truth for the first freshman.
During the crossing of the road, Káť's schooling about the curb and conducting a swimmer leap.
I'm watching if he doesn't need help, and I'm starting a series of encouraging words so that she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues with the Kozí alley, it is one of the longest places of the line, although there is no longer such a rush at this stage, yet it is necessary to follow the surrounding area well.
I don't know yet that the concept of the longest place gets its true meaning later.
After the Prague gate, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to get laid with anyone who's offering his hand, and I'm going to advise Kata because the ten squeezing with fans is like half an energy bar.
It's working, we're speeding up again, and if we've fallen a lot, now we've started a trucking ride.
When I have someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: ‘Come, a little bit more, you can do it.’
We're not running anywhere near the last freshman, we're going to go faster.
So far, we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but you really need to make a big move.
The sun is slowly over, and the end of the day slowly finishes the race.
The last run on the bridge, the turn, and it's just a plane to target.
The temperature we're running, I wonder where it's coming from in that girl?
- Come on, we're going under 13 o'clock, ma'am, I'm calling.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's the target.
It's 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can I do?
Coach gave up an hour limit of 20.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just for the purpose of breaking down the legs, I help her to the rail where she rests for a while.
There's a blackout on it, but there's also happiness in the well-maintained performance.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of target space.
Euforia doesn't let us think about pressures in passages to the wardrobe.
Here we can see that Kozí Street wasn't the deadliest place.
That's what's behind the target of a flood that's under the impression of nearly ten thousand runners incited to crack.
If anyone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for him.
Even after a while, I'm losing my head and wondering if those beautiful views and the more interesting route was worth what was going on in the finish line.
I know from my own experience that the race is no fun.
If ten thousand people join this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the whole centre of Prague for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year's change in the route showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere, pumped in the Yellow baths, was transferred between the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random viewers were taking her on every foot of the track.
Unfortunately, at the urban run, the historical centre must count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but the destination of the mass race in a place bordered by the wall and on the other side of the river is not considered the best solution.
If I say that the race has ended by running the target, I will evaluate it as a very successful one.
I had a little fear of the health of the involved, but it all worked out well.
Write us in the discussion if you like the route and what you're saying about the situation in the target.
Prison overseers in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prisoners throughout Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest assembly before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
The peaceful demonstrations repeated their demand to reintroduce the original working conditions that have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov is also higher wages.
During the month, the governors were symbolicly protesting against the new working hours and demanding a return to the original twenty-four hours shift.
Although prison overseers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) was informed.
“One continues,” said BNR Head of the Directorate-General for Prison Services Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Organisations in the Ministry of Interior will also join the protests of prison services.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
Physics usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University made a shot in black in 1999.
His book Elegant Space has become the most accessible way for lay girls to penetrate the violin problems that many theoretical physicists are currently dealing with today - trying to unite two perfectly functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the elegant universe is that, in the case of finding a united physical theory, it is not a boring story.
Physical fundamental problems between two key theories (although at this moment our universe de facto is divided into two worlds with different laws) have been addressed and solves so strongly that it is worth overcoming even laiks.
Greene also advised himself with the complex material so much fresh and sadly that it cannot be calculated how much interesting he did not have included in his book.
In addition, his “choyb” was made up of two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently, neither the author would object to taking his book faster, but the fact is that after 15 years, the elegant universe still provides almost everything that a informed lay with ambition should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the coming years, there will be only a little bit more living in this area (the third because the LHC accelerater will finally go to the “full gas” - and so it is good time to enter Greene's open door of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, weird or mystical.
Yet it is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our sight away from space for a moment as a whole for something more groundy, specifically for a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that a hundred meters garden hose is drawn from one side of the canon to the other and the entire scenery is followed by a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance you easily record the long in the horizontal direction of the drawn hose, but if you do not suffer sharpness, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given your great distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where he was an ant at a given moment, you will answer him only one piece of information: the distance of ants from the left (or the right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from half a mile away, it looks like a long piece of hose as a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we expand everything, we will see suddenly the second dimension - in the shape of a circle that is flying the hose.
In this enlarged view, it is clear that an antler can actually move in two independent dimensions: in already well-known left-right dimension after the length of the hose, but also in the direction of the movement of the hour's arms, i.e. around the circular diameter of the hose.
You're beginning to understand that to determine the position of a little ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle of a flying hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is double-dimensional (i.e. the experts will see that this chapter concentrates purely on the disruptive theory of string.
The non-circumvention aspects are covered by Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is double-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, is short and bold.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The distance along the hose is long and easy to see.
The size of the lighting circuit hose is short, “invigorated” - and worse significant.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to explore the hose with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates the important features of spatial dimension.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be either large, vast, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary, small, guilty, and much worse observed.
Of course, in the present case, we have not just resolved to be a “vintum” - the dimension of the flying hose thickness revealed.
It was enough to take a long look at it.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capilára - we would only reveal it with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he interrupted with a stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions.
Kaluza’s radical claim justified the fact that an additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be contained in a single, unified concept.
At once, the question of how this Kaluz observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza thought was between the lines and which he made clear and specified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and sinister dimensions.
This means that as a dimension in the direction of length of the hose, our universe also has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize every moment.
But analogically with a circular garden hose, the universe may have an additional dimension, firmly attached to the space so tiny that they have remained hidden even before our most advanced experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluzu's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine, on the circuit of the hose, we will draw a black color with a relatively thick range of circlers.
Looks like a hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With a long look at the drawing, we will reveal the increased dimension of the dimension even easier, because we will see the motive from Figure 2.
Obviously, we see that the surface of the hose is double-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the second short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came along with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, i.e. a four-space dimension.
It's difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination, let us see the illustrations on Figure 3; shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we increase the view of the geometry of the space similar to that of we increasing the surface of the hose.
Each following level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they are brought into enough small space; we are thus explaining that we have not yet observed them directly.
The Čtverce network depicts commonly known - large - dimension, while the circle is new, small and guilty of dimension.
Just as loops threaded in a dense carpet, even these circlers exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we only covered them in square nets because of their visibility.
Background of Figure 4 shows the common well-known structure of space - the common world around us - in such common meters as the meters marked by the small square in the square network.
In each of the following images we will focus on the small area of the picture preceding; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at several first levels of enlargement.
But when we proceed on our way behind the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - to the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 -, we see suddenly new, into the shape of the circle with the dimen, similar to the strings of the thread in the thickly woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came along with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of the hose circular circuit at each point of its length.
In the interests of clarity, we have only covered the circular dimension in some of the regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 of Kluzov and Klein's idea of a microscopic structure of geometry summarizes the space.
Similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also record important differences.
Firstly, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we drew only two), while the hose has a large dimension only one.
The more important difference is that we are talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If an additional circular bloated dimension is extremely miniature, to recognize it is - as well as the circular circuit hose - much harder than to observe obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be exposed to the strength of our most advanced tools for enlargement.
Most important, however, is that an additional dimension is not just a narrow cup within normal dimensions, as a two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
Blood dimension is a new dimension, which exists at every point of three common large dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent, such as the dimensions of top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and round) each other.
A sufficiently small antler could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine his position, except for three common yet position in circular dimension; if we count the time, then data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Are you curious?
You can buy the Book of the Elegant Space Brian Greeen here on the books.idnes.cz.
The price for e-book is 149 CZK.
To our surprise we therefore find that we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, shows Kalus and Klein’s thinking that this does not exclude the existence of additional sinted dimensions if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognise the structure of a large billionth of meter.
We can barely observe a smaller, formidable dimension.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluzu's idea with several ideas from just the birthing quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could have a size of approximately one Planck's length, that is, the size of the size of today's instruments.
Since then, the physicists have called for additional minor spatial dimensions of Kleuzová-Klein's theory.
Fight Honza Homola advises how to practice on an electric guitar: 5.
The whole concept of the two measures consists in a twelve-year harmonic form that you can repeat whenever possible.
Whoever's in music theory will find her principle detailed here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
A puppet and a puppet, whose Facebook profile can be monitored here, is alive from graduation 20 years ago as a graphic.
He's a guitarist of the Wohn band, which I'm afraid he can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father as well as Brother Matej, leader of the Wohns.
Start training on one string.
“The practical model is on you only, you can think of anything, then you can apply it to the harmonic model of the 12th,” advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen to Honzu, what can happen to the 12th harmonica on two strings, and how it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already kick some songs with melodies.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change of scaffolding, Honza warns in the video.
Next time, Honza's going back to the pentatonica, and you're gonna try to get her together with the 12th.
So exercise it honestly.
As best as possible, you will learn that in an interview with Jane Homol at his first school game on an electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, acknowledges the castle yard
We're taking points and we're happy for him.
The first half of us, the second home, had more chances than one of us, was to fix the attacker, who used to score out of a fine dome this time.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, you know, he was accompanied by a huge sandstone?
I didn't particularly notice it, even though the second goal, where domestic fans are, would probably be worse.
You settled the penalty in half an hour, but you also received a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, and it came from the corner, and it was penalta after him.
After her, you went up and the first half of you were a better team who had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've played the incased goal until the break is well.
In the cabin we thought we wanted to keep the game pace, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the domestics had said something to their game about the break, they probably weren't very happy with her.
You only stabbed at the opponent's playground for the first time, while maybe you didn't get a goal at home yet.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's such a difference, it's more of a matter of how we do it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was wrong of us, Plzen, that's another category.
Four games you've been waiting for the goal, you weren't afraid it could be similar after the last game?
I don't think so, but, of course, we're glad we haven't had to talk about waiting for the goal since last game.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which isn't for a big hug yet.
Iceland - the lava flows from a mile away crater.
The cable flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnáökull iceberg is flowing through the underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
This one is located under the fridge, as well as a part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact is now worrying the most...
The situation for now remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still leaves the puckin about the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but-only 300-400 m3.
Compared to previous August of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could also open in places below ice.
If this happened, in addition to the same intensity as the current era, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökullum and on the other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulphur in the area of the erupce, and there is a cloud of steam and gases from the cracks.
It is certainly not an erupce suitable for tourist movement, as it was in the case of erupce at Fimvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger, and there is also much more gas, says Vulcanologist Armann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has been significantly improved since yesterday, in the early hours it was almost unconscious in the area.
The tracks after the sandstorm were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange degree (two highest) applies to Bárðarbung and yellow (third) for Ascju.
Heaven over Chebe belonged to the courageous Lady Peggy.
She went through the wings.
Air day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 air-conditioning acrobat of Peggy Waltin, which came out of the cocpit to the edge on the upper wing of a two-leaf and also between the wings.
That's where it's dedicated only to the strength of muscles.
The summer day in Cheb was already on the post-war and the organizers were able to prepare some interesting air pieces again.
The premiere of the oldest Czech airport has not only been left on wings - in the submission of German acrobats Peggy Waltinová, but also the legendary P-51 Dustang and Beechcraft aircraft 18.
He's the one who drew his eyes on himself with his brightness.
The acrobat called Wingwalking has its origin in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to do so.
But because of a large number of deaths, he was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of flight days.
Peggy will come out of the cocktail on the top wing after the launch.
It's where he's showin' all kinds of moves.
At the end of the performance, he moved to the space between the wings of the aeroplane, where her show continues,\" said Luděk Matěček from the Chebian Ultralight Club and the air day organizer.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main nail of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The Legendary Traitor joined the area with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so called on numbers).
Such a set could be seen by flying fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sazavsky then demonstrated the breathtaking acrobation with the aircraft from 1945.
Made in the war, but probably never participated.
It was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963, he worked in a civilian sector.
Even as a racer.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
In the same place there is also another pearl of the Cheb Air Day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expieditor.
There was no way to overlook the massive machine at the airport.
His polished aluminium tension shrouded into the distance.
He also gained Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French Air Force.
A small transport plane jumped behind a detached Turbot and from the German Hofu brought a part of the German air delegation on the day.
German neighbors took place in Cheb with renovated planes like 18T or three-member forms of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic back in front of the camera!
The parent's concerns changed Lucie Borhy at least for the work tonight.
Stress or neurosis-- blond moderator doesn't know any of this clearly.
She had a good time moding television news, like she didn't stop for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended on a six-day period in which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not show himself regularly in the main news account of TV Nova.
Regular return awaits her according to information Lightning.cz until next month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs more than television audiences.
Lucie Borhy returned to her TV screen, and it was a black shot.
Exhibition in Prague for a year?
Hala would sell herself out. I'm planning to say good-bye to Jigger.
It would be worth it if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how to build a union,” he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called Gold play, in which again a wonderful naganian team met.
Even the players who participated in the gold hattrick.
Players would like it, wouldn't they?
I'm sure.
It would be good to say goodbye to the gold generation during the championship.
I think they can find one two days during the tournament when it's completely free and where such a game could be hanging out.
We're gonna tell Gum (Jire Šlégr) or Béď Šzerban (the organizer of the South Chamber game) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell.
But what if you play with New Jersey playoff?
So if I fly in...
But you don't want to play representation.
Or did the Southern Meeting change your decision somehow?
Representations and exhibition games are two different things and the representations are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but performances are decisive, especially at world championships.
There should drive the players who have a good name for it, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you actually enjoy that naganian reunion?
It's just that meeting with the players was great.
You're alive with stories and you've had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
Of course, the most important thing was to honor Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey, and that there's a generation that really cost it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Rose and Petr Čechmánek on the syringe.
Are you still having your first representation game?
He doesn't forget that kind of thing.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holek and Robert Reichel, we joined in one three.
For everyone it was the first representational start.
Well, that we'd dominate in some way, you can't say that.
In Jihlava after a long time, Dominik Hašek was caught.
What did you say to his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me in the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagra for the reasons he decided to end up in representation).
Even Hnilika showed up great.
You were trained with me once in the night, and there he was a bitch.
And now he's caught himself famous.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, football players begin to quantify
A prominent guests were on Monday morning to laughter NH Hotel.
People could have seen Peter Čech's goalkeeper from Chelsea, a representative coach of Pavel Vrb...
And over there, the character in the black hat, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The Warden Arsenal and the captain of representation arrived at the meeting around half the 12th between the last.
We've got a beautiful fight against the Netherlands.
Who would not be pleased, said, when he had already preceded the journalist in the representation kit.
Czech representation program
Monday 1 September: beginning of the encounter, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Trenink open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiad (20:00)

Russian and spol. They can support fans before the Wednesday fight against the US (20:15).
The presentation opened Tuesday training for them, which starts at the Summer at 6:30 p.m.
After him will follow an autograph that will not be missed by Russian or Czech Republic.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be more calm.
Which he commends Coach Vrba, who was complaining about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we are dedicated to what we want.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so long,” praised Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will be accompanied by a Musketeers image when entering the new qualification cycle.
He's got three games under Vrbo, all ready.
With Norway and Finland, she remanded 2:2 and lost to Austria 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's it now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification of the procedure for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, the Czech manhood would help if even the general were against the US.
The first half of it was for us to meet each other.
Now there are important results.
We need to think about being successful,” Vrba agreed.
The only player who's a 32-year-old nominee who has a medical problem is the attacker David Lafata.
He's getting pregnant.
If he wasn't able to heal until the Wednesday fight against the United States, Coach Vrba would have called for another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after bad diagnosis for many years.
After diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her growing up thinking that she only had a few years of life left.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The Charitarian Organization of CMT UK has said that poor diagnosis is common among people with CMT because there is little knowledge of disease.
In the United Kingdom there are approximately 22,000 people suffering from CMT, which can show symptoms in the field of motorcycles such as muscle weakness, immersive walk and broken toes.
In the case of affected, there may also be insensitive or pain, this condition is inadvertent and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse in time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freudreich ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrates her 18th birthday, she'd be strapped on a wheelchair and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer.
I could never ride my bike skates with the other kids, and I was bullied at school because I was walking and running.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, and she was after several operations that were supposed to release her Achille's tendons and straighten her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room, and she looked into her file, where she found out that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I promised, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I sought information on the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I totally panicked.
I thought before I was 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and before I was fifty, I'd be dead, and in the meantime I'd lose all my skills.
I was on my own and I was planning a funeral.
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk didn't get as bad as she expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up and hugged her and said: “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, or else you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous,
After a few genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a puppy child,” she said.
The CMT UK Charitative Organisation has launched a month of information on CMT to draw attention to this disease.
Businesses in Washington: Taxes are taxed
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation of companies in the country with the acceleration of economic recovery last year slightly increased and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businessers in Maryland and Virginia, together for the fiscal year 2013, took $27.6 billion to state and local treasures, which is 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burdens - state and local - have increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and were the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to the study conducted by the professional company Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local contributions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56 %, is from the trade tax, and 36 % of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows a proportionally smallest tax income from business.
Researchers claim that the majority of tax revenues growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which tax on real estate this year after three consecutive years with growth -1% increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is also in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid over ten billion dollars last year on both state and local real estate taxes, which compared with 9.6 billion in 2012 accounted for an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, a clear increase in real estate value is not so much to raise state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax represents less than five years of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax is almost half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, he owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the base of tax in the area of D.C., government or non-profit organisations that do not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
Recent increases in corporate tax revenues cannot only be attributed to a healing real estate market.
According to data, business income is also increasing.
Companies in this region have published a 2,3 billion tax on corporate income which has increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has chosen one billion dollars on corporate income taxes, most in the region.
Although they are taking the same course, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average, at 4.3% while Maryland growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was an increase in taxes on average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest taxation of business income, 6 % from all three circuits (all of which have the same taxes).
The level of corporate taxation in Maryland is 8,25 %, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, at 9,975 %.
A similar study conducted this year by the American Chamber of Commerce has shown that Virginia has a lower state and local taxation and generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't report.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax will be reduced to 5% next year.
If the State continues to meet the income target in the coming year, the law set by the rate of taxation of revenue could decrease to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study with small entrepreneurs in Washington, it is better, and therefore pays higher state and local taxes.
A living tax paid by small entrepreneurs as a personal income tax - a compensation structure to increase costs by increasing prices, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and the national increase in trade taxes will probably continue next year, the total tax revenue from sales to both state and local governments will increase compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014 to 6,2 %.
Washington can, however, be held for others because the reduction in state expenditure is taking its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putinovo Novorusko and Lafatova scissors
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorusku
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government forces with the pro-survey rebels have been meeting since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-circumvention sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided by the West to the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine, according to him, contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict according to him depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Another sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic has made the right to disagree with parts
The European Commission, together with diplomats, has decided, within a week, to propose a further endorsement of the anti-corruption sanctions at night for the EU summit.
The reporters told this to the Permanent Chairman of the Member States' meetings Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals are to be prepared to move the form of sanctions on Monday.

Unfulfilled promises.
The elections are coming and the parties offer again the impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and rope above Prague.
This is repeated before each choice: the parties promise impossible.
Also now, with the approaching municipal policy choices, politicians are pushing forward who prefers the voters more.

Joan Rivers’ family: “We are holding our fingers.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since they brought her to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today expressed her hope that she wouldn't lose one-year-old coma to heal.
\"Thank you for your greetings and support,\" said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call for a rescue service, according to which she had a heart attack on the York Endoscope in Upper East Side, as reported by the source.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of sedation and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition, which remains “serious. ”
Responses did not allow themselves to wait long, including unrealistic Internet support from personality such as Donald Trump, Montell Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is a twisted title
There is no news about the media with their headlines.
I know that the headlines are selling, but unfortunately, I also know that many so-called “readmen” are not reading anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been very concerned about lately, more importantly, it's a word of anger.
This is particularly the case with articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
The title “Izrael attacked Gaza” is quite common.
Only in the text, you will find that Israel’s attack was a reaction to the fired rockets from Gaza, often at the time of the stated measure.
This will then appear the headlines - Your parties have broken the measure -
Does the journalistic community realize that they are directly involved in anti-Semite attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't passed 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, the people who survived Shaa live.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the heads of the Jewish pig - and the like of confidence, I got stuck.
Is this what the world wants to finish what didn't work out for Hitler?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews they were intended to destroy the Soldeds?
Ladies and gentlemen of journalists, please give a little more care for your work.
You are often referred to as “seeing the dogs of democracy”
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend also the right of one truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to act if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation would destroy and delete the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, almost 20% of Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between us, like Gaza, they'll answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top health care (I saw Arabs normally go to the top private hospital of Hadassa, which is financed from the Jewish sponsor's gifts from all over the world, and is clearly treated there).
Hamas is attacking their Arab brothers.
The only real help for Gaza, and the rest of this restless area, is to get rid of Hamas and arm him.
And not to judge Israel, to be indirectly in the headlines.
Inform Hamas about his abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is intended to destroy Israel at any cost.
Even at the price of death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.
Please note that in nine years of Gaza, this area could have been acquitted by humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, which, however, does not apply to Gaza's administrators, and they are even angry that they are sometimes interrupted by current supplies at this time.
If Hamas didn't invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide attacks on the territory of Israel, but for example in building housing houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the statement from Monday morning: Internet retailers - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys $1.04 billion (97 million US dollars) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement caused a surprise, not because no one would expect Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, Twitche Googl looked certain for one billion, and this connection looked natural.
Twitch, who had just started Justin.tv three years ago, had been caught to become a commonly used video streaming service - a live YouTube version.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transfers from the game - the words Business Insider “YouTube for live played game”
Twitch Interaface.
On YouTube there are already popular videos of “Let's play - a kind where mudrlanti (most older) give games of processing Mystery Science Theatre.
The fact is that YouTube is coming to an overcast, so the news that YouTube is buying now doesn't get too excited about anyone was a textbook example of how the company introduced will pay off the possible competition.
The idea is why the YouTube agreement didn't come out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Everything we currently have is the expression of CEO Twitche Emmet Shear: “We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our company, have the same values and long-term vision, and want to help us fulfill it more quickly.
Another mystery is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitche.
For snobby like me, who claim that sport is better than watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, games instead of real playing just watching.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder at 3:00 a.m., and there's another thing to watch someone else watch him hit 20 in the head of Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are players from a perspective, so looking at their records without being able to control themselves is a pretty good recipe to get a headache.
I admit that games of type speeded run, in which Rogers Bannisteers will finish our electronic time in record time, is fun.
But if someone's not a master of playing or humor, his Twitchi channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do they know about the petition like me?
Twitch has a monthly visit of 55 million and is fourth at the top of the Internet operation.
How exactly will Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch's involved in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it might have been to swallow YouTube.
Twitch, however, has something that every company would like to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, “they believe in the future of the game - and the media do not seem to be maiming, nor like - a swallowing - audience.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time, on the theme of the Holy Scriptures are God’s Word -
Added original video.
The second basic lie of creativity is belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of many things contrary to their religion, they often raise us before the question: Who will you believe?
The given word of God, or the word of man?
As if human examination was completely insignificant compared to the authority they believe to have their doctrine.
But when they say “man,” they speak of science.
And when they refer to “the word of God, ” they refer to the myths of the written people.
If there really is an intelligent one with a creator with a purpose, then it is him who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be him who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be him who added another series of evidence that points exclusively to the revolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't have created any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fake stories.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that predominate that they were the word of God.
Every allegedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written people, not gods.
People who have been “inspirated, or inspired, by their favorite gods, or by listening to the dictatorship of angels, but those texts have not been written down by anyone other than simply mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not by angels and no more gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religion, the über-galactic supergénis, the street entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of such size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, only holy letter.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because people's authors would not be able to measure themselves with such works.
And people wouldn't have to listen to her because she would be consistent, based on testimonial and true evidence, showing deep morality and wisdom beyond all human limits.
It would continue to inspire every reader to one another’s faith.
If she was written to God, we wouldn't have expected anything smaller.
But what we see instead is the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without shared origin, and they all are constantly diverging into more and more separate denominations, seeking the truths and each one in some way claims God’s guidance, regardless of the continuing dissatisfaction and separation in every direction.
Jewish Torah, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lllah Kitab-i-Addas, Zarathuštrov Avesty, Sikhian Adi-Granth, Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormonova, or Urantia's book are all considered to be “absolute truth,” and“the word of the one true god, and the respective believers of each of them say that the rest of them are in compassion.
The only logical explanation is that all of them are on a certain scale.
None of the above books have any advantage against others.
None of them have any evidence resistance, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apathy, because they contain irregularities, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them argue that they were confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - that each of them may contain prophecy that was not fulfilled.
The chief theologians point out that all the sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and thus are subject to interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a countermeasure, rather mutual comments.
We must once again point out that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editor review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author and he's definitely not a witness to tell!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five books of the ‘Moses’, and Moses does not assign authority to any of them, because almost certainly it did not exist as it is described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several interrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents have been refiltrated in the same time and all are assigned to human authors.
The Bible is not even as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their infinite foundation of all Western monotheistic faith, yet many centuries younger than the roots of zooastroism, Buddhism, Hinduism, helénism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic belief, followed the doctrines and the ebionites and their completely different views on Jesus, which eventually combined in some compromise called orthodoxie.
Other Christian groups like lucipherians were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these adjustments relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to young mighty religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock Ba'al Zebula, “The Lord on the Mount,” changed to Belzebub,“The Lord of Much.
So the Bible was deliberately and unlawfully amended both for religious or political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of committee decisions on the snow in Nicoji.
Four Gospels were accepted and 16 others were rejected by simple lifting of hand, as if the fact of some things could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon evolved depends on what was read about Sundays in these Christian centers.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church in the same time?
And they gradually found out that they were coming closer to the same evangelical stories.
Thus, the core of the canon evolved this way from the kidnapping of the first church.
So he simply accepted as an evangelium any relevant stories that collided between unginned masses in that time.
But they also consciously took more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to books that were approved.
We will find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets between the rejected items.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are just words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God was the true author of this enthusiast of reputation, parables, and a stomach lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written to people and certainly not too enlightening, rather on the contrary!
That's why there's so much of her historical and scientific content entirely wrong, whatever it's about almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, brushed objects, fire medicine, astrology and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to shoot someone's blood, it'd cure him from the top.
We're talking about the people who thought the rabbits were chewers and bats are birds and whales are fish and drinking that they're all numbered.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant cows to pierced patterns, they would give birth to a pruned telat.
How could anyone say that about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible had been written up by some higher beings, then it would not contain the error it contains.
If she came from a pen really superior being and was intended as literal history, then she wouldn't have any of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it is totally failing because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by unbundling and bigothing savages who overseeed or supported the cruelness of animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence on children, abortions, falsification, murder, cannibalism, genotype and prejudice to race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by saying that they are doing God’s will.
But creativeists keep ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the Creaciists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't even have God.
There's one thing in their world and the other is the same.
The irony is that they reject God’s - share - as “the worship of creation instead of the Creator -
But they consider the word of God and God to be the word of God alone and even insist that their alleged “sacred ones” are the books of God as such.
Not their version of God but all the versions of God.
Creatical Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God lies.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship a man-made compilation, like if these books were God himself, because they think they're JEHO's word.
But God never wrote nor dictated any of the writings of any religion.
All people who have approved or refused to their alleged “changeable words” - any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, and frequently changed and recircled by only missing people.

Apple iCloud reportedly told the hackers, they got naked images of celebrit to the public
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
So far an anonymous user on the server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, pointed out that American Mashable.com server.
The data received an incorrect access to the user accounts on the Applu servers, where the affected users recorded them by automatic backup of the images from the iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't addressed the problem yet.
Part of the celebrit rejects the images as faked, but has already acknowledged several of the trueness of the images concerned.
They include the actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for the title role of Katniss in the Hungarian Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the death trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the pictures and videos to enrich.
The footage was reported to be interested in American magazines, according to reports on the server 4chan, but the hacker wants better money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it's probably a weakness in iCloud's security.
At GitHub server two days ago, there was a tool that allowed you to get the password to user accounts through the rough force, i.e. automatic repetition of attempts to register with different passwords.
This tool was clearly working, but Apple closed the safety hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this instrument.
Therefore, iCloudu users should change their Apple ID password for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The escape of naked images of celebrit shall be considered as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured multiple times better than computers in households or smaller companies, the addition of sensitive photos in an unprotected form of unnecessary risk is a charge.
If you want online backup of express photos or any other sensitive content, first encrypt files before upload.
It is also understandable to set automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it can only run on the wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will be able to move sensitive images in time to safety - and especially you will have space to delete unscheduled images, so they will not be unnecessary to store space in an online storage site.
The instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of electronic books from Michal Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
Smart way to save for college script
Given that the award for a university script for many students exceeds 1,000 dollars a year, the upcoming student of the second year came in a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a book lending system from classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to keep them from selling back.
“The book on the calculations that normally costs 180 dollars, I received for the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studied at the Copenhagen College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university board, an average student spends more than $1,200 a year in textbooks and aids, but students have different possibilities to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is becoming online shops and creative solutions such as Schroederovo.
On the rise is lending textbooks, which allows students to use a semester book often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc operating more than 250 bookshops in campus sites says lending has doubled since 2011.
The survey in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in the university bookshops were borrowed in the previous spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbook texts are purchased by the National Association of University Businesses.
Here are 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be lower on the Internet than in the university bookshop.
The recommended award for the 9th edition of the book “Calculus - Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new $239.99 in a small shop specialized in the textbook.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other people or wear and indigestion, the appropriate options are used by textbook texts.
At Chegg.com, “Calculus is selling for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, student of the upper year at Brigham Young University, says that he paid for the used copy “Strategic Media Councils: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business - 42 cents.
New man was selling $48.
The university teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students in their teachers check whether the older issues are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no changes to work in seminars significant.
If so, older editions may be sold at a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are the favorite alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Renting
It is also worth renting textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and do not need them after the seminar is completed.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the whole semester.
Meet the terms of the trade in which you borrow your book, including the impact on notes, clarifications or wear and damage.
Remember: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to provide instead of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books basically borrow electronic license valid for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends “Calculus, for six months in approximately 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most suitable offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to stores.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends to follow up according to ISBN because it guarantees you're buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gault.
He was convinced of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookshop.
Bahna, it's the mud.
And then they found a rifle in the well from the end of the war
This well stands a short distance from St. George's church.
We've discovered the growth around and we've started to pull out an airship - about a mile and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we approached the clay bottom, we ran into the head,” Radomil Novák flew.
We pulled her out, cleaned her up, and found out she was a tortoise German rifle used by SS units.
It's supposed to be unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand, added Novak.
All the wooden construction things have broken down in time, so it's not useful.
But her body is preserved - keeping its shape.
How did it get in the well?
One explanation exists.
Maybe there were people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably in fear of not being pushed away.
The Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do it.
They threw guns in the woods, thinking of a finder.
The box was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Duha Jesenians found in the well.
“There may have been hand grenades, but there were many of them there once, so we slowed down the excavation work, and we carefully deepened the mud so that there would be no calamity, but there was nothing else down there,” Novak approached.
The find ends in the museum depository at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudolfice.
Ukrainian General: I haven't saved Czech Republic yet
An exclusive conversation Current.cz with the general member of Volodymyr Ruban, which frees Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the Proserian separatists.
Kyiv/Praha - - I must take this... call from Donock, - apologized eight times in an exclusive conversation with the Update.cz Ukrainian general general Volodymyr Ruban, or the director of that Centre for the liberation of war prisoners.
General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
At any such interruption, it was not possible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they were - or should be - that Ruban specified with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
“It will be - go there,” he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donock and again dedicated to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the bay, somewhere else a jet pilot and an active participant in anti-governmental protests in Majdan.
Just yesterday - when we talked about it, he was in Donek.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the Proserian separatists is devoted to 40 hours a day.
At present.cz: You may know that Czechs are fighting on the side of the Ukrainian separatists.
Our counter-crime estimates their number by thirty.
There may be many more of them, of course.
Have you met any Czech prisoners during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already delivered captured Serbia, Dagestance, Chechnya, one Swedes, Georgia... but Czech Republic not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we ran into your captured countryman and could set him free.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the Ukrainian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they are fighting in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists, they will be taken away from them after an interrogation without mercy, they will shoot them as well as any other stranger.
The Separatists consider these men as rent mercenaries, and they think nothing deserves anything but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Domen's separatists - and between them also Czechs - they will put him behind bars and treat him as with war prisoners.
This guy will just survive.
The Ukrainian party is also acting as a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many have you managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand correctly, they'll trade.
Some sources point out that it's already crossed a hundred men.
We've stopped counting on how many people we've helped.
But we just set them free... we didn't save them from the war if they decide to keep fighting.
The saviors are doctors, surgeons in war, but we're not.
That's it.
And there's more and more every day.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another, a four or five.
And it doesn't have to always be about exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: It hears that in a few months you have gained great authority and even confidence in the Prosquest separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both war parties?
Hard question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me a nickname - crazy general with steel balls -
It doesn't hurt me.
And maybe that's the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Disciplinary Corps, I've acquired some authority before.
I never get out, I don't cheat, and I keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm acting honestly, and I'm telling the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government, or the Danish or Luhanian very uncomfortable.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're torturing them and killing them.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I was replaced by prisoners, and... this job could ever mean the end to me... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures do you know about?
... (long silence)... to torture prisoners, the Ukrainians and separatists are deranged in the hearings.
I'm sorry.
And executions?
They're only playing the Donese side.
I have no information about the Ukrainian army as well.
Not even a sign that the Ukrainian army has committed something like this.
We have an idea about the amount of execution, but I can't do the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Notify me of the characters and motifs of the Proru separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to be alone and maybe even democracy in Donek or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their immemorable opponents - for life and for death.
As we say, they went over their throat.
The same dreams and desires were made clear by the way in Majdan.
And now I'm a little behind: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be a big one, and the other is a small one.
This is my sentence, but there's an impenetrable resistance in it.
A.cz: How do you, for example, seem to be one of the toughest leaders of the proparatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the lines of war fronts, I'm free of weapons, and I show soldiers or armed men with their bare hands.
And they always have me on both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the shell or in the optical angler.
The faces of the people who are targeting me, every time I see them well... and they can pull the trigger of their guns at any time.
A superintendent, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family, his mother, lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine should not exist.
And if you do, just like a little governor in a great Russian empire.
In any case, he constantly talks about it, and Ukraine considers it a misunderstanding.
This state should not even exist, according to him.
At the same time, he is an impossible enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we are talking about character - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you are your Prime Minister Arseni Jaceňuk, who referred to as weak, helpless and tired - leader, who would do the best if he left quickly.
After those three hundred meters of walk, I'll always get at least five times scared.
So why should I hide with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that it harms our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Jaceňuk are calling the ‘creats’ -
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians, from which he would be afraid or should be with other respects and authority.
His behavior is directly copying the king's behavior.
He may be a good economy, but as Prime Minister, he does not have the right to cry in the war, beg him to play with him his intrigues, threaten to pose a function... he must govern the country, manage it, and protect it at the time of war.
At the risk of the country, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on crying emotions.
He's the first Minister of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
He's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's always complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians couldn't save the market
Postradable 3 Sylvester Stallone returned from the 1990s' budget in the United States less than 30 million dollars and Sin City: A woman I would only return from the 1970s million budget.
Film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $ 14.6 million during the first weekend and also films for children like How to train dragon 2 were for cinema disappointment.
According to the article on Robbie Collin's film critic in Telegraph, it is for children's films to blame their own quality.
Collin referred to 2014 as “the worst year of children’s films, and how to train dragon 2 he called only “functional” the continuation.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the film itself.
In July, the Entertainment Weeky servers CinemaScore and Metacritic compared their average rating of summer film premieres in at least 2,000 cinemas during the period between the day of the victims of war and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of viewers and film critics indicate that this year's film crop is similar to the quality of last year's hits.
According to some commentators, changes in viewer access and higher popularity of Internet servers like Netflix can be found on the guilt.
The director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney processing Books jungles, the Hollywood Reporter’s website, said: “I think times are changing, ”
We have to admit it and don't try to chase over what's been done.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood cash markets, Netflix has profited from the Internet services of 1.2 billion dollars, which is almost twice as much as $837 million last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studies for relying too much on comic books rights and foretold “the collapse of Hollywood.
In view of the current fall, some commentators claim that there may be something at its catastrophic well-being.
With possible large cash markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Pimoňów and the Jurské world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
A producer of X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decline in sales as simply “cycical” - for Hollywood Reporter said: “The summer of the summer will be the biggest cash marketplacers in history and no one will worry about selling.
KDR is risking Soul again; it has set off another short-circuit rocket.
North Korea launched another short-circuit rocket to the sea, announced Soul.
The specific rocket test took place shortly after the completion of the U.S. military common maneuvers and South Korea, which Pyongjang perceives as preparation for invasion.
The Čagang Province lies in the Northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
South Korean Defense Department spokesperson according to the DPA said the shots were fired from the location in the Northwest of the KDR and reached approximately 200 kilometres away.
North Korea has probably first fired a rocket from the Kagang province, said South Korean media with a appeal to military circles.
In the province, there is an underground firearm for Scud rockets.
It's another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has done in recent weeks.
North Korea has carried out an unusually large amount of rocket and artillery tests this year.
Summit NATO: First protests in Newport and Cardiff

Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, had yours on his leg.
Only 23 years old forvard could decide, but he failed in two greatest chances.
After the goal, she called mainly the shooting near three minutes before the end, but she ended up on Opava Josef Květon's goalkeeper.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself,\" he put your ashes on his head.
I should've put it under the lid, it kind of went off,\" he said.
Defence Sigma did not allow it much, except for Mikul's raid from 11 minutes, but covered by the goalman Reichl.
Then they started pushing the Hanacians, but they didn't leave the building behind, and the shootings from the distance caught the Flower.
We compared ourselves for 15 minutes, then we took over the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the saved chance of yours didn't change, and so it ended at 0:0, - the coach of Hanác Leoš Kalvodu.
Opava bod took also because of the withdrawals in the assembly, where Peter Vavřík and three-gauge shooter Petr Ševčík, who host in Sezsk from Sigma, were also missing in addition to two injured.

The alternates deserve discharge.

Nothing that could satisfy the boss of Josef Lébra's club, who, after defeating Znojm, gave his million deposit to the cash register a diametrically different performance in other matches.
\"We realized Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be said that the boys wouldn't want to fight,\" said Kalvoda and added to the address of the sleeping shooter yours: \"I believe it will come and when he gives the goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first shot, I will shoot him right away to save his goals for the next fights,” Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino's double-checked Venice.
Film Festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After the great enthusiasm of the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu ranked among the serious candidates in the Golden lion, the next days witnessed that he was interested in the 71st year of the festival in Venice.
Whether the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to 14 hundred, or because after Birdman followed criticisms accepted, but for spectators less attractive images as a documentary on the genotype in Indonesia 60 years over silence and other films with social theme from the American 99 homes to Iran, the cinemas were left empty seats.
Fowls of the species Gallus domesticus
Not even a red carpet before the festival palace has yet been treated as such crowds as in the past, and apparently it has stopped being a problem to get a place at the hotel for the last minute.
The crisis in Italy is spoken more than elsewhere, and there is no wonder that it has also been affected by such weighted institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself as a lack of personality, but only in relation to films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of representatives of comic books of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who in 99 homes successfully made dramatic roles, for all generations, the main event of the visit of the legendary actor Ala Pacin has become the main event.
He also lit up here in two movies.
In the story of Prosperation out of the competition that filmed the oscar Barry Levison according to the novel Philip Roth, he has a 40 - year - old Pacino role that is close to him: actors at the top of the glory that suffers from depression from the end of careers and personal life.
But seeing him the second day as the suspect owner of the railway from the rural town in Manglehorn, who filmed David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi Cup for best acting performance should not miss it - but does the artist still need prices?
He may be the greatest satisphatic love of the audience, and especially the Italian one, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud to the ground from which his grandparents come.
Body for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi have become the first image of the long sweats that have been rewarded by Birdman.
The Kalábrian branch of the mob is viewed by the view of family relations between the clans, fighting each other for power and money, and the director managed to align all the assumptions for a good film: quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He was also interested in the chamber psychothhriller Hladová's heart that filmed Savegio Costatzo with Alu Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost his own child.
On the contrary, French competition films did not expect warm acceptance or ransom for fame, nor three hearts, both works that appeal to the traditional model of consumption films that are concerned about the popularity of the actors.
But, after all, two really great films, Birdman and the Black Soul, are not so little at the first half of the festival.
And maybe festival pictures have some depressive stories, a new picture of Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy in Venice outside the competition and filmed in American wedding style for 40 years, managed to lift the mood for more than one day.
Policemen caught four producers of pervitin in Prague, they drove drugs from Poland
“The Detectives held three men in the past days at the age of 42, 42 and 37 years and a five-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug pervitin at Prague 9, from last November until August 9,” said the police spokesperson Jan Rösler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, the cihlářská street intervention unit caught a twenty-fourth organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman who represented in the group as a buyer of drugs in Poland and a dose dealer.
The next day, the detectives held on the basis of the prior consent of the state attorney of another member of the group, the seven-year-old man.
The last of the four policemen took place in the Wednesday morning morning on August 20th in the Maleske Spathouse area,\" she described the spokesperson.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of drugs
The main organizer had a wide field impressive.
In the workshop of the resort, in the garden cottage in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konovov Street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitins, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and provided the transfer of medicines with pseudoephedrin from the Republic of Poland.
In addition, the manufactured drug was weighing, divided into plastic bags and then sold pervitin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs to drug addicts, a 25-year-old woman has yet to be punished.
She received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced,” added Rössler.
Criminists have also carried out several home tours on the basis of the order of the judge, where they have secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringe, hoses and other devices and articles that can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dearer has been punished seven times since 1995
“From the available records, the police found that the principal organizer was in total seven times convicted for property criminal activity since 1995, the woman was not punished by the court,” the police spokesperson said.
In 2006, he was conditionally convicted for the offence of sexual abuse and a seven - year - old automechanist, who was prosecuted for freedom, has been convicted nine times since 2009.
Even in him, it was mostly for property criminal activity.
The investigator accused three men and a woman from committing a criminal act of illegal production and other handling with tangible and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threatens them to have up to a decade of prison.
In the case of three persons, he finally filed an investigator to the state representative and called for a proposal to establish ties to which the judge finally placed them,” the spokesperson said.
Fourth accused, seven-year-old recidivisist, ended free.
His position and role in this case were not so fundamental as to the other accused.
The policemen continue to work with this man.

The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disturbing gymnasium and high school doesn't make any sense.
In addition, the Czech Republic has little generally educated people and statistics show that the gymnazists have good applications.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In schools in the last 14 days, major preparations have been made.
Usually, it's routine business, like transfering florists from the summer storage site back to the classroom, and faxing the chalk.
They're gonna have a little bit more frmol on the magnesium gymnasium.
A few days before the beginning of the season, the furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature are installed in the library.
There was no robbery or disbelief, four-year-old gymnasium in Hořice after three years opening and renewing its business.
Not public, but private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of a school to be confirmed by the entry into the registration of a school managed by the MŠMT.
‘The French Socialists should shut down and put France in order,’ says the key ally Francoise Holland
Valls calls for a heavily fragmented left to “show her support - to a wary socialist president whose new division of functions did not happen with the approval of most Frenchmen.
The President deserves general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
“Our duty is to stay by his side,” he said and calmed down the applause.
As a mixed gesture, the Prime Minister held that his government would not question the controversial French 30 - hour working week despite his passionate arguments by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Finance, who proposed that the rules should be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain “consistent,” with the government.
Christian Taumir, the Minister of Justice, but did a line over the budget when she appeared at the meeting of the rebel Socialist Members, where the Socialist Party criticized for her “the French have lost faith in the future ”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of extremely conservative right, with constant internal disputes between socialists laughing when she declared that she did not assume that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls has also been forced to set up a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
\"And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter,\" Le Pen said to his supporters.
It repeated its call for Parliament to be dissolved and stated that it was convinced that this party could win early elections and that it was ready to drive the country.
The French Government suffered defeat in March's municipal elections and, in May, extremely conservative right succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public opinion survey of the Journal du Dimanche week, 76 percent of the French think that the Socialist Party is risking to split into several competing factions before the end of Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, Politologist of Sciences Po University, warned that the French will soon be patient if the new socialist government does not improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes occur in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Hasard and street art Prague no longer restricted to the election
The changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved to the new leadership of the capital.
From the streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal choices of another casino and the city will not restrict street art.
There won't be a dog walking limit.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes in the relevant decrees in October.
In addition, the decision on changes should not be taken by the current management of the city, which will end in a few weeks of mandate, said Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling in their territory.
Herny's not going to disappear, but she's not going to change about gambling yet.
It's a task of a new management of the city after the elections.
We would now not have made it technically, given, for example, the time limits for submission of comments and the same,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, which had to change the decrees, would take place on September 11th.
The referendum on the full ban on gambling is on the day of municipal elections of the city part Prague 1 and Praha 8.
At present there is a ban on gambling, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the search will not change even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal for a place to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also want Prague 5 around Angel.
The search governing the walking of dogs of the city is about to take a few months, so far it is not finished.
The location of the heren and the issue of busking solves the city's decrees.
It can issue or edit only the representative of the capital.
The town halls only have an advisory voice, they can't give their own decrees.
Last week, he had a victory against the Scottish independence of his hand.
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger that this mistake would make for the third time when she almost placed on billboards all over Scotland the question of whether they wanted Scotland to be rich.
But you won't get to the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor will you get their respect if you start threatening them.
The New Testament Moral is still alive in Scotland, although few Scottish still go to church today.
The cattle have much more tendencies to get the exchangers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and that is why he repeatedly asked his opponent, Unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect the “suverenary will of the Scottish people” - if Scottish voters vote for independence, and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
That made Darling go between the Scottish civil society and London's finances, and he fell into this trap with grimata.
Of course Darling won't support the Scottish voters' mandate.
However, this discussion about Scotland’s currency was more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defense of state health that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London's banker in the currency matter, and he also felt that he would not protest against privatization of health.
As Salmond said, “he went into bed with conservatives.
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voters know that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This is confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the association of the \"Boss\" - to the Confederation of the British industry.
It is clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with the Scottish Prime Minister Hammond was a serious mistake for the Union's campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly household withdrawal.
He'd be respected by the Scottish Prime Minister if he came to the debate.
Cameron could at least say Scotland could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: the Scottish are not supposed to jump and they have to accept what is.
The last year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Miloš Urbana
Acquisitions to the story The longest year
Miloš Urban Latest Year
The end of the vacation was the best, the last week that went nowhere, and we were just fighting and crying with the baby summer, the silence before the storm, the peace before stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading fast arrows, already fallen, running around Imperial to the back of the Vara, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer warm, the sun starved the back and shoulders, knocked the rays on the ground.
In the evening, a mild nervousness, still a vacation regime, sleep up to half eleven o'clock, in a week it'll be worse, moments before they fall asleep from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at 6:30 in the morning.
He'll be here Monday.
Most of the time it doesn't start, on the contrary, this summer is misplaced in front of school.
To sneak in in a pap and feel like a plastic figure in glass mining, there's the school, the ZDŠ A.
And before her, the old familiar faces and the new, the boys pulled out, the girls more breast-feeding.
There are glands, avoid them, as well as interesting as keeping them together, and how soon they are here.
And these grown-up girls who came screaming now laughing hysterically, probably in their lives over the holidays, and everything's in my old place.
And again, new first-timers, some nervous, and others excited, why are they even coming here?
Because he must, the educational union has to.
So inside, the cool humidity of the floor and the light smell of the disinfectant, poisoned by a schoolgirl with a mop, unfortunately still the same thing that will lend the student the key from the canopy box, where they can leave the textbooks and which are still so little.
To the bottle.
The smell of the wardrobe remains in memory, now it's not done, it's well-exploited, but it's gonna get worse in a week.
It's just the idea that the stomach's on, and it's starting to hurt.
A head that gets even worse from math, the devil's play for the chosen ones that I don't belong to and never will be.
Again, these threes and fours, don't go fives, hide from the test, fall into the bench, and best to be there, not be there, there exists only as a name in the classroom and dream stories of nicer girls and nicer buildings, on antennas to space, where no one with any burdens, no one reduces and harms anyone's leg.
The last year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She let her daughter die.
She's threatened by a special punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without a foreign help, a girl was born, who was wrapped in the blankets after the spraying, hiding under the bundo and taking her to the road guide, where she put her in the bushes of several ten meters from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school
It seemed a little early to me.
I was on my way to school.
I had a need to go to the bathroom on the bus, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the pantry with the scissors I used to wear to school,\" she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
“The body of the child entered the backpack and drove the body out of the backpack, wrapped in the black igelite bag and hid and left it under the stairwell of her grandmother’s house in Havlíčkov Broda,” she says in the action that it is not quite obvious when a newborn was killed.
It could have been ten minutes, but even a few hours after delivery, squeezing during the blanket cover or inserting under the jacket, cooling or bleeding from an unintended canopy.
The same scenario was repeated in spring next year.
A woman found random witnesses under a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk from February to April 12, when a child was found in an unprotected period of time from February to April 12.
This time in the bathroom under the apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether it was born alive without cutting over and tying up a canister who was surrounded around her neck, she put a child in several plastic containers, including plastic bags, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and the next partner took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave it to her.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about pregnancy.
And for that reason, he is not now in court, but he has been punished for the sin against the law on burial.
It was also him who later turned to the police.
I don't like the fact that he's not punished as a co-worker.
He manipulated a child against my wish.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it came to me like a human being,\" she didn't hide the apparition of the defendant that allegedly followed and was afraid of him.
During her statement, a young woman spoke relatively well.
The elephants led her to the moment she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching her full - life.
She said she didn't want to kill.
“They follow me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she went up.
I didn't get my equipment because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I wanted to put him in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you,” she answered the judge's question.
However, she refused to act with thought and intention of killing her newborn.
In addition, the second child was born dead according to her claim.
But she didn't stop drinking alcohol when she was pregnant.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also limited smoking,” she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, all of them claimed that she had health problems that she was initiated.
And this is my friend.
The main bid will continue with the castle court on Tuesday with the statements of judicial experts.
On Wednesday, a judgment could already be made.
A woman is threatened by a criminal rate of up to 18 years of prison, or by an exceptional penalty.

Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong on the day following the voting decision have provoked Chinese authorities
Near there were groups of loyal to Beijing who had Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of three candidates participate in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain support for the appointing commission, which is likely to be made up of faithful Beijing members.
Due to this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get to election tickets and to bring pro-democratic activists back their vows and protect Hong Kong financial center of protests by moving “Occupation of Central”
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, the Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on Chinese official power in Hong Kong, democratic activists organised an informal referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered the city business district and occupied it.
The press conference held by Prime Minister Li will be organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day several press conferences were also to speak to the Vice-President of the Standing Committee on the Legal Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council for Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
The student activists said that the afternoon would meet before Hong Kong's office.
In recent days, the colonial government of 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
According to the description of the events of the Russian newspapers, President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop the fight against separatists in the east of the country on Sunday, and immediately began negotiations on “state sovereignty, outermost areas.
His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to indicate that the eastern Ukraine region under the control of separatists will become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian speaking area should have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to act with the Prorusky rebels as being equal is consistent with the obvious strategy that follows from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant a newly declared Novorusku a real independence so that the place with the West can connect with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of State TV Putin condemned Ukrainian military events to regain the eastern area of Donock and Luhansk, which in March and April were controlled by separatisté after Moscow on 18 March, the Crimean peninsula, which belonged to Ukraine.
Kremlin and separatists have recently referred to the recently occupied territory as “Novorusia, or “New Russia, a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian Press Agency Itar-Tass published Putin’s words, according to which “the prison of illusions,” everyone who believes that there are peace negotiations on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign before the parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government troops attack civilian populations in the areas of separatists.
\"In the interests of people living in these areas, we must start meaningful negotiations without delay, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of the society and on the Statute of the state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine,\" he said.
Peskov said that Putin's exposure to state sovereignty has been thought in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been dealing with Kyev's leadership for several months and which is about to mitigate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy could only be granted to the Ukrainian government in the eastern area.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about the internal Ukrainian conflict -
The progress of the spokesperson Kremlin, which was meant to correct “the wrong interpretation of the Putin notes, highlighted the approach of Russia’s leadership to the solution of separatists in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million populations are originating in ethnic Russia.
Moscow should also have a much greater difficulty in anticipating Donock and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls of public opinion, which have been before the conflict, have shown wide support for the continuation of Ukraine.
The autonomy of Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially to give Kremla a real control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula declared five months ago is the seat of the main Russian fleet, the maritime and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the centre of the mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President Petro Porosenko, during his inaugural speech of 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give more control to the various regions of their finances and their language statutes.
However, this vision of autonomy differs considerably from the vision of Kreml and separatists. Moscow is accused of armament and inciting violence.
Putin's last call for Kyev to act as separatists to follow the next process of rebels last week after Russian units and tanks from a former peaceful area along the Azov Sea penetrated the eastern Ukraine.
The Separatists of Russia took control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a campaign to set up strategic coastal areas up to Crimea.
This has improved the enormous civil and military effort to open Mariupol, the port with metalurgic combinations of 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, the jury set out a meeting of the European Union’s leading representatives in Brussels and invited action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return, ” warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecific escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, on Saturday, reporters in Kiev said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after last week two colonies of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated into the Doněcky region to support the dressed separatists.
The first of the 63 declared Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovajsk in Russia during the Russian invasion was replaced on Sunday for 10 Russian supporters captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, said Lysenko on Sunday.
In a scandal with exposed photos, Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his neglect over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and other powerful Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the largest scandal with hacked photos of celebrity got a series of outstanding photos on the Internet, naked Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims he has 60 photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delvingne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the escape from iCloud, personal images of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melburg actresses Greckko were reported to the public.
There's 101 celebrit on the list.
Edelsten, which Grecko asked for his hand last month, said: “It’s disgusting.
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greek, now in New York, reports that the hack is “unstable, ” and those who have become its target,“ they have been humiliated. ”
It's considered that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with a former friend of Scott Speedman, including two images, on which he's up there without a swimming pool.
For example, Palmer was active in Love and Honor, where her counterpart Liam Hemsworth was.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series and actress from the thriller Fucker Punk Browning yesterday, they didn't comment on the pictures.
Deputy Lawrence TMS said: “There is a clear breach of privacy,
Actor Seth Rogen hacker criticized his twitter: “Trust photos from hack phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.
Legally, disclosure of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma's footballers have won the Lébra, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunders and lightning, which co-owner of the Olomoąc Sigma Josef Lébr sent on his subordinate last week, are, appear, past.
At the end of the day, they only brought a point for the defenseless draw.
The club bosses were just a little bit good by establishing and fighting.
Money to pay for the club could soon come to the club.
“I don’t have one more game, as I talked about it last week, but I’m far more optimistic,” Lebra confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma did not win, its players convinced its superior performance.
The battle and commitment we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from players.
In that case, I am able to forgive myself for not winning.
If we've played this since the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost yet,\" he thinks Lébra.
The signal in Opava stopped the initial pressure of domestics, then the game was balanced, and in the second half it was better.
After the victory of Kalvoda's trustees touched, but they didn't make it to the goal, so they couldn't win.
Although the result is not according to our imagination.
However, we lacked our full satisfaction but only one variable chance,” said Lebra, who does not think that the change in the approach of footballers caused only his threats.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether on my side, on the side of the coach or fans, he said to Lébr.
With pressure, Sigma has to count
Players didn't want to comment much after the game in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to admit it,” Michael Reichl, the young goalkeeper said.
He completely left a question about Lébrova’s statement last week, Václav Vasek, who did not change the biggest opportunity of Sigma’s Saturday game.
But he just talked a little bit about pressure.
We'll always be under pressure.
Everyone wants to get on us.
Today we have shown that if we fight and all ride ass, it will go,” he said.
Warnings took to heart
Even the coach Leoš Kalvoda did not pretend that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that was in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lébra's warning took it to heart.
Even though it was not even before that they would not want to fight and blow it off, he had an olamous coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a long time to deal with our hardness and realize what the other league was about.
That this is not just about football, but mainly about the fighting,” Kalvoda said.
There's nothing left to hope that Sigma will work from the start in the next fights.
\"I would like to believe in this,\" he added.
