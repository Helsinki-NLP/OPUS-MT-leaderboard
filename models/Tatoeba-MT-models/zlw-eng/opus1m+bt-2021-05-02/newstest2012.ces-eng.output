Parliament did not support the amendment for the liberation of Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the proposal to repeal a paragraph on the basis of which the leader of the opposition to Julius Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendments that would open the way for the release of the prisoner ex-premises were rejected by the Members at the second reading of the proposal to mitigate the penalties for economic delicacies.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly inappropriate agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the condemned is to be discussed by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the sentence as a political bridge of the regime, suspected of the inquisition of the court caused a trial even in the West.
The proposal that paragraph 365 should be removed from criminal law, on the basis of which the ex-premistant was sentenced, be supported in the vote of 147 Members.
226 votes were required for his approval.
Libya’s victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kadáfi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
The winner remains to be defined.
As usual in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but it is whether they are dying or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the Sharia customary law and we have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because his hand is being stolen.
Women can forget about emancipation, any wastes from faith await executions and so on.
Instead of being a dictator, a company consisting of competing tribes will unite the Koran.
In Libya, there will be a order we can't imagine and which we wouldn't want.
But our way of life isn't even the only, even objectively best, and we probably wouldn't have fit for a change, perhaps the Libyians mentioned above.
In fact, it's strange that Islamic warriors have taken the engagement with the unbelievable dogs.
The excuse is that from their point of view, NATO has not guided some generals from America, but Alah, whose size was celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when they are looking for winners in Libya, the West does not belong to them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of political allies in the person of the dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After the fresh bad experience of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy military goods.
Thus, the problem with extortion of “chillers” is different from the fall of the local region.
But they're gonna have no oil company occupation for a little Lebanese black gold?
They may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of the unholy protection of human rights.
Unless you're told by the chauffeurs of the Sharia law.
The new era of the crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe came to the search for investors
The statistical stink went over Europe on Tuesday.
Individuals published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has grown internationally, Germany and France grow.
A long-term market, but today it's breaking records.
Investors no longer look at Italy, but Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published the preliminary estimates of the economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also modified the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (up by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France said that it appeared in a slight decline by 0.1% (the origin data spoke about stagnation).
The Czech economy in this year's third quarter increased by 1.5 percent year.
Meanwhile, however, the gross domestic product (HDP) has stopped and according to the ČSÚ confirmed the trend of gradual slowing down growth in economic performance.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
Most important events:
The Czech economy in this year's third quarter grew by 1.5 percent year, but has stopped for a period of four years.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to the preliminary and seasonal overcalculated data, increased by 0.5 percent.
The euro area economy and the European Union increased by 0,2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has declined by 5.2 percent in the year.
It's 28.45% off her ten-year-old bonds.
The profits of Italian and Spanish bonds are increasing to the critical frontier.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The revenue for Czech 10-year bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is getting worse.
From Germany, the votes are that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs have qualified themselves to the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and celebrates the procedure for 200 million
Football representation of the hardest task of the season has been done!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Petr Jíška won 1-0.
The Czech football also with great luck in the second half of the season has opened a luxurious head start from home recovery and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progress play in the detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of luck in the other one.
The Czech representation also thanks to the home of the dead in the end, to the great Bohemia and hero Jišákk won at Montenegro happy 1:0 and celebrates the process at the European Championship.
The Blacksmiths reached pressure up to half the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech cell.
The losers of the match became Damianovich with the Vuvulators who burned two great chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Czech Republic, even next year's Czech representation will not be missed at the European Championship, plus the prize will be approximately CZK 200 million.
A lot of fighting football has been played since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hardly involved in the combination and played mostly around the midnight line.
The pressure of home footballers didn't come in the first half, because the Czech defense pre-crisis rejected long kicks.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a live shield.
Several hundred colleges created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They wish to express their support for the nuclear programme of their countries against the possible attack of Israel.
On Tuesday morning, students prayed and then called for the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of the University of Iran's Isphahan have created a live shield around the Isphahan nuclear technology centre on Tuesday.
They show that they are prepared to defend their countries with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) stated that Iran had apparently ceased to seek a nuclear weapon.
The possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is spoken in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Islamic nuclear facility and then called for America and Israel to die.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to protect Iran’s nuclear programme as much as possible would be, in the light of Israel’s press, beyond the Islamic Centre, the objective of which the uranium is enriched.
Little girl's baby: she doesn't eat and eat food.
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with an excess weight of 9 percent of schoolers and ostriches being 5 percent of children.
Obsequent children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as shown by the current survey.
It shows again how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows and the patterns it is surrounded by.
For example, they appear in the table in the foreign children, half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried fries had more than 19 percent of the circumcision on the day before the research with the name Obesita.
In the fat families, however, there is no habit of sports, which concerns most of the families of today's schoolers - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents will at least find time for active movement once a week.
Study between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of Obezita's action, not a coincidence that supports General Health Insurance and Unilever.
More than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have yet joined the project.
A proper diet and enough movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic rising number of children who are overwhelming or even obesity.
“Only half of the requested ones, for example, stated that she had five times a day in the breakfast-screte-screte-screte-scading mode, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition,” the results of the survey were one.
No breakfast and sleeping night
Experts point out that for healthy development there are also relative details, including regular family breakfast times.
At the same time, only 23 percent of the school family eats in the Czech Republic.
Everyone eats breakfast in most families alone.
And the worst part was to find out that there is no breakfast in the 10th house at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right diet.
The inquiry showed that in families of both children, unhealthy fries are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soda every day (70 percent).
While more than 40 percent of the children asked regularly, their parents had less than a half - 15 percent result.
Set up your diet.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build up their own diets according to their own tastes and their own opinion.
The construction preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal for healthy nutrition.
Among their favorite meals is a lot of flour, meaty and sweet food.
“Alarmating is particularly a great promise of sweet sodas,” states the final report on the survey.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won just above the poultry.
But children practically didn't want lubes, and the low is also a kiss of fish and luncheon dinners.
Remuneration to Health
At the same time, he showed that children are willing to adjust their dietary habits if they get the right information.
In a number of cases, the audit group of participants who completed the questionnaire following the completion of the Obesit awareness lecture was given a significant shift in preferences towards health nutrition principles, as reported in the results of the project.
For example, it was important for sweet sodas where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children also more often checked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet food and yeast.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, claiming to be pros.
In an initial article on how the stylists were taught, I was kind of complaining about the fact that there was a lot in the opening hours.
I didn't know what to follow.
The lectures of the three studios in the field, the dressing of problematic characters and the seminar on how it goes on the ground.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really - wet -
This time, we discussed with Principal Alenka (the only boy in the course) how to dress a woman who has no perfectly proportionate character.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no noises, and someone's got a weight again.
The stylist must know how to optically negative the wide shoulders, extend the neck or add the required curves.
We got tips like Jennifer Lopez's type, i.e. bigger tits and hips, and a narrow belt, a figure to make a nice point, and at the same time a woman does not get too special.
For example, if there is a difference between the belt and the hips such that the skirts or pants do not really fit, then it will be paid to wear at least one such piece for peace.
You won't regret it, because the perfect falling clothes are priceless.
In a peace dress you will feel much better than in the one that keeps moving on to you, wins, leaves in the belt and the like.
The boy's character can afford to wear algae, applications, heights or loading clothes again.
Such information and types of characters are, of course, many, so I'm glad that I have all week long to take all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given my homework, it's all the same.
Each of the courses received a dedicated celebrity to which it is intended to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We need to consider the current appearance, fashion style of the person and type of character.
I will “besieve” by Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know her from Victoria's Secret's campaign.
In my spirit, for me, it is certainly better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who has recently gained a hundred kilos (please, in the question of the crew), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the suits out of magazines or search the Internet and print and work graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will then express our personal style and relation to graphic formation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is important.
The styleist is not only physically dressed, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, for example, cable trends, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenník told us about.
But it's Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, charged with information about the characters' types, put three guests in the field right now.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a good stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So you can wear such a trenchcoat (or if you want to wear it originally trenchcoat) classically through jeans and a shirt like a coat, but you can put it on the bare body, brush the boats and take it as a dress.
Or just win the sleeves or collars, and the whole look looks different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But I have appreciated the following advice: ‘In order to work, you need to know the rules perfectly,
“You can start breaking them,” said James.
So I'm finally clear why we're taking all the lessons we're dealing with, what to do with, why, when we even see something else in fashion magazines of Leckdy.
Don't even talk about shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist has to have a much more variant of clothing prepared than how many are going to take pictures.
So at the fashion story, which will have ten sides (now ten outfits), I must be prepared to build at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo of clothes she looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely different than in fact.
So we need to count on this in the production of an outfit.
That the image and style make wickdy half the success confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a jealous singer, but the image and marketing made her a world old.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylist services is rather cold.
And the familiar faces of his leckdy consider it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look like it is secondary).
And if anyone already lets us create a styling, then we're supposed to count on the fact that it's likely that it's a totally different size than it really is.
Then it doesn't go before googling and finding out if the boulevard wrote about the fact that the celebrity was suffocated/hubble and so on.
Honza and Mario have placed our hearts on Sunday, that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and to be able to put out.
In his work, he primarily communicates with people who dress, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not to be encouraged, to stand up to your opinion.
“When you're ordered by a manager, you're going to go through her wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out her whole closet and tell her, for God's sake, that's terrible”
“Find at least a few things that you commend and recommend what you can wear,” says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything has to contain so-called ‘plastic’ or a bag to the square.
It's the one you're gonna turn around your belt and you've got all the things you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair rollers or blinds, there are also a silicone thread (with it, the stylist will multiply when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clips to which we put on the back of our clothes if it is larger (spendle or other clamps are not allowed, it will cut off the clothing), or the sewing device.
So we don't just listen to each other, but we also practically tried something, and we learned how to put our shoes right.
Even when taking a picture of an atelier, where the surface is even, the irritation could be damaged, let alone out.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch our shoes so they don't get hurt by chance.
So there is really a need for skill.
Mario pleased me when my creation without reservations was commended.
It's not like she's really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend continuation of the course.
I'm getting more and more clear that dealing with professional styling is really not a walk-in with a pink set, so whoever wants to say what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run race across America.
Review
Originally, the carefree ride is turned into a routine morning shift because of a series of superfluous laydic mistakes.
The ambice, however, managed to a large extent, but it's not valid if no one obviously wanted to do anything more.
A new part with subtitle The Run built before issuing high expectations.
He promised that the flight racing series Needd for Speed would move again in a new direction and from playable demonstrations appeared as a game that would not only be a number in the action race genre.
We were also wondering how they would get in a lineup, where the main hero would step out of the car and run on his own.
However, as it is used for the NFS series, many are a little different in the result than we expected.
They are potentially decent arkade races, but the whole thing brings down several unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series for more or less for several years.
So it's actually not even error, but it's more like the expression of some incompetent left of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has certain problems of personal character and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit on the west coast in San Francisco, and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than 50 races.
It follows that each race is going on another track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't even have a moment of feeling that the game would still offer the same.
Some of the environment are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing worldly.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowed mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the race has been secured with some unusual element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you will be involved in a sandy storm, which greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to spoil you.
In addition, there are quite well-founded individual races.
There's only a few types of them, but that's enough.
You try to avoid the required number of rivals (in principle a classic race), then you get the time again (classic fight with footprints) and then there's a duel waiting for you with the only opponent.
It will take time to get involved with the police, which will make all your efforts even further uncomfortable.
The news is passion outside the car.
Rather, it's just such an interactive animation, when Jack mostly runs away from someone, and you have to help him in that way so that you print the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprising that these passions are much less in the game than you would expect ( perhaps perhaps even only three).
However, the result is to benefit the matter, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above mentioned one thus goes to the elements which the game is written up.
The race model goes in the tracks of previous parts.
That means it's definitely no longer anyone in today, but it can't be said that it would be a barrier.
If you're looking for realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more acceptive race of our driving model still fits quite well, even though we could find better in competition.
Then everything's fine.
But the problems are beginning to occur after some time.
Unlike the driving model, there's not much wrong with the collision model.
From the game of this type we don't expect to count on complex distortions and collisions, but when practically before no impact to any object you have the least idea of how your car is going to behave, then it's probably not all right.
Normally, when you cross or mix cars in normal traffic, you can sometimes only lick each other easily, but sometimes your car in wild pirates will end up in an almost identical situation.
Or even a robbery.
Thanks to the restarts system, it doesn't matter very well, but it'll blow you apart.
Restarts are addressed so that if you break or go far outside the track, the game will throw you back on the last catch point on the track.
However, only five are available in each race.
When you've exhausted them, you have to start race again from the beginning.
It is therefore rather such a tool in case something does not work, rather than rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes even the reforms will not help, they will be resolved when the need to learn a given section of the race will be forgotten.
The great failure of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be passed in a specific way, or you don't simply fit into them.
Other times you will meet again at a given place - civil - cars always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly in situations where you see how the two opponents ride in front of you easily, while when you arrive there are cars in such a position that you have to ride or close them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them because it's been calculated - so that the situation is always right in front of your nose.
There's another advantage for the peers.
In all the time, you will encounter a few places where you, again regardless of the time, will always precede the same opponent in the same place.
Most of the time, it's going to hit at the end of the game on a long bridge where you're going in the counterway.
The opponent must obviously get in front of you at any cost.
When he's in front of you, you're going to get a little worse in front of the car, so at first you're going to get a little confused.
We can understand the intention to make the game agrenal and more urgent, but the execution is so obvious that it will surely depress you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, playing fun and places even so much action that sometimes you don't tend to watch where they fly.
And basically, it doesn't matter whether he has a concept with 50 unique lines, putting up races so that boredom doesn't have a chance or anything else.
An unconventional idea is car replacement during races.
You have to be careful about the petrol pumps on the road because you can change the car right there, even though in most cases you're sufficient with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Corporates are suitable for urban areas, strong American boars on equal highways and exotic supersporcies on technical riding, for example, on the rolling mountain roads.
With the main story regime goes hand in hand and fashion challenge, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only the medals, but also the experience points to your profile, which is common to the challenges and the story.
Different items are deleted for higher level drivers: starting cars and background endings for profile.
This is also again connected with Autolog online functions, which inter alia compares your achieved results with other players and provides additional community functions.
One of the other hard to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car, you will reach the subway tunnel (be sure) where you will find it in the dark of the tracks (be sure).
At the tachometer, you close the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (will be) and the metro set will be set in the back and you will not be compromised.
In the editor, probably for a few days it will last us to discuss whether nobody really thought a little bit about making games or whether the authors really think we're such a big jerk.
The technical page of the game is not extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in several cases even great.
It freezes that in some of the more pressing moments, the image decreases, in some cases, quite tragic.
This is especially the case with more participants, when smooth imaging is no longer valid.
The sound page is fine and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to please the widest range of younger audiences, soundtracks from category “every dog of another vs - but it can be assumed that, because of listening to music, the game will probably not be bought.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so much despair.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of NFS in the last few years.
But that's how the game works unsatisfied.
I'm sure it's fun, but prepare for the mistakes to shake you into the eyes with the force of the airport lights.

Ambassador to EU Vicen:
Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
The Treaty of Lisbon has substantially undermined the balance between the various institutions;
- I didn't expect it to be such a tough war -
“It will take five, six years to settle down, calm down, and before all players get used to their new roles,” the Czech Ambassador to the European Union began his lecture at the Faculty of Law at Milena Vicen.
As far as the motto is clear and openly about Europe is concerned, she has already shown in the first part of her lectures, when she has managed to describe individual EU institutions and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could experience a number of lectures from the Law Faculty of the UK.
Vicen also commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye:
“At first there was criticism that it was unexplained that he was a grey official, that he could not perform any role, and I must say that everyone had gone out of breath that the role had been successful”
\"It is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate perfectly with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.\"
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: ‘Who is this European Union? What phone number should I call, i.e. as a major step towards unification and greater quantity of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban the mermaids.
Vicen also focused on the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency marked it a success.
The Czechs discussed the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
At this time, the government marked it as a great negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech Representation in the EU is currently very busy.
It was said by the Ambassador,-fact frmol, that it was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis to be addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is very complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and cost-effective, which sectors will receive the priority that countries will be supported more and less, that is all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also reminded her main slogans in Brussels:
I really don't like ugly shorts, foreign words, a hanger that no one understands.
How does a citizen understand that they really don’t develop curved or round cucumbers, bananas large, or that someone really has to ban our siren.’
He also wants to use the EU environment better and to get more Czechs to European institutions.
Multiple-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have the reputation of Euroskeptics and people who notice the negative rather than positive aspects of things.
In addition, it is sorry for the low representation of Czech Republic in European institutions.
In guilt, according to her, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she raised the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
“Do tell me that when Polák and Majar come to me and the Slovak comes near me, the Frenchman will say next to me: “Hey, what are you meeting there, what your Visegrad Four is again, and they are not very excited about it”
In the future, the Union, according to Vicen, awaits mainly new tough rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
As a very real one, he sees the concept of dual speed, if not the multispeed Europe, rather than the new European Federation -
\"We have countries outside the euro area and countries outside the euro area.\"
“We have a Schengen area, we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation,
First, it was said that only the countries they wanted should cooperate, and those who do not want to be paid for.
“These institutions will be more and it will be strongly two-speed Europe,” Vicen expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in implementing the principles that all issues affect the whole Union, to discuss between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM begins its second century existence
If someone were looking for a word that would be the closest to IBM’s strategy, it would probably be the closest to long term.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very current, yet it has been a hundred years since its establishment.
This long-term basis was founded by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He's already hit a password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password - Think - thus became a copy around which the life of the future giant will develop (and also the name of an internal magazine that started to come out in IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
“For us from IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and grew up for hundreds of years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around herself.
This allowed us to transform technology, business, and society during our first centuries.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve this even more,\" said Samuel J. Palmisano's current director.
Worked system
Watson, in the 1930 ’ s, took care of his employees in the Czech Republic, similar to the business of Bath in IBM, had as one of the first American employees paid a paid vacation, insurance from the employer plus elegant employee uniform and developed a system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
In the same way, IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
Since the beginning, the company has been brilliant in the production of talent - as one of the world's first companies has canceled any discrimination, so she could have chosen.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, head of IBM, will honour the woman - Virginia Rometta next year.
It has been operating in IBM for 30 years, still becoming head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called pits in recent years, on-line frainstorming, of which many future strategies and innovation arise.
No wonder ideas are enough - almost half a million people work in the company.
An institution with a good name
A firm position in the business ensures its strong internal and external image.
“IBM had more the concept of an institution than just a technological company since the beginning,” said the Economist professor Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology use,” said George Colona from the Forrester Research consulting company.
As the company says itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or - Big Blue - as it is because of its logo in the United States, it is familiaryly overlooking - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most comprehensive technology company - develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
They hold most patents from all American technology companies and five of their employees have won Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, credit card, financial swap, line code or disk.
IBM became the second largest technology company according to market capitalization this year (the first one is Apple), when Microsoft first came forward from 1996.
View forward
Not all products and innovations hit customers' taste and time - IBM has, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
“If your business is built on movement ahead, you cannot emotionally understand the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike a competitive Microsoft, which essentially stands and falls on Windows operating system.
Spectral technology
IBM’s market is the largest share of services, and after about five, it consists of software and hardware.
At the same time, in 1990 he was with more than half the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000 IBM sold little profitable assets worth $115 billion, during the same period invested $58 billion in purchasing future technologies.
In the investment, it has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis has been overflowing the world for the first time.
IBM is based on the reference of its first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased the volume of investment during the great economic crisis.
It seems so far that IBM is going through the current crisis not being touched.
IBM’s share price has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, net profit is increasing continuously.
IBM’s corporate password is to change everything, but not its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
History of IBM: From cheese walker to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York a hundred years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
IBM's name took over until 1924 - it was originally a brand used for branch offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM gave a merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1990 ’ s.
They included technologies such as pro-humans, i.e. hours recorded by employees of arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was the business of Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chaired by the supervisory board of the company by 1930.
Flint hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then outlined the founder of IBM - on Watson's ideas, it is still built an irresponsible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name suggests, started with the production and sale of all-power machines for business - from meat walkers and cheese to the cash register.
During the first four years, Watson's head office doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and started an extensive expansion of the company into all the worlds.
Watson was so intimidated to the company that, almost forty years in the boss' chair, he was replaced by his son Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960 ’ s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to drive flights to space - Mercur, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the number of IBM System/360.
The classic ‘péceécé,’ which established the computer standard at that time, called IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
20 years later, IBM sold the production of Lenovo's computers, on the contrary, bought a consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to provide advice and services with a high value added.
The strategy that has been paid out in the past three years by IBM - is the concept of Smarter Planet, the smarter planet -
Its aim is to use technology smartly in areas not yet planned and to improve the situation, for example, in the transport or management of cities.
For the trade area, the recently introduced IBM platform -Smarter Commercial - which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as in the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and there is also a research team of world levels dealing with voice recognition.
An unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtář (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and come home.
But now she's not waiting, and she set clear rules for her next life.
“Pepa can go home, but not as my partner,” explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtář's asylum provided Bartoš's asylum in her house in the summer, she probably didn't even seem to know how her marriage ended.
Even though Iveta had moved out of Rome for 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted he loved her.
In time, Darina gave up, with her husband's relationship, she was all mixed up, and now she even gave him a goodbye forever.
The knight doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If Rychtář and Bartoš only broke up once, his wife's open arms will not be waiting at home.
“He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wishes to live his life in our house together, no one will extort him.
“But he will experience it, not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I have some ties,” Rychtář told me that she was already separated from her husband and insists only on one another’s obedience.
The fact that Darina closed his back door, he's fine so far.
I respect the wife's decision -
I am going to be with Iveta, and I am not going to change it.
- The husband set up paper marriages and I respect that.
“The company goes on, I care about repair, garden, real estate, shopping,
“Dreina and I are having a full normal time, except that we don’t share bed together,” said Lightning Rychtář.
If Rychtář also found new love, she won't be able to defend her.
- We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he's going with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take all my responsibility,” Josef concluded.
The worst women's bad habits: Are they also yours?
If you ask the men if they could name any typical female bad habits, they're all in one of them's pretty tight, they're gonna throw them out of the sleeve.
Dear women, will you know in the following lines where several women's bad habits can perfectly pump blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your second half count to you that you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth per week?
You like shopping and mass discount?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least twist their shopping passion.
But tell me, which would resist going through the clothes stores, looking for a well-falling uppers, and then then try them all (and in different color versions) in the cab?
Even if it's for most women shopping with a horse, it can literally become a finished hell for a man.
Just remember how many times you've told your mother to wait for you before the entrance...
A constant dissatisfaction
- I'm not too fat -
- I need to lose at least five kilos - I should start practicing -
- I love you at all -
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you belong to the women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop looking after yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners always complain about their appearance.
Stronger sex also matches the fact that the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an endless colloidal.
Washing windows, drying, extortion of tiles, cutting of dust, crushing the tub - and at least twice a week.
You're counting to your partner that he's walking his dirty feet on a clean tiles, kids, that they've soiled a dirty sink and covered a glass living wall with which you've put so much work in it?
If you suffer from this “repeal” - try to realize that nothing is to overdo and order and purity should certainly not become part of the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for purity can jeopardise your relationships and family well-being.
Roast
-You used boxers put in the trash -
-You'll be wearing your old socks tomorrow too -
\"The wet cloth is not on the ground.\"
If you spend several times a day in your partner, know that you can effectively dial him out.
Of course you don't mean anything wrong, you're trying to get everything to be okay.
Maybe if the men knew that, the women wouldn't have to fight them so much again...
Apologizing, gossiping
For some women, there are also talks, gossip, and insulting and coping against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom and why.
I hope every one of us is going to let some harmless gossip or a curse out there.
Hand to heart, it's its own, perhaps, to all women.
On the contrary, however, the woodiest grains that they like and often shake, perhaps they are everyone's opposition and are for their surroundings - especially within the female work collection - especially dangerous.
Jigger and Voráček helped assist in the win of Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in the Monday’s game of the NHL two assists to win Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again at the head of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From an overview of the nine-year-old stars, Claude Giroux lived in both cases, who added another match and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists in the match also recorded Jagra's classmate Jakub Voráček.
After playing the overseas journalists, the Jigger said that Giroux had had a big evening.
I told him he'd give it to Gottrick before the game.
- I felt it--
“Sometimes you feel like this,” explained Jagr, after which Giroux goals from the first shot Flyers.
A few moments later, the second hit by a team of Czech tracks.
Voráček fought for the goal of Hurricanes the cat and presented it between the circles of the leather Maxi Talbot.
The second time before the first break, Patrick Dwyer's domestic player decreased, but the second part was back on Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jigger, he shot the third goal, then his shot turned into Wayne Simmonds on the fourth goal.
“I love to play with him,”
“I don’t want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs among the best three,” Jigger appreciated his centre.
“I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career,”
- That makes me happy -
I want to play with him.
“All these years in the NHL, my classmates tried to play at me, now it turns around,” Jagr added.
Carolina made a drama yet, a goal of Tuoma Ruutua, and again Dwyer, who settled off the penalty shooting, got to the difference between one goal.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read to end the number two to one.
“Excellently struck in our Pronger zone -
“He pushed the cat, I went up fast, and (Read) he went to a far more distant bar -
“I tried to hit him, and I am glad it worked out,” he described the last goal of the game in his view, Voráček.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not play against Buffal, in the second third he resigned due to injuries in the upper part of the body.
Candiens, next to the experienced beka, lost a double-browning line and lost a penalty shot of 2:3.
One of their raids did not change Tomáš Plekanec.
A home coach rather than a lost body was freezing a large middle of the back row, while the match was recorded only on five defenders.
- It's bad.
“We were only playing with one experienced player, the rest of them were young people,”
But there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,” Jacques Martin said.
“The shooting at the shooting took place upon us, and we couldn’t resist.
“We were supposed to simplify the game, push the puck out of our belt.”
In this we had gaps,” added one of the defenders of P.K. Subban.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions of Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters have been divided up about the Jets goal that interrupted the five-game Proher series.
How the tour prices developed since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel agencies were permitted in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recreza and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in the vast majority only tours to the countries of the socialist block, since travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled on vacation to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soch on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslavian regime tended to the West and the paths of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were then very limited.
The great paradox of the period of socialism was that it was not a citizen of the socialist block (i.e. also of Bohemia) allowed to travel individually freely in the socialist countries.
If he wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of action from this country, otherwise there was no individual route possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand a front overnight with a sparak or have a good friend in a travel agency.
However, it was not won either.
The commission promise, which was a condition for the journey to the West, was not granted to ‘politically unsatisfied people, who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (separate currency) on the way to the West.
Most often, Czechs spent their holiday in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages, which Czechs have taken, and this habit survives today.
Traveling to the Czechs has had a real revolution since 1989.
While she was on vacation in the NDR or Bulgaria with our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4,5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely until 1989 to the most popular Croatia, because it was part of the time of Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, visa waivers occurred to neighbouring Western European countries, which set off a huge wave of short-term visits mainly in the Austrian Vienna or Germany.
Czechs couldn't have been able to get trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for at least a minute.
In Paris, for example, tours of the Czech Republic in the tents were burned, since our income did not allow us to pay our hotel or guesthouse.
The typical feature of Czech travel was at this time to bring its own food, cannings, salamis, etc. to save themselves.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech crown, so our tourists could finally buy Western currency for many decades.
But our level of living, and with that, the average wages rose, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours of charter air connections regularly since 1997, thus making air trips possible to negotiate quantitative discounts compared to the past incredibly decreased.
In the late 1990 ’ s, Czech visa-free relations have been practically in all the developed countries of the world, except in the USA, which has continued to make our journey easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of porous travel occurred right in 2000, when due to the considerable demand made by the Czech Republic historically first direct charter flight to exotic, it was in Thailand.
From this year so each year they fly with Czech tourists direct charters to warm far countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The exotic countries will now visit around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our evolution, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States cancelled the visa for Czech tourists and our country definitely included itself among the most successful countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent the first time in history more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and spent the first time in history for one foreign holiday, including more than 15 thousand CZK per person.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but he's at risk again.
Almost five months is Czech football without the chairman and threatens to be the successor of Ivan Haška in the Czech Republic's Fotbal Association (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburce.
There is still no agreement, according to which order the vote will be followed.
Without it, he will not even begin to vote on which of the three candidates he will be elected.
The interest in leading Czech football has Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned as a function in June and invited colleagues to unite and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hašk's football, he jumped back to the ground between the two union chambers that could not agree to a common candidate.
It turned out to be on September 16 when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Meeting took place in the National House in Prague in Smíchov, which was lost because the negotiations were blocked and not just a way of election.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in a meeting - whether only the statutory representatives or even the officials of the full power.
In this one point since then, there has been a partial agreement to which the recommendations of the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power are not possible.
But they're still in charge of the electoral order.
The Executive Committee, which at its meetings, whether proper or extraordinary, has not, in principle, brought much light into the situation.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neural point is still the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the 3rd round to rule out the possibility of a heel?
“The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model,” one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda, representing professional football in charge of the association.
According to the terms of the proposed model in the third round, he will win from candidates who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to retreat to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side promotes the condition that the winner must obtain at least two-thirds advantage during this percentage calculation.
“However, since this would have left the sense of two previous rounds, it would completely deny the concept of a two chamber,“ he understands the opposition of the Moravian side of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the current statutes.
Thomas Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the statutes designated by the Rules of Procedure comply with most Pelt’s candidates.
I wish it to be chosen according to the statutes,
“In order not to think of some clumsy nonsense as at the last general meeting,” declared Viktorie Plzen, who was running for the first time and in his observations, primarily opposed Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburce, according to him, will be known by the new President and believe that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
“All passions will calm down if possible today’s national team course for Europe’s Championships -
“Fotbal will be in a happy wave, more willing to cooperate,” says a Japanese actor, who has the greatest experience in football management as well as at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more sustainable.
\"I hope in the deal, but unfortunately, the situation is very dilated.\"
“It is not between Czech and Moravian people, but there are attempts to adapt to regulations in an orderly manner.
- This can cause the blocking of the general meeting to occur again -
“I hope that a sound mind will prevail,” said Rajchl.
There is no longer much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality would be complete in the match.
The air special in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things, Vice-Presidents Dalbor Kučera and Rajchl, did not fly from Prague because of the technical breach of the morning and sought for an alternative variant, as part of the executive committee in the scene of the baler recovery.
Finally, there may be a decisive meeting at the Ministerial level that can be reportedly held on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to use the divided sides within the strongest sport association in the country to agree.
In the game there is a lot: state subsidy, credibility of football and also a planned general meeting of ČSTV, which will deal with the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pack goes to fight for the President because he can't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of football players in Plzně Tomáš Pacík saw a strong candidate in front of a special general meeting that would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) nor would he have volunteered to fight for the top function.
“If there was a good adoption, I am fighting for it, and I am not going to the election -
But in the current situation no one could find such a thing,” said ČTK Pacík.
To the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchlem female Paclík's motivation to just get Pelt's alleged favorite election, tried to stop himself from going to FAČR's forehead.
The Package also stresses that, in the event of its victory, only until 2013, when a proper general meeting is held on the agenda.
As a function, he would like to see an experienced and top manager, who is not too involved with football events.
I spoke of some people who would come into account.
“For me, it was crazy when some people said that at this moment they didn’t even want to identify themselves with the Czech football.”
I would like to change that view,” he said.
He said now that he is most concerned about Peltovo's connection with President of the Pilsen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general meeting.
It's so unacceptable that Pelta should stand in the chair position.
“If he won, the current state will be preserved and nothing would move forward in football”
“In combination with Berbra’s support, which is a suitable businessman, football would not have improved even more,” said Paclíc.
It also points out that Peltovo's name came from years ago during the investigation of the corruption affair, which, however, came out of Pelta without punishment.
\"I don't know what prestige Pelt's football would bring victory.\"
- And as we would also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclík, who also takes with the view of his later statement that he would sell the county club if Pelta had become chairman -
If Pacík had triumphed in his fourth election, he could have imagined future cooperation with Pelta.
In the same way, another candidate Rajchl, supported by Pacík before the September General, which ended with fiaske.
-He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go after.
- He has great skills -
\"I could imagine him as head of representation.\"
But managerial managers couldn't drive an association.
“I also don’t put my nose where I can’t,” said Pacík, who raised great attention in September by the fact that he was behind the appeal of the Board of Judges at the head of Ludek Macelou, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Pacík says he'd be in charge of the trouffle association.
He has appealed to his ability to manage private companies, since last years he has also been running Pilsen, who has celebrated the prime league triumph with his support in May.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to his specific culture.
In order to limit the effects of some interest groups that tend to affect the discipline and appeal of the Commission, which goes beyond the disgusting situation,” said Paclíl, who do not cover their antipathies, for example, to the Spartan chief of Daniel Křetín.
One of the priorities would also consider the establishment of the FAČR relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it would help political spies lobby for more money from lottery taxes to sport.
\"This is one of the key issues that the new President should address,
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but on a plane they must say where the money is going,” he noted.
As a burden now, Paclík does not even take his connection with the Plzenian club, for he himself claims that the President of the FAPR should be “intensive” -
Pelta is back connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Duklou.
-It's not ideal.
“I don’t even see the point in being able to transfer my stock to someone in the county club and return in a year and a half,” Paclí said.
Pelta promised the new FAČR statutes to rule out the electoral path
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the case of the election, the FAČR would have new statutes that would eventually exclude disputes over the election order in the future.
The Jablonec fincenary is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburce optimist and believes that the pre-election struggle significantly reduces the possible success of football representation today.
Pelta had already promised before the September’s unrealistic choice that it was for representation and acquisition of finance that he intends to concentrate in the case of the election.
In the election before the last round, he decided to go to the last minute, and so he could use two months to defend his ideas about football management and introduce himself in a broader context.
“The people at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect Thursday to be the chairman of the president to be known“
“It feels that it is high time for an association to lead,” my husband, who is associated primarily with the jablonec club, but who has worked in the Association and Executive Committee of the Union for many years.
That's why he thinks he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that the current challenge of choice is euphoria, which reigned in Ivan Haska's reign.
‘Borhužel at the June General Assembly has been approved by statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.
“If different interpretations were not supported, we had already had a chair since September,” Pelta pointed out.
He just reworked the most important document of the civil association as the majority of delegates.
“If I become President, I will take this as a personal task and I am willing to exercise my personal responsibility if it fails.”
“It is a fundamental matter that we cannot be without,” Pelta says.
He said he's always trying to stay out of his opponents.
He earlier saw that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognised because of his legal education, and he knows that his anti-procurement would be his first chair.
He didn't even attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which, on the contrary, did not let Pelt get away with it.
“In football, it's been moving over a year, and it's already gained some success, ” he said.
“His attacks, however, were unworthy and many of the people in the way of the election campaign,” he said.
“And so many of them are now doubting its true character,” said Pelta’s protégé address, who said that he remained faithful to the prophets that he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competition to the representation.
That should be an interpretational football box.
“And I would also try to end all the affair starting with Godians or the last year’s corruption scandal -
“Well, I would have gotten into negotiations with the private and state sector to secure enough money for the whole football,” said ČTK six-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival in the head of football would not mean any personnel cleaners.
“I would first have to familiarize myself with the filling of individual employees,” he pointed to Strahov, where there is an understandable nervousness in the long run.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that run through the general meeting, they believe that on Thursday they will not go delegates to Nyburk.
“If the only disputed point is how he will vote in the third round, we will be able to move over it.”
“Fotbal needs credibility, and here it will only gain by finally having its leader again,” Pelta remains two days before the possible decisive day of his acting career for optimist.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR would start working hard under him.
If the new President of the Czech Republic was elected Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
The Rajchl promises to start working hard in the case of his election.
He wants to make systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohanians bail, improve relations with the UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that the previous President Ivan Hašek began.
\"As president, I would like to take part in football as a whole.\"
-From international contacts with UFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to young people -
“But I am not saying that I would do everything myself,” said Rajchl in an interview for the Czech Republic.
“I am a team player and I want to share competence in an executive committee so that each member is dedicated to certain areas,
-And I'll give up hard tasks to move football in each segment by a mile step forward -
“A lot of people would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement he said he wasn't going to run again.
I know I'm doing 20 hours a day.
“But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks under my feet and question every step of mine,” he explained why he hesitated.
“But many people told me that I should not give up, because then others would give up.”
“This is a trust I can’t just throw away,” he said.
He was motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Haška.
- I've done a lot of work in these two years, and I don't want to throw it away now -
“They are launched processes that will be called even in a few years, and I would hate to have someone stop them,” he stated with concern that if another candidate was elected Miroslav Pelty, he could have returned to the union until Hashek was elected.
\"I believe in systematicity, and this is a matter that Mirek Pelt, according to me, does not know.\"
“For him, people who would make football are primarily bound, so that he would be chosen only for those who chose.
“A lot of things can be calculated, but certainly not by partying to one another.
- I'm trying to be objective -
“I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just your choice,” said Rajchl.
He also points out that he would be just a Czech chairman.
- Even though some people try to say the opposite, I plan on making Moravia the maximum -
For example, it is time to consider that the second league would split into the Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league -
“There would be no present situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia,” said Rajchl.
As the Head of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík joined the fight against the President, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
“But I can still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President, and sees that there are clear successes behind me,” said Rajchl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns on unworthy contracts, contract contracts and negotiations on the air force.
On the contrary, the union doesn't pull a rope.
While he claims to Pelt he is “disqualified to return to Czech trust football, the second of Paclík’s rivals considers it a strong candidate who has the football to offer.
“No one can question that in Pilsen he did a great job during that year -
“If he was elected, perhaps he would continue to do things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not substantially change the staff office in the committees”
“He would not want to do it in his favor,” says the rival Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
Julia Stanek
From the view of the Uphone, a high-speed pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after touring cities or travelling to let your tired feet rest in thermal baths.
The book will show you where wellness is most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder was published in the past one and a half years on a discovery journey, it was not possible to miss her luggage: her swimmers.
By lying on the water sign, she looked up to the height of the artisticly formed dome, sailed across the marble putti (a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) who waited for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully-restaurant Artery.
If she liked some of the plérnas, she brought her into her journal - even with remarkable details about how to build and history of the building.
More than 200 regiments were explored in this way by the historian of Meder's architecture and now present in her published book “Badefreuden (Badefreuden of swimming)”: Lidové plernany in Munich, historical palaces plováren in Schwarzwald,“Tvdý core of concrete buildings - in Taunus.
The 13 countries led it to France, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for plovárenian culture.
It's not too much sport, it says Meder-- it's just in the water, it's something else.
To anger, it is only that fan swimming must be satisfied with blue tiles and a smell of soil, while the runners for health can inhale the anointing odorous odorous odorous odorous odors or listen to the happy shrilling of birds in the park.
“One day, I asked why the weeds must always be so gray,” says Ms. Meder living in Vienna.
So I began to gather a nice weed -
Water level doubles architecture
Singing in a jumping pool and essential oils for sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be a floating real trap for their eyes: ‘The place of the floor has a man in the spa water level -
But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building.
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, varied tiles, jumper board.
The Maloformate Image Volume -Badefreuden (Badefreuden from bathing) - provides all that needs to be known about the architectural and cultural history of historical oasis - but above all, the desire to jump to the blue.
The observed specimens discovered the collector of Mrs. Meder's plentiaries while searching for her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing baths, like 100 years of old Széchenyi spas in Budapest, she found water with nitrates in the original karst caves (the cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose swimming pools are filled with alkacalic water and are located in the building of the shape of the bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jaszberéna).
A beautiful look on the other hand, they offer many plateaus under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. However, while a person has one of the Curishian Mediterranean swimming pools in the eyes of the entire city, he can look at the snow covered by Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which he can watch the movement on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most appropriate design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Akvapark Ötztal looks like an ufo that just landed in the Alps.
Out of the three top open men in winter, a couple rises so far as in the background of the Mount Ötztalu ski to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every floor, he had a pool collector, Mrs. Meder, swimming in the flu.
Many thermal baths are feeling at the sea, in the spa Arpad in the Hungarian Bekescsaba, it smells like heating oil to the extent that a person barely believes that he got into a healing bath.
The smell comes from the healing water with the contents of alkaly hydrogenulates, which is almost black and whose ovaries stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
But also one place was Iris Meder in her search of nice spa disappointed: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate bath Luhačovice, she ran into a closed terrain.
In 1902 architect Dušan Jurkovič designed spas were closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the falling windows of the red-white and yellow Art Building, she saw how massively growing weeds between tiles.
On the other hand, they built themselves in a magic platform in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildrad.
These spas already have three phases of construction; a man can discover not only the neo-Roman elements that come from his creation in 1844 but also the Maurian hall in Alhambra style, which was connected around 1900.
From careful modernisation 1995 Palais Thermal is a popular spa place of the Iris Meder swimming pools, not only because Schwarzwald comes from.
“It’s already some performance, to combine such diverse buildings into such a beautiful complex,” says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace there is probably a marginal issue in the thermal pool.
Aggressive speculation
Deutsche Bank lets the trade in commodities be verified
Christian Teams
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann assigned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, then, the chief of the company wants to cause consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, this is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate agricultural raw materials as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the questions even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to step out of this business because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch Consumer Organisation.
The study is based on the report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows the author of Harald Schumann that the stakes for global commodity exchanges are eroding prices up to a height and therefore banks have a global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act alike.
Initially, commodity bets were intended to ensure that traders are guaranteed against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, the majority of experts agree that the shareholders of the capital market with interest in high risk trades have been disconnected from the supply and demand - and gained profits in the worst-case account.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that he would check out the charges and say that no business would be worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake.
According to information, SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the international working group of extracts from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit will be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation on how it should be made.
By January, then, the representatives of the Bank want to communicate what the consequences will be.
At the end, the reduction in trade in commodities or even complete refusal could be.
Ackermann works with his help on his image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened its criticism of the financial sector: ‘The betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how the banks are hurting general welfare today’
Tell Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyist to be charged.
“Deutsche Bank must cut off its portfolio all items for which money is used for food price bets”, said Bode.
“It is clear whether Mr Ackermann is about the hunger of people suffering or the reputation of Deutsche Bank”
Ackermann's point of view appears to be surprising, but it is clear that the company's boss several months before he left the office would like to leave the perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Head of the Board would not go to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from disputed aggressive speculation, it could improve its image.
And the potential loss may not have to be taken care of - with that he should eventually advise his successor.
Any other investment in raw materials would have answered
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have been involved so far on the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published an annex in which the Institute of Forsa on 7 and 8 November questioned 1001 people.
At the same time, 11 percent of this is considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to food prices.
Many customers of the bank would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: each other would, as a result of the survey, explain all the investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn people before such a bank, 49 percent said that they were thinking about elapseing their account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved baboon
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy end: Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prices, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and abandoned.
It is now opened again as an exhibition house.
When it is hot for modern postwar architecture, for bright forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials, which are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a grand and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavinon received then the Grand Prix d'Architecture with its light and powerful construction of steel and glass.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He famous the architect so that he also built a pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-year-old BMW burning plus as a key to a side construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous.
Its construction as a temporary exhibition building designed after the world exhibition was located in Schweizer Garten in the Vienna Südahhnhof (Ježního station), renovated and opened in 1962 by the Museum of the 20th century - it was named “The House of the 20th century”.
But it was not suitable for the museum building, either spatially or technically - there were no walls to hang art exhibits, no matching climate.
Still, it was used until the present art was in Vienna's new stand.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilon has renovated, now bears the name of the 21st century House, and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, whose palace belongs to, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted art historian with outstanding career, among others in the youth of the Krasobuler, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim museu, and as the founding director of Musea moderna Salzburg, has put a considerable reconstruction on politicians and memorials, as public funds and private sponsor money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the artist Fritz Zrubby should be exhibited by the same foundation, a coffee shop and bookshop should be created, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Direct supervision, low budget.
After that, Krischanitz was ideally occupied.
Not only did he restore and expand the Art Nouveau construction of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because Schwanzer studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilon was an extremely important place for him, where he looked at exhibitions every weekend.
He knew the spring project, and he also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its use in Vienna and lost its generosity and lightness.
At the present reconstruction, there were far more problems: The building was a “catapult for energy” - says Krischanitz.
The windows of glass facades have been replaced, used glass fibres reinforced with insulation glass and glass roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Cool bridges and steel beams have been strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos filled with ceilings can be sanated.
Two underground floors have provided a place for new applications, an abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, leading to the entrance of the bridge - almost new construction, but still a powerful Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is mounted in an old anti-corrosion red brown color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this for strict supervision of the Memorial Office and the low budget.
The material, which is good and cheap, must have been found, and also liked the Memorial Office, says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
He said that it was with the pavilion that came here from Brussels, said recently Krischanitz, typical of the Drop-in-the-City-his history.
Such architecture is always in the wrong place, and yet it wants to build proper self-confidence.
In this case, however, the 21st century house is not at an insignificant place, as urbanistic happy coincidence happened: In the circle around Schweizer Garten there is a completely newly designed district at the Main Station, with office and residential houses.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence arises: The 21st century House could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Hamburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and as they heard, is already dealing with a city on a neighborhood in Schweizer Garten.
The path is planning a package for the winter crisis at a million
The path blew out a crisis plan to prevent train failures during the winter period.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train failures, Deutsche Bahn issue more than 70 million euros this year according to the news.
The new-Bilds brought a preliminary report with a reference to the internal market plan that it was estimated by 2015 in total with investments of around EUR 300 million.
It will help to achieve better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external employees on 16 000 persons to remove snow on railway facilities and entrances.
The aim is to remove the platform into the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary outlets within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Drah Rüdiger Grube warned the chief of Drah Rüdiger after meeting at the highest level with government leaders and industry before train accidents and delays also during this winter.
During the last winter period, the track had significant problems in personal transport, as, inter alia, under difficult weather conditions, there was a lack of reserve.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the operation of ICE trains
For years, the track also does not manage that it must be more likely to let the train repair ICE control more often when it occurred at one train ICE at the Köln Main Station to destruct the axles.
Deutsche Bank pays a million penalty in the US
After a break around Chef Josef Ackermann, there is a new trauma in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of compensation.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer had any problems at home, it was still in charge of his past in the United States: Frankfurt institutions pay $ 145 million in one compensatory management (106 million) to settle disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage sheets.
The NCUA financial market regulator calculates a number of large banks that have brought in cooperative banks false promises to buy financial products; that risks may have decreased.
Such papers have lost significantly in the course of the crisis, and have put banks in the breach.
“We are satisfied that we have been able to solve the subject without having to be led to court,” said Deutsche Bank spokesperson in New York.
The bank of compensation does not admit any guilt.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The President of the NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the honor of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and will recover from bankruptcy to protect customers' claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for billion damage.
Now the settlements are the first of their kind.
The controller also joined other large banks and in summer JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
This is called Mortgage-backed Securitys.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US bubble around the real estate in 2007, it became a number of financial firms fateful.
In September 2008, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking at the top of the financial crisis.
Even though the event occurred a few years ago, it is now blowing a sharp wind into the banks in the mouth.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous actions to remedy or affect doubt.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FhaFA) has launched the biggest lawsuit.
It states to 18 international bigies that two state-owned investors dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac real estate transactions in mortgages amounted to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also face the FHFA action, here are more transactions worth about 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority shall require that the Francfurt Institute be responsible for significant losses, without, however, an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and stated that she wanted to defend herself.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion to IBM
Buffett's financial guru invests heavily in IBM's IT business.
He bought more than $10 billion shares since March.
So far, an important American investor Warren Buffett has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers, as long-term business development will only be able to predict difficulties.
However, he now read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investments in the brand.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and manages IT-sharing systems for other companies.
The investment of Warren Buffetta in the financial world is considered a passion for knights.
As a result, it is possible to call the IBM mother's rock now -Sir IBM -
For Buffy betrayed the CNBC's U.S. radio station that he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Investment Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffy sagte that even IBM has not known anything about his involvement yet.
He praised management, which tried for the economic crisis, even for proper returns.
\"You did a great job,\" said Buffy to the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lurking IT services such as the operation of calculation centres.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneers also offer software and consulting and powerful computers for companies.
Buffy had rather been avoiding technology companies until today.
It claims that it invests only in undertakings whose activities also understand.
Instead, Buffett was hit by a freight railway, by the manufacturers of lubricants or after the manufacture of machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns a total of 80 own subsidiaries as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over a small textile company named Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built with it a wise investment by one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost inseparable sense of money making brought him a nickname - Omaha Oracle (Omaha’s Omaha miracle -)
When Buffy’s investment became known, IBM’s shares increased by one percent prior to the start of the storm.
“Big Blue, as IBM is also called, has more than $ 220 billion on the stock market and is based together with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, so much Buffy, but he wouldn't want to get in.
The founder of Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The threat is tangible
Following the detection of the ‘Bunnies in Zwickau, Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The news even speaks of a “bloodful ideology” that is now being relived.
The murders of eight minor entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a right extreme background.
In Turkey and within Germany, the German-Turkey population responded with fear and mayors.
For for many German Turks, it returns back to terror, which was long considered dead: From the gloom attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no comparable violence with the right extreme background.
That in Germany there was never any doubt about xenophobia.
However, the discovered right-wing extremissic network reveals a range that cannot be seen long ago.
“Relives the Blood Ideology,” the headlines of the Internet release of Turkish newspapers, Haberturk,
Noviny -Sabah - stressing, on the other hand, that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police officer for the protection of the constitution and fear that the German authorities might also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality responded seriously: she reminded about the weekend of the demonstration of silence before Brandebur’s gate of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, along with German and Turkish politics, was reminded by a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkey Association.
In happy colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
As a Polish, several Turkish media are reported here: “The German gift to the fifty - is a title of the article in the Turkish Internet Platform - Haber X - which suggests the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter, Hürriyet, for Germany, cannot be taken not to make this mental connection.
The title is from Ahmet Külahec.
He emphasises that people who paid taxes and their work were murdered to bring an important contribution to the recovery of Germany.
The most critically discussed in German online forums is the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why didn't the German authorities think much earlier to search the suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, a number of demonstrations are carried out at least rhetorically for the use of drastic means: ‘If it continues to be carried out so lightly, there will be nothing other than own defence and armed forces.
- That'll be the best self-defense.
“For the quality of clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the internal peace in Germany”, writes “Selen”
Which means, if the inner peace is at risk in Germany, it explains the atents in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
Photo of the burn plant in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown here to the living Turks that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence
However, at the end of Turk’s strengths, they saw a better feeling of mutuality.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attachés was primarily criticized: Helmut Kahl rejected those in Mölln, who survived to visit.
After the fire attack in Solingen, he sent a condolences to the Turkish State President, but he left himself at the sad festival at Köln to join his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at that time in his speech, calculated what fees the Turks gave up.
Kind of like the value of a human being is measured according to the height of his taxes.
The current Turkish media news shows once again how deep it is to distrust many German Turks in this state-owned arrangement.
In addition to trying to make extensive clarifications and a new evaluation of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
The Scandinavian Bank at the Curyšský Lake
The most profitable bank of Europe has no seat in Italy or France but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis, and since then, it has fallen from one crisis to another.
Now it has some sort of Germany to compare it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noise departure from the head of the management of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would enter almost the same spectular new employment: the President of the Swiss General Board of Grand Banks of UBS - an unexpected and archuric step in the career.
Axel Weber looked forward to the public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidarity, and said friendly notes to future colleagues.
‘Die UBS has reached turnover’
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villier and Oswald Grübel -
But already in September, it was clear that everything would be different.
One UBS dealer in London covered all bank security systems, and approximately 1.7 billion euros have been lost.
The head of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's recognized banker, had to leave.
The president of the board of directors of the UBS has since been drunk - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber bank since February 2012 can advise.
And the Presidency of the Management Board will take over in May - not only in 2013 as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be hard for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, rather a professor of economics, and an emission banker, and he certainly needs time to work.
At the same time, he will take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just once again proved to be worthy of the title:Banka of the greatest scandals in Europe -
However, the UBS is huge - until recently the world’s largest asset manager - and it has been the case for years since one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems, will not remain a proud Swiss bank saved.
It started with a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS was enjoying excellent reputation.
Image milky and solid, but also high-end asset managers are combined with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So, UBS 2007 managed on one side with a 1.6 trillion of more money-free clients than any other bank of the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she joined the leagues of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker and later-year-old banking professor at Zurich Hans Geiger tells us: ‘I have always been a good bank model for my students at that time’
“From today’s perspective, a person asks, ‘How could I be so wrong? ’
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first obvious that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli's surprisingly chief of board, who has been considered to be highly intelligent as well as a brilliant banker.
In a few months later, it suspected why he left.
The bank's investment division has been compromised by Subprime, and it has to write down billions.
To stop it, UBS saw an increase in capital of really 13 billion francs.
Thus, she found real investors, but one that would recently include the nose: the insensitive Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that a person did not even know his name.
But it was just the first hit.
It's been getting worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to admit new billions of losses, the President of Marcel Ospel's board, 2006, the second best-paid Swiss management board, has resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood due to its incorrect investment in the financial crisis before collapse and had to be saved by the State.
The Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on compulsory exchange bonds for which she could have become the bank's co-owner.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has so large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times larger than the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“One day we could not save UBS” says the bank expert Geiger.
In the first disaster, there's another one.
For several months, UBS has capitalised in a tax dispute with America, and has shown its willingness to issue data to wealthy customers, who have been taxed by the bank as far as possible.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on irregular profits from these transactions, including fine deductions.
This meant UBS more or less openly that it helped to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what was earlier.
The resignation of the Head of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors followed.
And exodus' money.
Thus, during several months, the Bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: In investment banking due to poor speculation and management of assets for aiding tax cuts.
And just when things got a little calm again, just when they thought that UBS was recovering again, this unfortunate business asset is coming: the only dealer died EUR 1.7 billion before the bank pointed out something was wrong.
And it's clear: the risk management in investment banking is probably not yet working.
The case of Adooli was probably found to have changed too little, says Martin Janssen, the economy and Finanz professor of finance at the Zürich University of Banks.
The financial manager of the large German bank is also sure: ‘The applicable UBS is that it does not control the risks’
This was precisely the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers advanced long ago, to become Watchers of great wealth of the world: no too much risk, no security for money - also from this side the Alpine Republic has collapsed the world again.
The security of the Swiss banks has become a symbol for untraceable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly good chocolate.
The UBS Centre in Zurich is still suitable for a great Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is already classic.
The Bank has its main seat in the Curyšská Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curisha lake, which is framed by snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, selling shops is one of the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's will be found here between Swiss traditional stores as sugar shop Sprüngli.
For centuries there have been banks of Switzerland: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, there is a massive leather chair, next to the logo of the bank a large direction towards the “seyfu”
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss banks both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - pushed or betrayed how they found out the boss of one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not read in the paper, eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with the two large banks of business.
The UBS has probably increased too much, and it is, above all, in investment banking, where the Anglossas have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything to say.
- And if they were to adapt to the long-term English ways.
Indeed, it was an English investment banking that changed UBS, brought it back to high profits and then a disaster: No European Financial Institution lost so much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
“In the middle of the city, the government coalition of the small seven million countries has fallen to the greatest rescue event in the history of its nation,” writes Lukas Hässig in his book “Der UBS-Crash”
Up to 68 billion francs or around €45 billion, politicians have agreed to save from the bankruptcy of a large bank.
How could this happen?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined the massive company.
There was a bank that was already too large for a small Switzerland merger - and still grew.
In this way, it was helped that both different bank predecessors of UBS were added: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with the mining centre in the management of assets and poorer, but internationally more strongly involved.
Suddenly, the internalised investment bankers came to an advantage of a lot of money with which large Roulettes could be turned on.
Two names are associated with this increase: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Management Board.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the future team,” says Hans Geiger's bank expert.
“Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows much about models and statistics and Ospel, a man managing his feelings around his stomach, who has worked out completely from banking science”
But Ospel was relying on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made decisive mistakes at the end: “As you thought his models were reality,” says Geiger.
- This is a tragic case -
Tragic, perhaps.
Of course, pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the possessions of managers, on which the company chief Wuffli repeated the same password again: Beat Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She was reporting on League Tables, a orderr documenting the success of the bank of that time.
In it, UBS was trying to put the location completely up top.
Several steps have already been successful.
In the foreign exchange trade and the shares participated in the games completely above.
However, business advisers who have been entrusted stress one weakness: In international interest business, in banks’ language,Fixed Income, there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS has probably had spaces in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS agreed to an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Following growth, they invested both the bank itself and its own fund to ensure the risk to US investments Subprime.
It developed in a powerful machine that repacked on American mortgage loans and passed on - but also left himself at risk.
Also, when other banks were long looking for east.
“Just in summer 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it,” says the bank expert Geiger.
As big as eupories, so deep a fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
UBS positions have become a catapulting seat and until today with a swing.
Who runs a big bank now has almost an insurmountable job.
They must find a strategy for banks that all the close business models have disappeared.
The Bank expert Geiger has an idea: End with investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
It's not as far as the bank wants to go.
But investment banking is going to be heavily wasted, so is now clear.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti wants to introduce his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only understood as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor of Grübel.
In the meantime, he settled down: It has long-term business management of UBS, communicated to the Curysian bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 places are cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber already asks.
But she's not public yet but she's only saying that she's gonna find her lady first in Zurich's apartment.
Next year.

Smart gates are expanding in cities
In many places they are considered a field crashman for “problem birds”: However, in cities, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be released, says experts.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The gates are for centuries in the image of the city, yet in some municipalities complaints of the population to the uncleanness and noise caused by the animals.
It is therefore not against the ‘problem birds’, yet in the supervision of some kind of means.
The field Havrans probably can't leave the city any more, said experts on the first symposia about the gates in East Africa Leera.
There, experts from all over the federal territory were advised about possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Protectors of nature also brought the problems of cities from the exodus of particularly protected field pests: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about to a growing extent destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecuting, growing construction and preaching typical trees to nest birds make life harder.
The gates are protected.
Large colonys with more than 600 nesting couples are among others in the Westphal Soest, in the Northwest, among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Brem and Leeru.
There he called 2005 a major project of mass killing of verna in the rural period of negative headlines.
Critics called to catch animals into a trap for birds and killing cages for especially brutal.
“Normal extortion, weeping, nothing to bring - so much has been discovered by the urbanist and the landscaper Werner Klöver of Leeru.
The removal of nests by squirting water or rocking trees often has adverse consequences, also said an expert on the environment of Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Badensk-Württembergsk.
“The animals are retreating, large colonys are barking and divided into other places,
The beach is thought only as an exception to hospitals, pension homes or schools.
We must live with them. We will not get them out of here.
Without the surrounding territory, cities cannot be dealt with, the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leeru.
It is thought that the combination of extortion of animals from sensitive residential areas and their introduction to be settled in other places.
“Intellecting tables instead of chain saws,” promoted the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals:“One death in the face can eventually become best of self-esteem.
Mrs Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's teaching path to provide information board of instruction about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said, in the meantime, already accepted by tourists.
Mrs Jürgens also had an opinion on the criticism of the bird’s noise: ‘This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say,
The intelligence and chicism of animals are legendary: the Havranians do not use field aid only to achieve a pamphlet, but even as an aid to their instrument will be made known.
Students from Cambridge University have recently tested behaviour on four field ravens, as far as a bird intelligence is achieved.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that the stones had to bring to an end the construction to reach a light pier.
Without great training they knew what size and shape they had to have a stone to make collapses of the platform.
In the second attempt, the lubricated gates had to solve a more lurking problem.
In a vertical cylinder, researchers placed a small container with a clear pier.
The birds could not reach their prey by means of an obligation.
But the researchers put a piece of wire in them.
Of them, all four animals were made of hooks, which, as a slinging, hunted from a tube of a canopy.
Three of the four field ravens managed to even make it through the back.

Massacre on personal level
A powerful new book by Peter Englanda, called Beauty and Sadness: The Trustful History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of rising figures when your head spins out of it.
One advice, how do you behave at that moment: take this page easy and make it a deposit.
For with all people you will know very well in the novel story of Mr Englanda, and this list will serve you as a navigationist - as some may - in moments, when you will feel confused and lost in various situations as well as men and women in the story.
Mr Englund is Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new assistant at the Swedish Academy, which awards Nobel Prize for literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author itself describes it, quite early, as a “anti historical work“
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energy journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It is not even a book about what happened, it explains the author, as it were “the book about what it was,” it deals mainly with “the feelings, the impressions, experiences and moods, ”
“Beautiful and sadness” includes 20 more and less dozen men and women, both sides of the barricade, from students and botanist to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives are like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the skin of destiny while others are shrouding.
Mr Englanda's book is different from classical historical novels.
It regulates the idea that the first world war was just about the horrific troubles on the West Front.
- Beauty and sorrow - researchs other places where there was war drama: Alps, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that the bee nest falls on them, must spend Christmas in the shade of pyramids or face the presence of flies tse-ts.
Almost from the beginning, it's very touching reading.
The war consumes people's lives like some natural disaster, like the hurricane Katrina smelling gunpowder.
If a gun starts to ring a gun in the distance and you're a woman who's home with her kids, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, even why the whole war was launched.
“The vacuum resulting from the lack of facts,” noted Mr Englund,“ was filled with densities, ideas, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and femies.
The beauty and sorrow of individuals, such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stupf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from resumes, letters and other materials already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and sad, but thanks to the inclusion of minor moments and details, they are completely alive and credible.
A lot of them deal with spending and dealing with him.
In the story of the German student, the author says: ‘Náhražky, just substitutes everywhere -
- Coffee substitute, aluminium copy, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons -
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to ‘mass produced from milled rice cooked in root fat (and supplemented with fake wood bone), tobacco of dried roots and dried potatoes, buttocks with wooden soles;
It mentions that there were 837 registered meat substitutes in the manufacture of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes -
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds itself in inner motions for wildness and brutality, where he declares war: ‘You will understand that this is the human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretending that your mask represents civilization and that there is no barbarar behind that squeezed me in the nitra.’
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die, and no one will notice, let alone mourn.
“When one finally agrees with the sacrifice, he would expect at least that it would happen before the eyes of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, however, he seems to be the “consequence that he secretly hangs up“
Other comments concern the departure of old Europe and the introduction of new horrors.
“The conflict has become more and more competitive in economic competition and competition,” writes Mr Englund, “the war between factories,”
He captures what he says of the “new type of beast of the coming century: the ecclesiastes, and the ideally attached mass killer in the clothes of peace that he carries out his bloodshed without coming up from the table“
People act totally unexpected, they change heroic.
Mr Englund describes also soldiers who deliberately attempted to catch some sexual illness to avoid serving on the front.
“The most important example of this behavior was the trafficking in gonoko manure, which the soldiers bought and burdened their genitals in the hope that they would end up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those most trusted were pushing it into their eyes, which often blinded them to the rest of their lives. ”
In this translation from Swedish from Peter Graves, Mr. Englanda's song is fresh, but it is not visible, which fits his human subject perfectly.
In dozens of minor outputs, it captures the way the war has spread completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred,
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
Most of the best books about World War I have worked more often than with complex narratives, such as the First World War and Modern memories - from Paul Fussell or novels as “The West Front of Peace - from Erich Maria Remarquea.
Mr. Englund prefers unconventional concept.
His book has the most crushing ending that he does not like in popular literature.
But I won't tell you.
But you'll feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled a page out of your hand's list of heroes and burned it.
After a previous mistake this time, exactly scheduled for a minute.
She was involved with hundreds of police officers, some of the helmets used in street anxiety.
The night of Monday on Tuesday was chosen because at this time the Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except a few highly built officers, and the others were first told that it was an exercise.
At the head of the event, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
Cases have not been repeated since the last few weeks when, for example, the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators has been breached by the rules of the department and the wave of the sympathy of the public has passed on to the square side.
That is why there was a police operation aimed at cleaning Zucotti's park from demonstrators, only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders have been inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive exercise for behavior in crisis situations took place in Randalls Island, which was prepared for action in Zucotti park.
The leaders have strengthened the so-called training for the repression of anxiety - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of policemen - focusing on the city part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally at the last moment - said someone who was originally explained only as “training” to whom the action was originally explained.
“I know a few police officers who were called into this event, and certainly no one said that he was going to Zucotti Park,” said the person who had spoken only on condition that he would remain anonymous.
“The fact that he was going to Zuccotti Park, he knew only the highest position of the department members,
One reason for undercover was the lesson that the city had already received.
On October 14, the city leaders planned to clean the park, but then they resigned from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they recorded hundreds of them prior to the start of the operation to the park.
Tuesday events were attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of policemen who are commonly used to strengthen the fourth with higher levels of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that he came to the park during the day and left again a large number of people, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
“It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible,” he said.
Before the troops went out, they ranked on Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge bridge, freight vehicles with arched lamps and amplions.
The lights and the recorded news of the amplions scared many demonstrators.
When the group members entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their things and went away.
The police say she didn't touch a single state until 1:45 a.m., so she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park so that they could enter it if there was a need for arrest.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Brown's chief spokesperson said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists feel that the police wanted to stop them from seeing her unit in action, and some police officers behave rough with them.
Mr Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street led along the western border of the park could film without problems.
The police were moving westward, and they had a lot of confusion between personal protesters, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing, followed by teams from the health department, which immediately destroyed everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park, and documenting image materials appeared shortly afterwards on the Internet.
The most annoying group of demonstrators went near the kitchen in their camp, lying near the center of the park.
Some of them created a roadblock, and the police began their methodological arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service members were called to cross locks.
Until 3:30 a.m., there was no arrest in the park, and Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police expressed their statement.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most arrests took place because of the “organisation of endurance and resistance during arrest,” he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of police department, was the top police officer on the scene of the event, the top most unmanned uniform officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the commander of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but he was not involved in the operation management,” said Mr. Brown.
The second group of policemen was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, block north of the park, and on Pine Street, block south of the park, were set up roadblocks.
From these places, the police developed their seatbelts further from Zucotti Park.
In one place, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they pushed people even further outside this border.
There were about 28 people at the northern border.
The wildest event of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., one demonstrant south of Pine Street was spotted, as he jumped onto the hood of a police vehicle, and several others who left the air out of the tire of a police van.
One minute, a piece of the curse flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
A team of help workers will sue the city for release
The Departments representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city at the center. They claim that releases were not necessary and were also discrimination, due to a disproportionate impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court is probably the last option left in their efforts to reverse the release decision to the District Council 37.
On October 7, six hundred and twenty school assistants, parent coordinators and other staff, who were among the highest paid staff of the city. Their releases were described as a payment of the city's department members for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by the work staff through which the city wanted to blind the hole in the budget.
City leaders refused this accusation.
At the meeting of the City Council held last month, Minister of Education said Dennis M. Walcott that the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately held that there was nothing specifically to talk about the release of helpful workers in the budget.
The representatives of the City District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the defendant will be eight of the released workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, the spokesperson of the city's law department, said that the city had not yet seen an action, and that is why it will not speak to each charge.
According to the proposal for a complaint that the New York Times managed to obtain, the unions focused on the amount of people released in the poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their claims on unfair conduct.
They point out that while 17 school assistants lost their school assistants in Staten Island at all and in the Upper East Side section only at least, in Brooklyn, in part District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their work and in part District 8 and 9 in South Bronx were released even 46 assistants.
It recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five of the eight assistants lost their work, although it is about school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The action says: ‘It is not about the neighborhood of full-time parents who can provide funds to balance the deficit in the budget.
Public School 36's budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the bonus funding was calculated for every registered poor student.
Other than others, experts claim that the directors of secondary schools could be confused in a way that was written by a document approving the release of parent coordinators.
In the document, the word “excess” was used to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school payment list to the database of available workers whose wages are played by the central authority.
“Seven six parent coordinators have been released,” says the draft complaint, and not only moved to the database to the position of available workers.
Mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to agree on something about the rebellion in Libya.
However, before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time ruling dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be captured and killed and participated in the United States units.
On Tuesday, the Commission will decide on the international relations of the Senate on observations supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rebellion and US troops to thank for the importance of the European Union.
“This statement we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who began to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
The political aspect of these parties would like to express their support for their democratic efforts.
These sentences may look innocent, but no debate on Libya has yet been easy.
During the summer, the legislators from both sides constantly argued between themselves and the White House on the wording of a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, the refusal of the military roles of the United States in NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorising the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted in the Senate.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the chamber rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
This is what the US mission in Libya literally found itself in the legislative cleansing system - Congress criticized the way President Obama's mission is driving, but his members obviously did not dare to stop supporting him in his beginning.
The commitment of the Congress was finally preceded by another event.
The rebels in August conquered Tripoli and was killed by Kaddafi on 20 October.
Miss Nato officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for international relations in its statement - congratulates the people of Libya for their insignificant courage and admirable tenacity, which they have committed in their efforts to free their people - and - approves men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies involved in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary courage and professionalism -
The statement also confirms the United States’ national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya -
Will a new proposal get full support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be divided again into two half, as was the approval of the June draft?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), Chief Representative of the Republican Party in the Commission stood against the latest version.
Lugar's spokesperson on Monday said the final version of the new proposal has not yet been seen.
This week, the House will vote on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution relating to the budget or other subject to which the whole House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 supplements to the constitution that were presented at the Congress and touched a wide range of various topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted by the House and the Senate - and others are just minor changes to others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the budget balanced allowance and other handfuls, which would like to regulate federal expenditure.
While some of the proposals are identical, their advocates - especially the emerging Republicans, who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their “authorism” -
The revenue for the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required that the amendment relating to the balanced budget be voted in favour of the House and the Senate.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of an optional declaration to support the creation of such an additive.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss and limit the number of periods in which the members of the congress could serve while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be held as president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a wide range of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an addition prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addition prohibiting the burning of the flag state.
Some legislators also want to allow abrogate of federal laws if there are two thirds of states against them.
Although it seems that the members of Congress are very active in designing various supplements, compared to previous years, they do not seem to have a significant effect on average.
At 111 Congress, 77 supplements were offered while the 100th Congress was 66.
Their activity even pale compared to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than contemporary politicians.
The last addition, which was added - 27. Appendix - was ratified in 1992, but actually was proposed by Congress in 1789.
“Perhaps, but not defeated,” says Gifford in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured in the immediate vicinity by a shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on a national television on Monday evening, singing along with melodies from the Broadway show - The Sun Will Come Out Tomrow - and stated that more than returning to Congress is worth getting better.
Giffords appeared on the show -20/20 - at the ABC News station with Diane Savyer. It was seen that she was still making her sentence problems and needed help during the meeting.
The entire show was documenting her difficult reconvalescence, which was necessary due to the injury caused by a bullet that pierced her skull, penetrated her left half of her brain and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to Sněmovna to participate in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview from the ice shooting during which six people were killed and the other 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - with her recovery described as “serious”
When Sayier asked her how she was feeling, she replied to the first-four-year-old Giffords.
A conversation with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly specialise in the show's work -20/20 - which was broadcast in the previous edition of the new book of this couple, entitled \"Gabby: The story of courage and hope.\"
Specially followed the entire reconvalescence of Gifford since the shooting of January 8th.
On the videos Kelly made during the first week, there's a Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the entire forehead.
While her husband is encouraging her, she can't do more than one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in the wheelchair and therapists teach her how to do a simple job.
I'm going to take my head off.
His lips are broken.
And then, her first word, \"What?\"
During a few days, Giffords spoke another word - a toast - when there was a demand for change in her breakfast.
Videos sent by the ABC stations show that the serious role for recovery of GIfords played music: Congresswoman sings on them along with a therapist on tunes to songs -Girls Just Wanna Have Fun - from Cyndi Lauperová and “Free Fallin” - from Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, the Savyers have revealed that she doesn't remember anything from the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said that the Giffords had read the paper on the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who was the six who was killed at the incident.
The shooting is the suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who's being held in Missour Prison, where under the influence of violent medication, he's waiting for trial.
“A lot of people died,” said Giffords Savyer.
- Horrible, terrible, terrible -
Kelly Sayer said that at one point his wife had said during the reconvalescence: ‘I lost’
So I said to her, Gabby, you didn't lose,\" Kelly described.
- You just got loaded.
But you can do it, you can get together, and you'll come back even stronger than you've ever done before.
Military units meet more compassion than with respect
This event was a Wall Street galaxy that took millions of dollars for war vets in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about power, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, flyers and Marines ran by him.
Famously dressed crowd rose up and smothered.
“The men and women serving in the army were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized spring beneficiaries.
In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was also present, but he saw the role of military forces somewhat different.
“All of them were introduced as some orphans,” wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respectable.
So completely opposite impressions are merely illustrated by the uneasy relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrated by the American public.
Voysko is filled with praise for his victims.
But this praise is worth something, they call it soldiers.
The public are increasingly acting as if the individual in uniform felt sorry.
“We are not sacrifices at all,” said Brig-Gen Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way that some of us can support is to put us in the role of unhappy souls.
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who don't want to look ungrateful or show their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face from Vietnam once again was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and in privacy among war veterans.
When two sons of the pensioned Colonel Mark Canciana returned from combat events where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people would look out of the army from two angles for their service.
Some will feel respect and amazing because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
In other words, however, he will drill his head if, under the surface of the evil, violent veteran, said Cancian, who participated in the battles in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government after returning.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who were interviewing him, they suspectedly indicated whether he would be able to resist the stress associated with work in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
“When you talk about your ministry, you have to count on negative reactions,” he taught Cancian his sons.
The unrest of the army, partly, of the American indifference to war.
The failures in the battle field will rarely calm the recognition in the country, which has little awareness of its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there are little self-benefits.
“As a nation we no longer appreciate military heroism as it used to be in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who appointed US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of the men in the gun.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of events that they have suffered, the amount of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure to hit hard against rape
This week, it will decide whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated because of alleged inactivity in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are prepared to file an action.
The first class of Elizabeth Lyman was allegedly raped by her army mate, 25 years old, and she was pregnant at 11.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the casino at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend, she ran into her male friend carrying box with 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her for a little drink in her room.
“In my head a warning light was lit,” Lyman described.
But the native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
No, he's 19.
\"He's from Texas,\" she said.
I wish I could listen to my instincts.
He claims that only a few minutes after they walked into her room, the man went over to her, threw her to bed and raped her.
This week, November 18 will be Lyman and 27 other existing or former military members waiting for the verdict of a hearing that might have a historical impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will go in there to see if the charges against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will get to trial.
The accusation states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charge was given in February by Susan Burke's law and the defendant had 17 members at that time. During the following months, however, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish, and do anything for justice.
Burke says he's going to the neck of the most built army commanders, because the problem is starting with them right now.
\"Armada is a radioactive system,\" he says.
“Who are people who are in a position to avoid the introduction of measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that she contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of which could become part of the other actions brought forward in the future.
Her strategy: rather than to collect all charges into this case - she's putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she'll sue in several different cases, if you need to keep the pressure down.
The defense team is led by the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his coworkers, has given a complaint to reject the case.
The Court of Justice, which has received Newsweek, has been subject to the strategy of defence - in principle, is that current or former soldiers cannot sue for injuries that have suffered as members of armed forces.
According to the Supreme Court of 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries that will put soldiers in active service.
“The injuries in question relate to the military services of the defendants,” says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this issue.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Even though women still cannot officially serve in battle, it is only a word of words: in modern wars they can only be difficult to find clear lines of line.
In the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women's soldiers played a more significant role, especially in communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
As a result, 150 female sex soldiers fell between these wars - two thirds of them directly in combat.
It's time for modernisation in the army to take place, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except for her, she's dealing with three other legal agents.
At Yale Law School, visitors are preparing a veterinary seminar on legal services for the action at four major military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans collects the evidence for their action directed against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of personality abuse, which was allegedly found in the victims of rape, to have an army of excuses for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, belonging to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a completely normal practice.
Its group had already filed an action against the state organisation for dealing with vets, which accused of discrimination practices that were to be brought to the processing of aid applications by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, which was presented by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
In 2010, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported.
However, this type of attacks remain unannounced in most cases and, according to their estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In the report published in March there is also a degree of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010 20 percent of the cases reported in the military - half of which is compared to the civilian justice system.
The applicants in the case of deputy Burke describe attacks only as the first of the entire series of traumas.
For example, Private First Class Lyman reported alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after he was involved.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times as different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She took all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed, from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman's hearing was held before the court during which she was asked questions about whether she loved her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
There were six persons who, as witnesses, spoke about the reputation in favour of an alleged offender who was finally released.
“I remember the day that the judgment was suspended,” Lyman says.
“I felt that I would run out of the courtroom right there in the place of birth - with a scream -
“I was placed on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, it was not his trial. It was mine.”
Lyman's orders to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder in her place, indicating her to be inadvertent to serve.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore even without a claim to service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other applicants move to the next stage or not, it's a long line run, says John Turley, the law professor at George Washington Law University.
Of course, it notes, \"From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the next stages of discussion.\"
Among them, however, there is this doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment of the light of the world.
I myself am a lifetime critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind because their duties do not respect the same degree of motivation and dissuasive resources.
He adds: “Scensions are hard against them... but it is important for them to try.
There will only be a change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoá, the defendant's lawyer, collects hundreds of other persons ready to file an action and starts working on other cases relating to this issue.
“We will not stop fighting the military on this question, where there will be no reform,” he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-EU views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous whitening that remained in Norway 77 dead, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he certainly wasn't lonely in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time with computers, he chatd with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right group on the social networks site.
After this year's tragedy scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy -- just go Facebook.
“We realized that finding them is not really that difficult,” says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of the recent reports of the British research team that concerned European digital populism.
The data of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists have had enough to simply use their advertising on the site and thus with complete accuracy they have determined the search for a demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe, where they focused attention on them and sent ad to them. However, instead of inviting them to the newly created group or offering them some dietary products, they called for them to fill out the questionnaire, where there were questions regarding the level of their education, the relation to violence and optimism due to their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
“It is a completely new way of carrying out research,” Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are all young men who deny a growing rate of immigration.
But, on the other hand, who are also more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain permanently hidden behind the screen of the computer, who are more than those who remain hidden behind the screen of the computer.
The work of the DEMOS team is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends covering the updates of the states, contributions to the walls and pressed buttons - I like them.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users each day. Each of them will provide three different data on average, which makes this social network literally “information supernova”, which stands for the development of many new research. The number of academic work in which the Facebook word appears, increased compared to five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook in giving them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
“It was true that when you wanted to conduct a survey between the British National Party people, it was very difficult to identify them.
“You would have to get to the side where they would never let you go” says Bartlett.
You're just going directly to them.
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify the social and health problems and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more threatened with the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent about this topic.
Morene suggests that the peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too much drunken status.
“The problem cannot be solved if you cannot diagnose it,” said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Dr Moren and the Director of the Centre for Health, Conduct and Development of Children at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
“We have found a way to identify vulnerable children, who otherwise should not have a chance to discover,”
Facebook constantly calibrates the data of its users.
The information team of the website has drawn up statistics on the relationship status and day of St. Valentýna, election participation in 2010 and the national satisfaction coefficient (notably with the information they had access to - the advocates of online freedoms have long said that the website should be made available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility of playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. On-line data are available to everyone.
“In my opinion, most users did not think that scientists could look into their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study conducted by using their students’ public Facebook walls.
“If it was about them, they took it so that information is only between them and their friends.
It is also necessary to consider the question of methodology.
Even in research off-line there is no guarantee that the subject is absolutely honest.
On Facebook there is no way to verify how much information on profile and contributions on the wall is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook is two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
“When you go into the real world and you talk to real people, it’s something that cannot be replaced,” he says.
“Society research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line”
“A cold and inhuman“: Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public court crossing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to seducing two attacks, during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway during his first public court hearing in Oslo himself described himself as a warrior-proofer.
“I am a military commander at the Norwegian resistance movement and among Norwegian Templar Knights,” declared before the trial where 500 people were gathered.
I recognise the objection against the court because the mandate has been given to you organisations that promote the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism.
- I'm familiar with my actions, but I don't plead guilty for them -
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because “he did not want to give Breivík an opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could make his views known. ”
For the same reason, he refused to speak to Breivik, who had brought up a prepared speech with him, at the end of the hearing, to address the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, to prohibit any contact with the media for a period of 4 weeks and to announce that the competent authorities will have complete control over all its visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some have come to hope that they will be able to look into Breivik's eyes, to make sure that he is held firmly under lock.
They all participated to move the case to a close closure.
“It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman,” said the commentator NRK one of the survivors of the attack.
“It was nothing pleasant, but for me I can say that after I saw and heard a suspect, I was mentally moved back a little further.”
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the entire hearing. At the arrival and departure to a building without any trouble of looking for the journalist present and alive in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a larger movement, the judge noted that he was not mad, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any co-workers.
For someone it may be comforting that attacks from June 22 appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
“I wish she to fall out like a monster, but it is not,” said one of the victims.
\"If I did, everything would be much easier--
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie going to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and elected him for his genius with the greatest modern inventor.
At a recently re-discovered Jobs interview, which was written for a special film that is going to cinema this week, Apple will be the fact that his creative mind completely understood business processes and work flows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantian organizer and a person who held every detail in every detail - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer - a pre-requisite that a truly great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] among the excellent idea and excellent resulting product is still a long way of work.
In 1995 Bob Cringely worked on a TV show Triumf of computer madmen, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the film he played a unique, more than an hourly conversation.
At that time, it was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands to work with his new computer company NeXT, and he was patiently looking at how wide the public would accept the Internet.
In the TV show, only a short part of the whole Cringely interview was used and the original copies of the interview were known to have been lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Job's death, however, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly cut, is the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs picture: The lost interview, which is heading into selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has asked for longer conversations, Jobs is surprisingly excited to discuss his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer break between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking about when to see Job’s answer perfectly wonders to be as high and as accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, when Cringely's issues are becoming patient and helps him to get to more important problems and themes more quickly.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod, or iPhone era, and appear in it to be scaryly prophetic thoughts when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the postmortem review of Jobs' careers, but at Jobs, which we see here as a eager dream in the bloom of his genius, there's something raw and inspiring.
He's got his own vision of how things could and should look.
It did not last long, and after speaking his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
The quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
During the years of business, I always asked: Why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's just done--
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking about business things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify Apple accounts.
He was completely confused about the way costs were recorded - often they started with a sign -the default costs - their height could only be thought. At that point he decided to leave his own path - developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs during the moments.
How did he do the rosace on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the “Modro’s box” that Steve Wozniak built - devices that enabled people to hack into a telephone company effectively and call free of charge anywhere in the world.
The device has been written a number of things in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm, when the Blue box describes as an instrument of power, is literally contagious.
They say how they tested with Wozniak devices using a paid phone, and during the call they were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another, while they used as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a dozen times we got this mixed up around the world, so when we yelled at the paid phone, it was a minute later from the second phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and we found ourselves able to set up a thing that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars worldwide.”
The two of us produced a tiny thing that managed to control a much larger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would have ever come without it.
Jobs continues the description of the cake that they had almost reached the end with Wozniak. Throughout the Blue Box in the middle of the night they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, giving their best advice to Henry Kissinger.
The Catholic Church members were gradually called to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the Pope himself woke up before the phone, the double took a look and the headphones lay.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, and he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Not long after their 20 minute interview, Jobs already had a secure summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at that time, and it formed my view of what it was actually such a company and how it was supposed to treat its employees.
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw the first table computer that was ever produced.
He was big as a trunk, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager at HP, I progressed higher and higher, I was hanging around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How it creates innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how they produce new products for running.
In the beginnings of his career, when he went out to sell a few boards with flat connections, one customer asked him to set up a whole computer for him.
There were only 30 days paid, during which he had to invent, to mount even the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he remembers the problems they faced in the development of the computer mouse:
\"I remember the fact that we were having a pretty wild fight... they yelled at me that it would take five years to build a mouse that would cost $300 to stop talking, went out and found a designer.\"
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for 15 USD.
How much of a company is breathful:
Long before he led Apple's resurrection, Jobs spoke clearly that many industrial leaders in their visions would round up and lose their share in the market.
“We say that you work with IBM or Xerox, so you do better copies or printers, and what you do next,
You have monopolies on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At the moment, there's a resuscitation and marketing, so the companies boss people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are trained from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that the company has led to up to its indiscriminate position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
She could've been ten times bigger than she is, could've been Microsoft '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they earned their money on a loss.
How he takes innovation as a form of art:
\"With excellent idea and excellent product, there is still a long journey and a lot of work... and how this great idea develops, so it changes and expands.\"
During that time, you learn a lot about him.
You have to come to a whole range of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do not force you to do it.
You must keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and store them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things ever created by mankind, and in a certain way you try to put them into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and circumstances also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to prove amazing things in all other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Law on Health Care at a time when their case was dealt with by a court
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind the closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question of whether he would take objection to the Law on Health Care of President Obama, two of his Judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by a legal firm who would participate in negotiations before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals put forward.
One of the cases in question was the action raised by 26 states questioning radical reprocessing of medical care approved by Congress last year - a law that mobilised conservative activists throughout the world.
The judges agreed that they would be heard of the action, but in March, there will be 5,5 hours of negotiations, the outcome of which will further develop the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full flow at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court of Justice and try to achieve the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the general prosecutor of the United States under George W. Bush's rule.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federal Society group, which has been dealing with the defence of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which there are huge funds in the process.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after a trial discussion on the subject of the case.
He took part in, among others, including Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republican in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Law on Health Care.
And putting the guests?
It is no new: This pair of judges have been participating in the Group of the Federal Society for years.
And it's certainly not even about anything that would be contrary to ethical rules.
In fact, these judges are released from duty to comply with the principles of conduct that are subject to a lower federal judge.
If, however, they do not, they would definitely fall under principle C4 which says that “the judge may participate in actions that are directly related and other organisations are holding for funding, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorable guest, nor must he be put on the programme of action”
However, the Scali and Thomas relationship to two legal companies operating in the case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in this case, has been rich enough to alert the activists who call for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules as for all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause organization.
“The judges drank and had dinner at the social benefit together with the legal representatives who were waiting to discuss their case before the trial,”
Their presence and assistance in the acquisition of funds through this action undermines the feet with all claims of indiscretion, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed some understanding toward their critics and told them that they were also in a position to combine their judicial obligations with groups such as the Federal Society.
Thomas' wife Ginni is a highly-contained conservative activist.
Moreover, consumers argue that the ethical problem is mainly judged by Elena Kagan and not by Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor under President Obama's rule when the first objections against the law appeared before the court.
The Kagan critics are pushing her to end up taking part in the case, claiming that she fought so much for the law at that time than she could now be unnoticed.
Kagan didn't indicate she was going to quit.
Boeing has received a record contract for electricity aircraft worth $18 billion
Emirates Aerolinkes order 50 dual current aircraft Boeing 777 with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner airliners to Aman Air for which it insulated more than USD 1 billion.
If some company gets a order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if this company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer, and the price of these 50 aeroplanes is a total record $18 billion, it's something else.
The same important news is where Boeing obtained the contract: the Middle East, an increasing gold mine for future orders of aircraft.
According to forecasts issued on Monday, the Chicago Company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2 520 aircraft worth USD 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history for commercial aircraft - 50 dual current Boeings 777.
The sensational order came from the Emirates airline located in Dubai.
The Boeing company at the 2011 Dubai Air Show said that airlines have the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which would make the total value of the contract amounted to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is proud of the better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aeroplanes exceeds USD 1 billion.
“One excellent report for the entire Boeing company,” said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
The quality of these specific customers is very high.
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to those countries that are holding oil.
This means that they do not only have money to pay aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its largest costs - it is not so critical, because the country alone makes oil prices higher.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines, that they could increase or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
\"They have natural protection,\" he says.
The United Arab Emirates contract strengthens Boeing’s leading position on the market with a large hull and brings to narrow Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s Dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus's representatives announced that the first flight of their largest aircraft A350, which is a direct competitor of the aircraft 777,300ER.
The removal took place because the customers demanded more useful aircraft load and up to now, so the manufacturer took time to deliver more engine power.
The price of Boeing Co shares increased by 1.5% to $ 67.94.
Apparently, the Mexican president's sister was defeated in the michoacan elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, helped with the governor's chair of drug trafficking.
She seems to have lost her sister Felipe Calderon in violent state elections to the governor's post in Michigan. On Monday, she later declared that one of her opponents helped to win the drug traffickers.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the governorial elections of the Western State of Faust Vallej by the Instituteal Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The coverage of organised crime members to the whole election process, and especially until yesterday’s election itself, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” said Luis Maria Calderon in an interview for radio the day after Sunday elections.
\"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion survey group... they were electoral, building roadblocks... and letting people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the Presidency.
However, he plans a short return to power and victory in the elections in Michigan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes it will win even in July in the presidential elections.
It seems Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led only very close one day before the elections.
Calderon, the candidate for the conservative side of her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused Vallemon to accept as a winner.
The third was placed by Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-hand side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which until now controlled the Governor's Office. For the debated and proudly persecuted side, it is before the Presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state, named Morelia, refuse any relationship with drug traffickers and urges other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacane has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the birthplace of President Calderon and just in Michoacán in December 2006 he began a military fight against criminals.
However, violence has persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, Luisy Marie Calderon's Stoupenary, was murdered only one week before the elections and many candidates of the election have resigned from fear.
However, however, the results of the election in Michigan look for the side of PRI however, the victory of the side will help get a new impulsion.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington Vallej, congratulated and said: ‘I think this victory would be very encouraging due to the coming year’
Bank ADB calls Asia to help save Eurozone
Bank Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help rescue the Eurozone before its severe debt crisis, otherwise it could result in a global economic decline that would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Naga, Director General of Bank ADB, based in Manile, said that two of the fastest growing economies in the world have to do everything in their power to help rapidly recover the monetary block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned against the fact that the Bric countries [Bresale, Russia, India, China] all European difficulties are not too excited - and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and resources will help to bless the long-term collapse of the global economy.
- We're all in this together -
\"So everyone who could help Europe from the crisis is fit,\" said the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asie may be protected to some extent, but she is certainly not immune.
\"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it.\"
The European Monetary Association has been closely tested by a severe debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, the loan costs of Italy have increased dangerously and the Presidents of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could again withdraw to recession, and the call began to bring about new emerging front economies to join and help the Eurozone to find solutions.
Mr Naga foretold that all Asian aid would be directed through the IMF, but he noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds by the Fund of financial assistance to the European Union, the institution for European financial stability - would give Asian partners more negotiating options to European countries.
Anand Sharpa, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that “India will do what she can,” to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in export and a dry flow of foreign capital.
“Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We are facing a difficult task, and we must maintain a high level of growth -
“It is not an alternative, it is a fine fact, because as otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women,
Others argue that emerging economies such as the Indian ones have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the USA said it would be politically difficult to explain the aid to Europe 1.2 billion inhabitants of India when 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less per day.
“One might find that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy holidays on the beaches, which might be difficult to explain,” he noted.
Lee Howell, the Director-General of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well paid employment to many Greek citizens in badly managed and loss sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis was at risk of a dangerous dominant effect -
The bank's prediction that Asia will take place between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of economic growth is now facing a \"risk of decline\" because of European threats.
He declared that vulnerable emerging markets had to create ‘unforeseeable expenditure plans’ to be protected from the decline and significant outflow of capital from their economy.
Warning from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
On Monday, the Minister of Defense, Leon Pantta, added well under the boiler when he warned that the restrictive automatic cuts in the budget could jeopardise national security and trigger a financial chain response to the Pentagon and continuing through the battle site in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion reduction in the next ten years, but now it is concerned that the Congress will not conclude an agreement on expenditure.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,” wrote Pantta in a letter from Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach the budget agreement and thus the so-called suspension will result in a 23% flat-rate decline and stopping many new projects.
“With such a huge reduction in this inseparable way, most of our construction or ship projects will not be possible - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or ships. Moreover, it could be seriously damaged by further modernisation efforts,” wrote Pantta Senators.
“We will continue to be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since it is to reduce so quickly, we will also have to send the civilians to a forced holiday so that we can meet the target requirements.”
“These changes can shake with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously harm its preparedness.”
Finally, the cuts will touch the battle troops, and Pantta has announced.
Even though the accounts for financing possible war operations in overseas will not directly affect this establishment, there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets, the Pantta warned.
“There will be cuts in the contractual staff, resulting in the delay of the contractual contracts supporting the war efforts of our people,
‘The conditions of paid staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and subsequent infringements of legal and political support;
Both Senators of Panette wrote down ten days ago and asked for details about possible impacts on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defense.
The results of the service at the Ministry of Defence could lead to rapid degradation of the view of the United States as world military power.
“We are strictly opposed to this harsh measure,” said Senators in their joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panette’s letter.
“It is not a conclusion that we can live with, and we certainly do not want to sign under it.
“The cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow -
“It will be seen first if Panette’s letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the Pentagon to leave the list of affected areas.
Pantta has recently been more open in interviews about possible cuts, although he himself has gone to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a rigid fight.
At the press conference held a minute week, the Minister of Defense indicated a brief picture of what his department might expect - the shell of the army, inside which the core will be missing.
- He'll be as a boat without seamen -
- He'll be like a brigade without ammunition -
- He'll be an air force without trained pilots -
“It will be like a paper tiger, as an army of casars, buildings and bombs without sufficient training to complete the mission,” said Pantta at the beginning of the speech in the Pentagon.
“It will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with the possible enemy.
As a result, aggressiveness will be welcomed.
In the Annex supplied with a letter by McCain and Graham Pantta specify how it will reduce the operating risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of privileges and deployment across the world; anticipated unacceptable risks in future combat operations -
In addition, the Lord added that some of the greatest defence projects could wait for termination, including those already tested, even those which are only in the early phases of planning.
On the list, for example, the project of an aircraft F35, a planned new bomber, a balist submarine of the new generation, a new coastal battleship and a new ground battle vehicle that the army and the Marine Corps wanted to replace the lobster.
During the next decade, USD 80 billion would be saved by stopping further development and testing of the F35 aircraft, but its supporters claim that it is a necessary step in improving the military that needs to be tackled by the countries with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
The summer view of recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and permissive lies and lying in everyday life.
The Republican President's candidate Herman Cain has full hands on the charge that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim that the other one is lying.
Officers at Penn State University were accused of being convicted of perjury when they tried to hide records of the fact that a trained football coach sexually attacked a boy.
Last week, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught up with an abandoned microphone called US President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy the entire careers and attract the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately exposed to unquestionable evidence.
John Edwards' former presidential candidate was accused of abuseing money from his campaign to try to conceal his unmarriage relationship.
And no one ever forgets a media circus that got around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky.
It's all about cheating at school and university.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers only to look good in their opinions.
Men who should teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show you're lying between 10 and 200 cases on one day.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in life.
The definition of lies, or the recognition of lies, is an essential skill that anyone should adopt, whether for personal or working reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, the way a person screams: \"I have you--The understanding of a fool is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths of lies have been torn out.
The liars are still looking in your eyes.
It's not like they'd be smothering, watching, shaking or getting mad.
Of course, do not think of it being difficult to spot and expose a liar.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from wind construction, small terms in the face, the way questions and their timing are formed.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a vast and developing sector relating to the recognition of lies and it is clear that the discovery of the lie is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today's difficult world can help you very much - especially if your duties are to hire, arrange interviews, negotiate or lead people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them bow in security, guide their emotions and intuitably realize how the other side receives them.
From research, we know that extroverti lies more often than introverti that men rent more “sebed” lies, while women say more lies, mostly because of protecting someone’s feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (all lies they say, mostly being “inheritious”--
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
Watch the subject's normal behavior first.
This is called ‘start observation’
He will make it possible to find out what to compare it to.
Notice the possession of the body, its laughter, the work with the voice.
You should know if someone normally constantly knocks their legs so that you don't properly blame him for lying just because the middle of the meeting starts to knock their feet.
Then try to determine the depths of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But consider it only as warning signals, not as evidence of lies.
People who lie can stop moving the upper half body when they try to remember their invented story, the tip of the shoe can shoot to the door, reach the east, significantly change the holding of the body or show the relief after the interview - overflowed relief and change the position when it is difficult to answer them.
People interviewing frequently give a false signal that it's an interview at the end just so they can see what a relief it will look like after it ends.
Also see the language of the entity.
Famous is the story of Scott Peterson's once overturned and used last time when he claimed that his murdered woman was alive, which ran a national search on her body.
The glamorous individuals may also express themselves in proportion: ‘I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Levinska - or the difficult question are repeating the whole thing.
The most common verbal characters are only very tiny.
Someone can use a lot of “smoving tongue” when he answers the difficult question:“Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge -
We don't get to know too much in this response, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal any lie, but it is possible to master the skills through which a lie can be hatched.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not flying a liar and a fraud in his personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delaying the approval by the US Government
A few days after Obama’s government threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipe from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus sending its unions against each other, but calmed down the environmentalist - the company having the construction of the pipe to the mayor announced that it was willing to re-direct the project so that things could be moved again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned route of pipelines from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the seat of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada Alex Purbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead to another route.
This notice came after the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week declared that it postpones a decision on a federal permit for a project from which it will not conduct a study of possible replacement routes, which would not be possible to hit the area of Sandhills in Nebrasca and the water layers of Ogalla, a large underground water supply plant.
“This is really a shift forward,” said the Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebrasky for Fox News.
The new environmental judgment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have removed any decision until 2013, i.e. a year after the elections in the next year, but the authorities refuse to play a role in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support to him.
1 700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Albert's province to the refinery in Texas, I eat 700 000 barrels of oil daily.
This road will have to be over six states.
This project totally hates environmentaries, but they love him working numbers, which estimate that there are 20,000 new jobs when working on a pipe.
However, the legislators in Nebrasca stood up against this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to hit Sand Hills and to the water layer Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and watering.
The current study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but the energy industry source said that the general inspector from the Ministry had ordered a new review of the process of the original study and focused mainly on two questions.
One time it was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not present a conflict of interest in the program.
Further, whether the company that was hired to the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being afraid of the bat.
The New York family claims that Patti LaBelle's singer must have thrown into their manhattan home's vest and scared their daughter out of fear.
The appearance of the singers to the title “Lady Marmalade” scared the 18th-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered the change of personality, sleep disorder, and the increased fear of strangers,” says her family in the action brought to Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10th, last year, Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a school teacher, and Genevieve was on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk set up a car, Roseanna Monk met her luggage down into the lobby of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and was carrying with her and Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a while and took off her baby for a while.
“Someone appeared behind my back and said: ‘You know what your daughter does,” I said, yes, and I went to pick her up.
LaBell's pregnant wife has been intimidated.
“You should not put your daughter at the door,” said Roseanna Monk.
\"I said to her, \"I don't care about your opinion.\"
She got angry and started talking dirty - loudly she shouted the simplest terms...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started making water out of me.
He says Genevieve got a hysterical seizure.
“I told that woman: “Look at what you did to my daughter,” said the mother of the child.
LaBelle was on her mother's arms, which still had Genevieve - he threw and had to stop her until her date, which then dragged her to the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, her daughter screamed so much when she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but they did not get any answers.
The lawyer and spokesperson LaBelle will not respond to our calls to express themselves to the whole case.
The appeal requires an undisputed compensation, but a family attorney, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family planned all the money to pay the charity organization to children with cancer.
“The task is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her beginning,” said Davis.
“This behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month child in his arms--
Climate abuse has deteriorated the economy
During the first year of the reign of Maria Lópeze Valdez, unemployment and restlessness increased in Sinaloa, the foreign investment fell and the economy
The year 2011 is signed into the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the Government of Maria Lópeze Valdez, called the Government of Change. This government brought great expectations with it as regards economic progress, but due to adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year there was no growth and there was even a decline in major economic development indicators.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the growth opportunities of the state economy, had a conscience to reduce economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In agriculture, there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and partial damage was found on the remaining 21.07%.
The decline in economic activity up to November resulted in a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased to 5,28% during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 inhabitants of the Sinaloa state, representing an unemployment rate of 4,53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment grew to 5,28% and average unemployment continued to grow between July and August and reached 6,19%, representing approximately 74 000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lópeze Cervantes, the Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, a possible rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by means of steps carried out at the level of public policy.
“We are witnessing an increasing unemployment that is related to different factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to the reduction of resources as a result of legislation approved by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally raise money, it is not easy to earn them, invest them or use them for something,” he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes stated that demographic factor is also involved in the rise in unemployment.
“The number of people who go abroad, to the United States, has decreased, but because of an inadvertent entry, and then because even though these people abroad get to work, it is difficult for them to get to work, so people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment grows,” he said.
Inadequacy
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsened due to increasing incompetence that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the people employed in the state are working without paying the benefits of social security management.
Other features of the labour market such as low wages are added to unemployment and indifference. In this administrative territory there are lowest wages from all over the country, as the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetat, deep below the national average, which moves to 7,375 peseta.
Shortening of direct foreign investment
With the decline in economic activity and unemployment in 2011, the most significant decline in direct foreign investment over the last 10 years was recorded. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, direct foreign investments amounted to $630 697, which represents a decrease of $87.74% compared to the amount of $5 143 312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State states investments of 17 280 million peseta per year.
Debt
In the light of the scenario of the decline in the economy, the government asked the state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to restore the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of government Maria Lópeze Valdése pointed to the lack of governance control.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transforming Industry, stated that in 2011 there was no matching of the will of the different sectors, including the government itself.
\"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been truly insignificant during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we have lost in this year. In 2012, we need to double our efforts, lack of harmonisation of efforts to all of us and especially the right and synchronized functioning of this new government.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López stated that events like freezing at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not fully recover, so that it could again create dynamics that would allow a acceptable level of process, products and services to be achieved, and therefore we were deeply below expected forecasts at the end of the year - said.
Redefined mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriart, the president of the Mexican Confederation in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
We believe that a long-term plan should be drawn up in which the objectives and economic direction of the state would be redefined, since it is important to mobilise all potential material and human resources that Sinaloa has, he said.
Work that's ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the vision of the future, which would be better guided by government efforts.
“I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has taken place in the field of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan,” he said.
He pointed out that the current administration showed progress regarding public policy direction.
“There are elements that allow the government to claim that the government is trying to be attractive. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work before us.”
Sold for 8 kg marijuana
The callee was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for holding eight kil marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuele Sandoval. He was tried for the crime of health threats, specifically for the holding of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Valenzuela Sandoval was held by the Mexican Army files on 7 June 2010 at the meeting in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the station 80 in El Castillo District, Called.
Dealler was driving a pick up white colors in the van. He had a black bag in his car and a small bag in the seat. The soldiers found 8 kilos of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the man in charge remained the Judges of the second department and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the implementation of the legal consequences of criminal offences.
Support expenditure for projects
Social projects, which are part of the programmes such as Hábitat, State Security and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be caught until the end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development stated that, if construction work has gone forward so far, it is now at risk that the government will not be able to provide adequate supplies that require more than 11 million resources per three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until this time, only the Federation and the City, so it is possible that the project will be delayed.
“We have no choice but to secure nearly 12 million, and although the year is already due, we have received nothing at all. Even though we have already had a part in July,” he said. “To make sure that we do not waste time, we have started the projects and continue very apparently, but we lack money.”
He said that in the last year, Jesúse Aguilara Padilla did not fulfil the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan to cover more than 7 million which did not give them state administration.
“The state had no economic capacity to participate and programs to continue. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to obtain resources that would cover what did not end the state,” he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise from the state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that the request of Armand Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance was sent to the Secretary of Administration, to improve the management and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
“They were supposed to give us 12 million, although the year was close to the end, we have not received a dog yet.”
The Court of Justice approves, in Mexico, the end of the analogue broadcast in 2015
The replacement of digital analogue signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action put forward by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wanted to succeed in the so-called ‘response of analogue signals’, and implemented it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, thought that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree in which the individual steps that led to the transition to the earthly digital television.
This result was rejected by the action brought by the Senate, because the qualified majority of eight votes needed to be heard by the court to express itself on the constitutionality or inadequacy of the said decree, which so remains valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero provides for the possibility of declaring a decree for failure, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by the Federal Committee for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in order to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of decrees and all actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action filed by the Chamber of Messengers without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not refer to the arguments of the proposal in that sense that the federal exectiva cannot structure through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
\"I do not think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority - and recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector would be equivalent to a federal ex-ante which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of digital analogue signals is one of the world's biggest changes in recent years. It is related to better use of radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is thought that delaying the change would mean giving rise to the benefits of digitisation, which requires a decision on public interest. There is not only a technical dimension for digitisation but also for economic, social, political and national security issues.
As pointed out, these questions require the operation of the whole system in place, in line with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences which the Constitution trusts in the hands of the Government of the State,
He reminded that many countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they have had highly specialised technical authorities.
He pointed out that it was not possible for the government to issue an uncontested decree that would in some extent interfere with the competence of the congress to introduce in the area of administration compliance with the laws of the legislative powers prepared.
In Michigan, they analyse the possibility of counting, voice-to-voting,
According to data published PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, so far 879 votes from 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of counting - vote - appeared in this year's elections in Michigan, where in line with the data published by the Preliminary electoral Results Programme (PREP) there is a difference between the first and second place in the governor's election of less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been started with the 879 votes of the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Voleb Institute in Michigan (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that several days ago, 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal election reform.
As it will be recalled, Michigan has officially not confirmed its political constitution or its State Election Code or the Act on Election Justice. The State Congress has approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this parliamentary period and Governor Leon Godoy Rangel has given up their publication within the time limit set in the Act of the Official State Journal, with some objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the voice of the head of the State in the matter of constitutional reforms for the “free and illegal”, because it has no right to approve, nor to impose,
On the question of the possibility of calculating the vote, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures, the IEM General Council will be able to implement the local election body in part and overall.
In this way, a partial calculation of votes, one or more electoral packages will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no entry on the number of votes and calculations in the relevant box or does not have it available; or if errors and obvious infringements of the electoral results have occurred.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all electoral languages will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential election winner and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the sitting there is a express request by the representative of the Party and/or the coalition which proposed the candidate in the second place.
The total conversion of votes will also be possible when, after proper reading, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is a explicit request by the political party whose candidate has ended in the second place. In such a case, the election packages for which a partial calculation was made will be removed.
It should be noted that there is a choice in Morelia where there is a difference between the first and the second place of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinam mountains, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported Sunday night to Saltillo, his home town. During Monday, the ceremony and the ostrich Mass will take place.
According to the family, it was the last wish that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinam Mountains.
After they died in an accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuil on board the Mexican air force. Family and closest friends attended the Campo Marte ceremony.

According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, “it was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family. ”
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined Colegio del Aire, Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove the vest, but he always followed his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, “sotva came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo”
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán for the promotion of his uncle, so he's convinced that he died in his life as he liked: plane driving.
They gave him the last good-bye.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we have said goodbye to all the honours that came to him to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican air force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he stood out both in the studio and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after he fell down the helicopter he was driving. He was also on board the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and other six others, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remnants of the Salallen family Bacio Cortése arrived to be passed through the funeral service by means of the Mexican air force under the direction of Major Jaime Martinez in the prostranition, where the family, his daughter Amanda and the wife of Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the Cadereyta NL ship.
Several hours before the military officials found, 11 people were arrested in this area for crimes associated with organised crime.
The body of three men murdered by shooting into various parts of the body and head was found on the abandoned ship of the Cadleyta Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
It occurred at a distance of 1.5 miles from Cadereyta to Santiago, on the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with the beige-wax fence had been open from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three meters away, they noticed three bodies, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person had a sports shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not a shoe. Next to it, there was also a man lying in a sports shirt with white rods.
A few meters further there were bodies of other people dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were facing the ground.
According to the data obtained in the locations, all three people were probably murdered in a different location because no bullets were found.
On the chat fence were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime of the other and a number of bullet tracks, both on the construction and on the doors.
There were 11 suspects in Cadereyta.
The National Defence Secretary presented 11 persons among whom there were also youths who were members of a criminal group operating mainly in the area of Cadreyt and associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published at the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 people were arrested and one person was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called ‘Los Zetas’
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6 pm. Military personnel were at a meeting in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, when they noticed cars without the SPZ and two people.
After stopping the car, they took a tour and discovered one rifle, a casing, and 18 bullets.
Then, based on these statements, one of the Allies in La Frauda were held on 13 November around 14 hours. When he saw soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of GeneralTran, China and Cadereyt.
On Wednesday the new Italian Government will be appointed
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that this country holds over the breach of economic disasters.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present a new government that will face the crisis that this country holds over the breach of the economic disaster and which has put the whole euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report in which he announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could create a government.
It is expected that they will introduce a government composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti stated that he would present the results of his interviews with political parties in an attempt to create a government.
\"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase,\" said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to create a government, but his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
“The frame is now well marked,” he added.
Monti completed the process of creating governments for less than three days, i.e. in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, which has reached an unsustainable level of debt.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim must approve a tough package of austerity measures that require European leaders.
There is a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry, because of the instability of the markets, they exceeded the interest of the Italian bonds BTP with a 10-year maturity of 7 percent, the level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.
Emma Marcegalia, chairman of the Italian employer organization Confindustria, told journalists after the meeting with Montim: “We said that we would support this government very much”
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this palpable situation.
Monti's hope of success has been significantly multiplied thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis forced on Saturday to resign.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are predestined for good results,” said the journalists Angelina Alfano, the mystery of the midway party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant, because until now, a number of its members stood against the government with the technocratic majority that Monti is drawing up.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament so that it can promote unpopular savings reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could create a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti launched negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, which allowed a very rapid process to respond to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi gave the demission, the interest of Italian bonds returned to the critical border and reacted to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
To save Italy, with a public debt of 1,8 trillion euro, it would be beyond the possibilities of current euro area financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should hold with power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecasts that the politicians claim to give him time only to implement the reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include policies in his cabin, but the large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of trouble for the countries to reach because of financial pressure.
Political resources have stated that bilateral distrust and distrust between the parties have made efforts to include both government and political personality.
Spanish participates in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of 22 Spanish football players, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of 22 called players has reached number 50 matches.
Huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica, if we compare 22 players of both countries who met today at a friendly game in 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While masters of the world and Europe, the number one monthly FIFA rating, they have a wide range of A class interbreading games, Costa Rica has only the defender of Michael Uman who has played 50 international matches as the only one.
This number reached last Friday at the match against Panama ****) at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Love Stars and in the power clubs of the English first league over a year maintain an intensive activity on league champions and home cups and high level play in European Cups as Champions League.
We also need to add to the previous experience from the national Spanish team in the complicated settlement matches at the European and world championship.
The Costa Rica players have, on the contrary, very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, a Concacaf that is considered to be the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign games from Spanish representation has on its side goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who took place in England last Saturday (prohra 0-1 in London) on the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international games.
Casillas will also come up against Costa Rica today and will get a new record for Spain - 127 international play.
Xavi Hernández, a key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches at its end.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by the UFA together with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their end. Among them the already mentioned Zubizarret is 126 and the Central Attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The sheep also approached the Carles Puyol with the 97 matches.
The following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Uman are moving left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz is 45.
In addition, only 5 played the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 games in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Castorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica the Bolívar has only one and Ojlman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
The Costa Rica side has the most intervention of Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Kvinteto included the country in his tour on the occasion of a celebration of twenty years of existence
“Cesta in Costa Rica is a dream that happens to be real -
In an exclusive interview for Viv, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the band is ready next Sunday to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the possibility to play at Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That's what the bassist and the founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viv last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent within the tour on the occasion of celebrating twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20. it will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will take place from 19:30 to the National Stadium along with the angelic group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of an interview that you can find the whole transcript on La Nación's website.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans enjoy?
The trip to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes real.
In South and Central America, we were barely the second time and experience has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can spend a few days here.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I'm asking because they literally love the group here, fans are having these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most beautiful supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so long.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that cause more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've presented in the past 21 years have been created in a few weeks horizon.
We had some great shows at Sao Paulo, and we hope that we got into form for a concert at Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love serving, we like jungles, for both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends drive surf at Costa Rica or to Nicorauy or Mexico. These are the best places to surf, so we've learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
Let's try to show the best show with various compositions, try to play some songs from every album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoar.
You never repeat the repertoár.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked it so much and that we might have forgotten it already.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
You celebrate this tour for 20 years of art course.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and we realize that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to have a look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't get better.
What meant to you that you were a major part of the formation of the grubbe genre?
It was always an honor for us that we could be part of this group in which they were represented by the great ones themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to arise from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some more.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that was created in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and have the same members after all these years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think we're all lucky at first that we're still in this world, and secondly, our role is played by the fact that we're constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and we have managed to open musical ways that leave everyone free to experiment.
We believe in each other, we appreciate the music of others, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.
We're trying not to go too far on tour because it's very easy to fall into this crowd trap and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came because of music, you will remember that you must have music and what you gave her, respect her. You must not be kidnapped by being famous, rock stars.
How do you remember another project named Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something magnificent.
We existed as a band for three years and we never released any albums after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
The most important thing is that we're friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was how I laughed at him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and many others.
It was an incredible person, and we miss him very much.
The National Team Las Robertas will be tasked to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as a surprise?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore we wonder what Las Robertas will offer for life and must be very fun.
Why do you always live to change the words of Yellow Ledbetter?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding the first to him.
Who affects you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
I was first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about bassists all night I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to hold the grunge, even though she is no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt an easy separation from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if this music is still valid today, it's something great because it's music worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that there are some songs in the new album, which are easier to handle, but also there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered to be very glamorous, although they may sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're very dark songs.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose one of your family or boyfriends, these things start to affect your art and music and these two songs for me that's what they represent.
I also think that you can be a happy person, and yet you can make a gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss suffered in the field of lower limbs, informed his nurse.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving the penalty of 25 years of depriving freedom for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancers, which have been operated four times and already have doctors under control.
Member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, said the Canal N television station that Fujimori will conduct tests within three days at the National Institute of Nonplastic Diseases where they should find out why he hurts him and why he loses his strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that, in his view, Fujimori could get grace for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
It was four times due to the cancer of the tongue, it dropped 18 kilograms, and another neutrophils were added to these problems, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst on the saliva, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, named the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving punishment since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed the murdering evasor of troops acting illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica's visit to Mexico, which aims to strengthen political ties
The official delegation chaired by the Hungarian President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, launches a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón. It is the most important meeting of extensive visits to the full meeting with the representatives of the political, trade and representatives of the western community living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on the political issues between the two countries, published the western Presidential Office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In Sarkozy’s speech, he threatened that the countries which continue to remain in the position of tax havens will be excluded from the international community. This declaration has led to a rejecting opinion by Uruguay and to consult the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November. The G20 has been a group composed of the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has sought specificisation of fiscal exchange agreements with a view to reaching out of the Black Charter, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries which have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From the commercial perspective of Mexico and Uruguay, since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been concluded, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded installer is running in 3D thanks to the Super Mario 3D Land -
Super Mario has been struggling tireless for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the Bowser’s clutches, but he has never appeared in 3D: in “Super Mario 3D Land”, he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month to all stores around the world has been since the beginning to use all the characteristics that offer a portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
“Mario is a character that has to say how to work stereoscope without glasses,” said a press officer working on Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of video games in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that: Super Mario 3D Land is the first Nintendo video created specifically for this carrier, since up to this moment successful images such as Star Fox 64 3D - or -Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D were adaptation of already existing titles.
In addition to the 3D image, the Nintendo spokesperson stated that the Super Mario 3D Land is an accessible video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth party.
Alvarez confirmed that: Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is “a simple one, whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can start in the second round at the levels of the game that are more difficult this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between the “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and to avoid optimizing failures.
This new launch of Super Maria in 3D also foresees the return of character to a portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video heating Nintendo plays notes to those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous parts. It expects that the installer of the bearded man will have to pass through dangerous dominated platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movement, around, in disguises as well as among enemies, he will also appear “playful - Luigi.
Colom approved Portilla's release to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he took steps in the issue of former President Alfons Portilla, who was to answer the conspiracy in the United States for the purpose of money laundering $70 million.
This ends the process, which was intended for Guatemala to respond at the request of the northern country required by Portilla to judge it.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive authority and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the release.
He ensured that he did not interfere with the judicial decisions during his mandate and allowed all the editions that had been given to him on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for the murder and severe harm to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's step is a step in exequence after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead a process against the former President who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of an apology of 120 million at the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency, but this process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed and returned the case to the game.
Triniov helped 6,000 young people in danger
The organization was established to help children without education to avoid being found at the edge of society.
The first 25 years of social support organisation Triniov is very important: 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion have been helped. The organisation has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this end, a long hundred jobs have to be allocated to this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a balance in the framework of the solemn act, which took place in the former factory premises of Fabra and Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
Triniov was established in Trinity Vella in 1986 in order to help young people with low education, no work, no drug addiction, or a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions that have worked with the association in the past 25 years took part in the meeting in Sant Andreu.
A diverse political representation, at the time of elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Triniov.
Together with President Generalitat, Artur Masem, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the festivities of the official act by former Socialist Councillor Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayors and current environmental and socialist Council of Ricard Goma.
In the Grand Hall of Fabra and Coats, present advisers for Social Benefit and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and general director of social work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
The mass said that Triniov was created in a very difficult time and that today’s time also makes a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is a good foundation.
The President said Triniov as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and to add courage to people in difficult situations.
“Krize is not for this organization and for the work he does, nothing new,” he said.
There was an evicted house where giant parties were hosted
The aliens took 11 out of 13 apartments in the Balmes building, 51
12 ransommen left the house last night at noon without resisting
All of them testify that the nightmare that the neighbors used from number 51 on Balmes street is finally over.
Twelve people had voluntarily left a building that had been illegally occupied and organized by giant parties that had been building neighbors yesterday at noon, leaving the building out of the court order without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock was replaced on the doors to prevent the repetition of the situation.
“From this moment on, the entrance will be guarded,” said the administrator.
The ransommen who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the remaining are inhabited - they took all electrical and partly water equipment, and also painted walls and left all kinds of waste, especially cans after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and awakened other tenants.
Next to the building is disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that for the time when the building was occupied, the sales decreased by 80%.
The disco owner emphasises that the shopkeepers of the building made it a small competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while it costs 10 on the disco.
In addition, the entertainment company owner had to respond to the claimants of the neighbors because of noise, but the problems were not caused by visitors to the discos, but the residents of the taken house, and especially those who participated here with organised parties whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the surrounding area.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she forgives her rent.
The City Police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from their neighbours over the last weeks.
President of the City Group of the People's Party of the Polish Party on the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested that the building be immediately evicted and put to an end with the problems of civil use that are suffering from neighbours and the destruction of the area,
The President of the People explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in recent months, the ransommen have been given all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there was even theft.
In this respect, he added that it needed to end up with impunity and to be consistent with the actions against civil responsibility in the building -
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after they called her neighbors who saw her entering four people's building.
All four of them were held immediately.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of a hearing which carries more than a lesson about honoraries
The city selection procedure for 16 gates opens again a debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the largest bloom, the stagnant Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the same self-printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the main border of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that do not focus on the north - south, but up (hora) - down (sea).
Collserole qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The report was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the savages instead of the bear Yogi.
Such a position was until September when the city hall declared a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserol.
The gate, of course, records rather the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to place the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organisational, and on the basis of a reflection on the city, this question becomes a central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It's already the same theme as when two members of this old caste chosen to meet in the elevator give their hand.
And that is exactly what caused one of the rare differences between three Barcelona architects and the predominant university professors.
Miguel Rollan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayon: The selection procedure has its reasons.
According to Rollan, after the question of the Gulf Party has been raised, it is necessary to discuss the ‘horan side’, so the Ildefons Cerd's speech about green apples was not brought to the end.
We must be based on the principle that the beach is the most widest Barcelona park.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex - declared an architect for which the name ‘brány do Collserola’ holds a ‘lexicological trap’: we must not imagine them as entrances to the park but rather as the definition of the zone where it is possible to operate.
Modol, as well as Rollan and Bayon’s experience in the urban world, qualifications the proposal as a “intelectual challenge - which raises some dangers“
Risks resulting from the “notice that today represents a project of public places, after the experience of the 1980s, which had been singing in the Forum-Shoulding area,
The first concern is the definition of the border itself, where it should be built.
“There is something to define that is to take a further step,” it is essentially moving forward.
The new urban and planning tools need to be remembered, as the current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (optional)) can cause a real disaster.
If we focus more specifically on the question, Modol believes that the bottom-up slopes of Collserola can be considered as a park - but a part of Barcelona, not for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also pointed out that there is already a work that Patronat de Collserola has done, which, although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its game that it will reach the project from the first moment,
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountains and cities is a kind of a pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but - doubts - that it should be just this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams - it adds all about the skills - it adds), which should be created:‘Architectitis should be only instruments’
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complicated, because there is no global vision of Collserola in the selection documents: “There is 16 selection procedures that address all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole -
This causes at least him to enter all 16 selection procedures.
In other words, the project of one gate may affect the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the whole length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino excused Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released.
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal Agent Cadino Red granted mercy to his brother, Mayor Monterrey, in a process in which he was prosecuted for the alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal Agent Casino Red granted his grace before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which discussed the case of blackmail, in which the brother of Mayor Monterrey was accused.
After the asset at Casino Royale owner Casina Red, Sergio Gil García published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas had asked him to pay the economic quota to allow the city hall in Monterrey to allow illegal operations in the betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Attorney's prosecution began the criminal prosecution of the brother of the Panist Mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agency, number 3 for property offences was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital city of the state.
The following 49 days remained in this position after the second arrest regulation was put out, and the Public Ministry Agency gave up the opportunity to participate or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta for suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casin Red with one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in a prison with moderate control because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the San Nicolás de los Garza in the process.
On October 25, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who declared that there was enough evidence to prove Jonas guilty of the investigation, for example, the payment of the amount of 1,5 million peso to the casino representative in exchange for the promise that the operation would be possible.
On Monday, the legal Agent Casina Red, Bishop Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage were corrected and who decided to grant mercy.
On the basis of the official file of 197/2011, legal grace is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. In a process against him, there will be no complaint. It is also impossible to request compensation for damage or punishment.
After crossing with a law enforcement officer around 15:50, the court ordered immediate release of Larrazábal Bretona.
The mystery of the court, Jorge Yanez, was put in a prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that she was granted an official grace and his case was cast into the archives.
He also announced that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Diónisio Pérez Jacome presented details of the air accident that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and other seven others.
The secretariat for communication and transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation that killed the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and the other seven people show that the helicopter fell directly on the ground full of force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the Dionisio Pérez Jacome press conference, the Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that the pilot had concluded that air conditions allowed prior to the launch of the aircraft.
The numbers that appear indicate that the unit has come to contact the terrain several times, the wings have entered the tree branch 25 meters from the place where the unit has lost the hull.
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore fulfilled all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, he claimed that no components were found on the ground following an investigation carried out in the field of impact.
In the search it was found that parts of the aircraft were not found in a different location, so the plane hit the mainland as complete.
The helicopter was intended for 19 persons, meeting all requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain displays slopes with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The mystery assured that at the moment, it is the most important thing to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of the Airport and Assistance Services, declared that, at the time of impact, the helicopter of the President's staff was moving through a trip speed and there was an accident at a soft rise terrain.
“This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a routine flight operation,” he said.
At the press conference, the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome named six basic points of the investigation:
Visual years:
In accordance with flight standards, years have been implemented according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reporting in AICM indicate adequate conditions at the start, in accordance with that aircraft progresses towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico, the visible layers of cloud were found at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the clouded crew, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavac Valley.
Location of impact.
The components of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar match, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disturbance of the flight trajectories before impact.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in restricted territory:
The information we have currently available allows us to assume that there was an impact on straight trajectories and from the side.
The dispersion of the rest of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was complete at the time of impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of disaster that would testify to the explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation show that several contacts with the mainland may have occurred.
During the field work, the rest of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above the sea, the terrain considered, above the glass ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images where there was probably a breakdown along the route.
The information provides elements which, as it seems, suggest that the helicopter could have reached several locations in contact with the countries.
After a careful search in the vicinity of an accident, in the area which is more extensive than the territory of discharge, there were no remains of a helicopter, which strengthens the idea that there was an impact in the state where the helicopter was even more complete.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched research into a gene that causes obesity
The Health Insurance Institute has researched to discover the gene responsible for child and adolescents' obesity. The research is implemented with support from experts from the IPN Institute.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that he was conducting research to reveal gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called “Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents” enables him to obtain results in excess.
In the report, Head of Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry from Specialized Hospital of the 21st century National Health Centre, Miguel Cruz López explained that the multidisciplinary team was established from doctors, sisters, nutrition experts and social workers.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where each congregation will be performed from 8 hours to the youth test.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sport Centre (Mexican State) and since October 8, this activity was also carried out in the Sport centre of Nehualcóolt (The State of Mexico).
As soon as the data are received from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sport centre of Independence (almost from the Federal District) and finally at the Sport Centre Morelos (north from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the objective of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity, and to track on Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabet on 14 November, he recalled that the objective was to collect data from 3 000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with consent and under parental supervision, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He stated that each Saturday, all participants are carrying out an anthropometric measurement (weight, height, circuit), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and gene testing (to identify genes that are involved in the formation of child obesity).
Cruz López stated that this research reflects the concern of health professionals over the alarming rise in children's weight.
'The protractoryactions implemented between 1999 and 2006 have shown that in only six years there has been an increase in obesity in boys by 77% and 47% for girls. The dramatic increase has also occurred in the case of overweights', said an expert from the IMSS.
He pointed out that one of the reasons for finding indicators was that the country's population was different from its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes that are responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as inability to burn the excess energy we consume and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they receive a total assessment of the status of children, thus determining whether they are showing any knowledge of overweight or obesity.
He pointed out that even the presence of a back of dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood that the individual would suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetes.
The information is confidential so far, the physicians hand it over to their parents in writing and explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyles that must be made to avoid their children's disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause abuse, obesity and other chronic diseases: the sedan way of life, which marked the lack of daily physical activity, day-to-day dissipation prior to television and the use of means of transport instead of walking short distance.
Overflow also causes large caloric intake, this is greater consumption of chilled beverages, hydrohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphlet with UNAM, there will be no decommissioning
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemic Faculty of UNAM, creates modified asphalt with polymers and creates a mixture with better functionality, independently of climate conditions and temperature
If it were right to care for glare, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 volts after each period of rain in the Metropolitan Region of Valle de México, pointed out Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of the UNAM, who also added that if construction and maintenance were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in the discharges or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the technological cause of the diesels which he conducted in the International Year of Chemistry announced that the laboratory under his direction develops modified asphalt with polymers, resulting in a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time more mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the most difficult part of oil, is the collection of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with large molecular mass that are called asphaltes, and others with low molecular mass that are called maltites. Together they add asphalt typical viscoelastic character.
Viscoelastic nature of asphalt consists of over 180 degrees above high temperatures, being treated as fluid, at 120 degrees has high levels of viscose and at 50 degrees is almost solid, while at low temperatures he tends to have a tensile strength, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, the expert pointed out chemical engineering.
The scientist from the Chemical Faculty observed that the majority of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered by flexible tiles, consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is the asphalt insert, consisting of small wallstones in asphalt and then pressed.
He pointed out that every stone that forms the cartridge is the asphalt.
When driving or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the tile will spread well.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would spread even better, thinking of a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt cartridge the last layer of the coat was placed, formed by fine stone, i.e. sand also in asphalt.
Since this layer is to come into contact with the vehicle handle, it must have more mechanical power than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the vehicle.
Since, as part of the gluing, it will be exposed to great burdens, it must have a flat sufficient thickness and must be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, water has a great influence on the function of asphalt inserts.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it's hard to get out, it causes the softening of all layers of the tiles and thus the formation of the sinks.
He explained that during the formation of volts, the film was the first to destroy the asphalt insert. However, the damage does not occur at one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped in the first signs using appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, it also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of diesels and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that, as far as asphalt is concerned, we are still waiting for a lot of work and research at the beginning. For example, asphaltic emulsions, which are already available in other countries and allow to be easily corrected without having to use high temperatures.
What lacked the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus acquires the 14th title of the first multimission.
Valle del Cauca has not again reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with the fact that she found herself on the prize, gained a silver crown and serpu, on the basis of which she became the new first multimission of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of last year's finale in Cartagena, where she won and the iron was captured by Miss Atlánico, the former department of the 14th title of the first multimission. Melina joined the representatives of the women from Valle del Cauca, which were won by the crown, but were finally declared the first multimissions. Among them include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellani Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzarez (1983), Olga María Arena (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica (1989), Maríla Pinedo (1990), President, Isabelro (1993 Girelleelle Girelléllie Garjure Aliu, Aljure Aliu.
The question many ask is, what's missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favourite which, in all previous rounds, showed that it had to become a new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen of Police and the Best Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, the Taliana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, which subsequently took off Miss Colombia's title.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint it only the First Multimission is the fact that she did not testify to her answer to the question: ‘What book you liked most and why, which was based on Martín Murillo Gómez from the Leamos literary editor.
The candidate answered the question:
I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of culture. The book, which influenced me most in childhood, was “The Little Prince, a very deep book.
At present, I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian author, which is a book that is part of the global literature that we should all know. Today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, Russian author, and it is a beautiful book called \"El ardor de la sangre\"
This reply did not, however, like it due to the term “culturalization” and secondly because the candidate did not explain what she had mentioned to her individual mentioned books.
After the end of the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and happy about the outcome: “The world is wise what is to happen, it will be.
And you people, read if you can. The little prince is a wonderful book -
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed her position as a favorite.
The Bogota journalist indicated that the candidate was the most popular, most famous and the one who took all the previous prices (Gastronomic Call Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and Queen's mother), encouraged to depend on other candidates, stressed the Queen who then burned down on the scene.
It was visible at the first presentation of a cruise on the Hilton beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even when she was on both lights, she knew she was missing strength and was asleep, which was presented by representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program -James at home - Canal RCN believes that Melinda gained the title of the first multimission confirms that a candidate who eventually won the most titles during the competition does not leave with Queen's crown -
In addition, Valle has held rather an unfriendly attitude to the media in recent days, and it has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis for the National Beauty Competition.
Just at the edge, two days before the election of the international jury, Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
In Miss Colombia's competition, beauty is not enough for itself, there is a need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is important to focus on social worship. It is important that candidates before entering the competition are involved in such projects.
It is also speculation that candidate Valle has lost points due to the lack of her background and fibrosis that was evident on the back. This is quite contrary to the verdict of the jury, which has chosen her mission-natural beauty - for the healthiest body, the right nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the Queen, acknowledges that Melina had not the best body that there were better girls, but problems with the fibrosis on the back, which, in my opinion, was not too good, took points to the last day.
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that the Valle native made a mistake when she stepped up several surgical treatments.
“Chirurgic interventions are fine, but they did not succeed in Valle.
The body was never her strong side, and here she chose her tax.
Because of this award, which was first awarded to the National Assembly of Beauty, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was a satisfaction that Raymundo Melina gave to her not to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina started her reign year today, not as queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions where the national competition itself will be appointed.
However, he will enter history as one of the queens, who, despite the shocking success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of the people of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfons Cana
A fingerprint expert from Cali walked into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfons Cana -
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th, last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: “Alphones Cana - by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department this week, there was a series on Elijah González, a man from Puert Tejada, who worked 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the Chocó town hall, where he had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to a place where there were corpses that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle's capital and after he graduated from the appropriate courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with a study of skin cutting, i.e. hands and feet.
At the week when an operation was carried out against that Alfonso Can, Eliazar told him to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expecting.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he'd have to identify two dead bodies and he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so they asked him to take a fingerprint card with Guillerma Leon Saenza's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team to a place where the corpse was located, he did not recognize him because of physical suspicion.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in a given area, no glasses, much deeper.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton lupou, ink and transplanter and light Eliazar began to compare the Dactyl records of the corpse with records from the card.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was -Alfonso Cano -
That same night, a man originating in Puerto Tejada was assigned to the Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón, to confirm whether it was really the supreme commander of Farc.
Search Track
For the dactyloscope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference is very important to Elazar González.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding criminal acts.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help to investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of people caught.
When they're caught, a lot of delinquents present fake documents or they don't have papers at all.
We're gonna get their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of a injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief resisted to pull out a safe full of jewels and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to be printed, but in this case we could get a copy of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts - he reminded.
Fingerprints may also confirm or reverse suspicions in case of murder.
The last time they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around themselves.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the label on the bottle actually confirmed.
Although it can't be confirmed that he was really a murderer, it's obvious that he showed up on the scene of a crime.
A fingerprint expert from the CTI explained that the articles are made up of fingerprints by using chemical or physical reactive substances.
When it appears, a transplant or a belt is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delikants or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians, whose data are not taken anywhere,” said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that's shaking, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there's traces left.
However, if it can be used, the corresponding comparison must be made.
“Exploitation - protesting in New York
Hundreds of manifests got into Zucotti Square, where they wanted to stand.
A large part of them were waiting for an order to clear the space and move to the nearby park.
The members of the movement Cast Wall Street provoked representatives of New York on Tuesday when they tried to get again on Manhattan Square, from where they were raised in the morning, and then tried to take over another New York park.
Hundreds of manifests were distressed at Zucotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allows them to return to their place. The second part of the movement responded to the extermination by taking a park in the north of town where there was another detention.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue in the legal battle with a view to returning to Zuccotti, both through the assembly and peaceful manifestaries,” said one of the speakers: “Let us set Wall Street - Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the answer to the “distorted” camp ordered by Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a command prohibiting the violent eviction of the site and allowed the manifests to continue to stand here.
In addition, they took another park on the crossroad of Central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the plots of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take their place, but then the police came and held up some manifestostants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw that the cuffs were loaded with some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious leaders has also come to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zucotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. There is anticipation to which court proceedings should take place on Tuesday and should be analysed by the legality of the morning evacuation.
Some of the above-mentioned manifestostants even distributed and gave copies of the court order and even gave them to those who were guarding the square, which caused some small clashes - to say Bray, who condemned the fact that some of the police's manifestations beat.
The Court order prohibits the removal of the members of the movement -Ocupa Wall Street - or the use - of laws which were published after the congregation began, or prohibits access to the park with stores or other places previously used -
Mayor Bloomberg stated for the press that, given this court order, the city had reopened the public space and manifested that the local laws did not allow them to return to their tents and sleeping facilities.
The High Representative of the City personally prevented the early eviction of Zucotti Square, an operation with which it was held for 200 people and to be brought up because the manifestatis had been directed by the law.
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it became the place where people did not protest, but to break the laws and in some cases harm others - because “some of the shops received threatening letters - and the“they were concerned about the quality of their lives -”
“Ran's extermination has been shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” added the spokesperson's movement, who accused the mayor that they are not responsible for freedom of expression.
The representatives of the movement, Ocupa Wall Street, also said that they were planning to organise a major event on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade organisations to remind the two months after which protests are being held.
Pamela Anderson will introduce Miss Maria on a special Christmas TV show
In conjunction with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, he will appear on the television program “It's and Russell Peters Christmas” on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at “Home Improvement”, a swimmer in “Baywatch”, a rabbit in “Playboy”, a wife of a year's musician Tommy Lee and now actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show of Canadian TV.
Today, the private television station CTV announced that Anderson and his singer, Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, will appear on television program “It's and Russell Peters Christmas, on 1 December, and will embellish Miss Maria.
CTV today has shown images from the TV program in which Anderson, also known from online home pornographic images, appears with her former husband, the motor -Mötley Crüe - Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding in the caves of the doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a tour moderator -My Violent Torpedo of Truth - Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters appear at the special CTV Christmas broadcast by Canadian singer Bublé, who was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, which is close to the controversial.
Recently Bublé called an American Kim Kardashian on one of her concerts in New York City - a lot
Japan is returning to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovering from the destructive earthquake, which has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government calculated material losses of USD 300 000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is well hit.
Following the three quarters of the fall, the GDP value between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to rotate the website with a definitive effect: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan, the tax year starts in March 2012 - in addition, they assume the highest growth rate compared to January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery necessary to restore areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, costs decreased by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get stronger or to restore infrastructure.
Japan has been awake. In particular, due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Toky has been entrusted to the internal market, when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the \"saving values\", for investors who run from the euro area debt crisis and against the worrying forecasts of the US. It is a privilege which is also a great burden on export companies.
With stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July until September just the course of the yen.
While markets continue to be covered by EU border countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
\"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen,\" said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Economic Cooperation and Development Organisation (OECD) stated that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
An indicator who predicts impropriety in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
She knocked four tens down to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even got below the average that is located at level 100. It got up to 99,13 points.
Athens once again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says savings will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty, which has failed again, Greece is increasingly involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the large debt crisis in Europe.
The idea that the new transitional Greek Government is given rather than the real conviction of political forces is being confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the time of 100 days he was appointed would probably be short for their application, the president of the conservative side of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would in no way support and repeat his request for a new election on the expected date of 19 February.
“The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit on 26 October”, said yesterday, during the parliamentary debate, which will give rise tomorrow by voting on the government’s trust.
Package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be between the first initiatives.
However, the Samaritan message makes no clear about his attitude: “We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional rule, but we have no further commitment.”
The President of the conservatives went a little far into his speech at the EU and IMF. These organisations are to block 8 billion that Athens urgently need. At the same time, he said he would not support and write no commitment to the implementation of the savings measures.
The European Commission, broken down already by the impact that caused Papandre to play with a referendum, pointed out yesterday that its requirements are uninterrupted: it will not block any aid unless the new government and representatives of the main parties sign a written commitment without biasy and as soon as possible,
Speakers for Economic Affairs, Amade Altafaj, explained that the Troyka inspectors will return to Athens soon, and will deal with the new government about what they need to pay the sixth part - 8 billion.
The Greek gland has just a little bit more to deal with.
Queen Sofia: “There are tools for progress and hope.
The Queen raises Spain’s privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance,
Last night, Queen Sofia reminded us that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades as regards this cooperation instrument, the essence of which is that it is a tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all of mankind.
Last night, the Queen launched a 5th global micro-credit summit in Valladolid with the belief that there is no doubt that this kind of operation is absolutely necessary, for us to achieve the objectives of a thousand-year-old set by the UN by 2015. “The domain is to meet the goals to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, i.e. with a portion that sets the threshold of poverty.”
Spain - will continue to work - and expand the network of volunteers - in all corners of the planet and take this responsibility - highlighted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of Summit, which will last until Thursday, will ensure that better capacity and opportunities are created for the poorest and particularly women who are designed primarily.
“We have already achieved many challenges, and the much challenge is still ahead of us.
The sum of micro loans is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support basic objectives.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and that 100 million families get above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro lenders spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after the pioneer of the ideas of Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen and added that the act was a act of righteousness and the necessary recognition.
The father described this instrument as a “observable idealist, who went on a path to combat poverty“ With his work, she met 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet herself directly on the spot with his lending policy.
Following this experience, the first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the London Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006.
Queen Sofia closed her performance by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions and thus allow them to continue fighting poverty.
The Ethical Impreativ.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity is an ethical imperative that all democratic states must follow.
In that sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balohotoby, as such cooperation is a ‘permanent obligation’;
Jiménez believes that micro loans represent a “serious and fair policy to eliminate poverty” - and now more than ever the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and do not allow solidarity to become the victims of cuts.
One of the main lines of development cooperation for Spain is the micro loan.
The state mystery for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept that we will give trust to people who are all closing the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city, which is the gate of the spirit of solidarity that is contagious.
The CDU proposes to vote on the European President on the basis of the general election law
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and chaired Christian Democratic Party Angela Merchel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig on the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the programme, but it happened until autumn, especially in order to satisfy the members of the parties who consider government policies today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow with Italy as lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates were suspended.
Several minutes of fruition stands at the end of Angela Mercel's performance and will be sent a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European Minister of Finance, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis -is not less Europe, but more Europe -
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “one million jobs depend directly on the euro”
According to chancellors in Europe, the time has come for change.
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general election law - with a view to giving Europe a single face -
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, an inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is out.
Similarly, delegates rejected a large majority proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's imagination, depending on the weight of its economy, which clearly results in the strengthening of Germany's weight.
The mayor was concerned to calm the climate inside her own party, the Chancellor made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmuta Kohl. But she did not try to get a Congress of Talks on Small - European countries or states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal for Europe is concerned with one paragraph of the importance of the French-German friendship - Angela Mercel France did not feel.
It's only indirect.
When she reminded me that a bloody battle took place two hundred years ago in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most humble defeats of the Napoleonese army.
What is fraud in the inability to work?
Following support, the party UMP and the government of the offensive against the working inability.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Office for Social Support, where he will address the issue repeated since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which comes out of the will to make savings in the context of increased strictness, but nothing less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on the inability to work.
First, because of budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity before they begin to receive disease support.
In fact, without the company's consent, an employee who gets sick would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
As well as measures that would be accompanied by further symbolic measures of reach: to give employees a single day of unfounded inability to work (and yet they have no inability compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority also launches the subject of fraud focused on evils linked to working inability this time.
“The checks will be much more extensive and additional: if you are caught, you will return,” pointed out Xavier Bertrand during the interview provided by the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about injustices in working inability.
These were in fact the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political barrier that brought their fruit.
The French are no longer ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop first with several official numbers.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladies (CNAM - State Health Insurance) more than EUR 237 million of daily refunds were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, daily refunds with EUR 11.3 billion in 2008 accounted for 5% of health expenditure.
This amount covered 46% of parental contributions and labour injury and 54% concerned the working inability, i.e. € 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of health costs.
According to Alma Consulting, in 2010, the French had an average of 14,5 days of incapacity compared to 17,8 days in 2009.
The average covering certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com working opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned replied that no working day had chosen.
Another study, this time carried out by the sickness insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of the working inability was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared to their European neighbours, French employees are no longer susceptible to working inability.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (Národní research centre) showed that the overall absence (from health reasons or not) was reduced in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
cheating in job failure represents only a very small part compared to work in black.
With regard to fraud, these are only a small extent.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at working inability of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM stated that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 cases were carried out due to short-term inability to avoid excessive or too long cases, i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled inability of more than 45 days, 11% of cases, not adapted or not authorised, were calculated at 1,2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
Total of the 169 000 non-legislative cases for several million employees who had a job inability.
The number that represents much less than the number expressing work on black.
According to MP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent EUR 9 to 15 billion missing in the tax selection for the year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Ppaddemos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, he made these words before Parliament, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, and added that a hundred days given to his government would not be enough to fulfil this task.
In order to reintroduce our economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new rescue budget plan - declared the head of the government during the Wednesday of its first public speech in the opening of the debate on the vote on trust in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone summit will be a major task - a new government, since the participation of our country in the euro area is added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the public deficit of the country would be from now until the end of the year - in the area of 9% - gross domestic product after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Act rejects new cost-effective measures
On Monday, Mr Samaras expressed his support for an already approved measure to try to escape from the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party did not undertake any additional cost-effective measures.
“We will not raise our hand for any new measure,” said Samaras to meet with the Members for his part, New Democracy.
We agreed on the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are opposed to any policy to prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantees from all parties who supported the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that its word was sufficient and that it would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Committee of Experts
According to the news of the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives the idea of refusing to die.
Only 9% of Canadians truly accept the possibility to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and take decisions in that sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive reports of the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas of ethics, law and medicine.
This Commission recommends that the Government amend criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears to be necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote the recent survey of an independent agency Economic Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada was placed in the 10th place, the study notes that “the medication of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death“
Mediacation yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in Quebec Province this is the highest number with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors of the reports come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which already said that there is no change in the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subjected to checks on all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered as a criminal case, there is no evidence that this discrimination causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides on persons who are invalid or disagreeable.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Dowie, the co-author of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases of these pretextants yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicides are not legalized.
The Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“There is also suicide in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Dowie.
Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Let us remind you that, according to the investigation carried out by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that they will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we send messages about the fact that the lives of old or disabled people are less valuable.
As regards those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the persons questioned judge that they should not be prosecuted by judgment.
In the case of maintenance or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, they say the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that criminal law the withdrawal of treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission also requires experts to be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fearing criminal prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or final calming already widely used in the Canadian health facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Receipts of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the experts report by the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signars of reports as “extrememní”, among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia on a hospital at the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be more than 18 years old could ask him to help commit suicide,” says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the texts yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks like the authors of the report have established the autonomy of people over all the other values that create society's social ancestors.
For “in society,” he says, there are warning marks and limitations--
Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report that she has qualified as the ‘manifest for euthanasia’.
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society itself, is particularly doubtful about the dates of the reports concerning the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the American state of Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to resign
Damašek speaks about “complot”
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Stoupents of Bashar al-Assad were manifested in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria of President Bašár al-Assad, who resists them with the support of Russia and talks about “complot” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Liz of Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan king Abdallah II yesterday was the first ruler of the Arab state to invite President Bashar al-Assad to the Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime were killed, “the power of the regime has been put forward”
“If Bashar had the interests of his country, he would have had to give demission, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new stage of Syrian political life”, said King Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On his side, the head of Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutogl regretted that efforts devoted to Turkish brokering in the Syrian regime had not been crowned with success since the beginning of the year.
“Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will go away,” said the next Syria, to which Turkey applies increasingly hard lines.
The United States has rejoiced in strengthening the consensus against Assad and the unfair conduct of the Syrian regime, following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
“International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey, are applying a more hard tone - to the repression of Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian human rights Observatory announced, there were 16 civilians and 19 members of temporary forces killed in Dera during this period.
According to this NGOs, two other civilian persons were killed in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy spheres in the city of Jobar - in Homs.
However, during a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Mouall, estimated that the country was ‘going out of the crisis’.
In fact, he was livingly responding to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus of membership, which, according to him, represents a “secure step”--
Sýrie -with failure to bow - supplied with assurance that ‘compulsives committed against Syria will not succeed’
Following its decision to suspend Syria, membership is currently considering the League of Arab States-mechanism for civil protection, and plans to send 500 human rights protectors, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is also favorably inclined by the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians against repression of the regime, which he believes is ‘paranoidly’.
The new special meeting of the League calls for tomorrow to be held in Rabat to take an opinion on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and in which it was assumed that the army had been specifically withdrawn from the cities sued by riots and liberation of trapped manifestists.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov considered yesterday’s decision of the League of Arab States to be “needful,” while China encouraged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but it was completely avoided to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and victims of Italy
The next head of the Italian government Mario Monti has asked for a little time to form his team and to start applying a program that will contain the “lost” program in order to regain confidence lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties before meeting representatives of experts and employers today.
It should build a relatively slim cabin composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
“Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims,” said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in talks, after meeting the proposed Ministerial President.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies of Gianfranco Fini expects that Mario Monti will ask the Parliament to speak with confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti performing a small team of twelve ministers President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of the financial markets and asked for time.
In the 'democracy', precise deadlines apply, as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that they were sure that markets would be patient and understood.
His appointment by the President was favorably accepted by the markets at first, but concern appeared again after the unexpected September industrial decline in the euro area.
The appointed Minister should set up a team involving, above all, technocrats, although stressing that he would like to adopt also “politicals” in it.
He expressed the belief that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the next election.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies of Gianfranca Fini, the new government will have the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to deal with extraordinary urgency after taking up his duties and with a view to becoming a strong article - Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that, even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change -
The European Union believes that, despite the cost-effective plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not reach its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, meeting with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to reanimate the economy - or a country that does not show growth cannot follow the deficit parameters -
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, is a pro-fessor symbolifiable by the authors of the initials - the challenge of severity - and - other Italy - represents a political change for Italy - after 17 years - ofberlusconism -
The great unsub will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place government bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
The Soviet scientist helped Iran’s nuclear programme
The Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Irana develop a detonator used for atomic weapon, reported on Tuesday an American non-governmental organization specialised in atomic risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents which have been excluded from this UN agency.
Last week, MAAE communicated its serious concern - as regards the possible military dimension - Iran’s nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute, a wide range of MAAE documents (born 1934), V. Danilenko (born 1934) has been working for three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet military research center in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where he should be involved with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the Centre should leave Kyev to set up a company producing-ano-diamanty in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society should bring him to contact the Irish embassy in 1995 in Ukraine.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme prior to his return to Russia from 1996 to 2002.
In his latest report, the MAAE recalls that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran was based on work by a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but which - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during a substantial part of his work career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of the country from which it came from -
Anti-Muslim crimes and delicacies rose by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and delicacies directed against Muslims increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while the other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase compared to the 13% in the anti- Catholic violence, the decline by 4% in opposition to Jews and the overall increase in 14% in anti - religious crimes and delicacies.
The total number of non-independent crimes was very easy to rise to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% of them were motivated by racial differences by the FBI and 20% of religious differences.
“After the crash in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and the deliths again to rise” stressed Human Rights First in human rights,“the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important,” added the organization in its communication.
“Human Rights First long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” adds one of the leaders of Paul Legendre.
The US Government can and must do more to deal with these bad guys - adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on non-independent criminal acts -
“Irrelevant crime, in US federal law, is the inheritance of civil rights fighting time.
This rule was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence associated with race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and resembles more Facebook
The Twitter Microbloging Service site introduced changes in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of the successors, which slightly resembles its Facebook service.
New offers - efficiency - a-name - enables you to know the activities of other people who are watching you or persons whose answers - these are - you are watching.
This allows you to know whether they enable to monitor the posts whether they are logged in to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new Twitter face was tested - in August at a small percentage of users - before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, the AFP spokesperson of Twitter Carolyn Penner said.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with dates somewhat inexcusable (RT for repeated distribution of the contribution of someone else, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un astrare utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'uvre aninsi and un public plus large avec un maniment plus comparable and celli des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their ‘tweets’ differ the importance of this innovation.
“It’s unnecessary, it takes a lot of places, and it’s too similar to Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“Funkce Activities will help me to watch some of my Twitter elements better” sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entry of the gold rules on the balanced budget into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday on the entry of the Golden Rules - Budgetary Policies into the Constitution to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any reduction in the assessment by Austria's credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was himself a socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision to conclude the advice of ministers in a situation where Austrian public debt is with its 74.6% high above the criterion of up to 60% of the Maastrich Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s compatibility was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more each year on the jury and foreign minister, the Christian democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria notes at the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that a reduction in the public deficit and the balance of public accounts be entered in the Constitution or the Act of the same values by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the German model - Germany was the first European country to adopt such - rule -.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0,75% of the gross domestic product (HDP) each year and, starting with 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries as well as municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to get the public debt under the criterion 60% of the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong but
Noda threatens a new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign markets if they had to continue strengthening.
“We will succeed, as we have done last time, if we find excessive stability, in a exchange course only, explained the Y. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, he only regressed to historical values which forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the jeans for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had just recently exceeded the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then, he has regularly encouraged the purchase of investors who consider it a secure port - in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar again got under 77 yen and the euro fell under the symbolic line of 105 yen near the levels that led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This flooding of Japanese currency damage island exports because it betrays the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of yields obtained by Japanese foreign companies when they transfer them into domestic currency.
“Japan is recovering from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the waves of the tsunami, which have decompanied the region of Tohoku in the north-east of the country, emphasised Y. Noda, who feared that this betrayal would not be killed yet in the egg of a fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% due to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by disaster.
However, the Prime Minister considered that the high value of just did not reflect the ‘national economy of Japan’,
The Japanese Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures leading to weakening only.
However, the multi-governaire of this institution Hirohide Yamaguch pointed out that BoJ had already adopted appropriate measures, indicating that no additional monetary weakening can be expected at the centre.
At the end of October, at the end of its final meeting, the Institute for Securities issues increased by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) of its purchases of Treasury bonds and increased to EUR 55,000 billion alone (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts dedicated to the purchase of various securities with a view to flooding with liquidity.
Euro area:
Rates rise, storms fail
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermined by European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to grow.
The European storms still concerned about the stability of the euro area are now under negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris at 10 hours CAC Index 40 loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
“With new tensions around the euro area loans, which are in trouble, the stock markets around the world continue to yield only part of the recent profits.
“Nervnost investors are merely too aware of the risk of disease,” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The storm in Tokyo closed with a decline of 0.7%, which suffered from market concerns about Europe’s ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“Japan as well as the rest of the world has eyes pointed to Europe and the shift will continue only in the narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized, estimated Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunching of uncertainty regarding the future of the euro area damage the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has reached the lowest level since the month and half.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is $1.3570 at a retreat of 0.4%.
According to the money brokers, it took place after the CDU’s office of Angela Mercel accepted a proposal at her congress on Monday to leave the euro area for countries that are in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian 10-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the return on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen market concerns.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti strongly demanded time on markets so that he could correct the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by the advantage of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit would be a major task - its governments.
Spain is again in the intentional line of the markets when the elections to the Chamber of Members are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
In anticipation of the euro area growth numbers
Statistical numbers say France recorded a 0.4% growth in the third quarter due mainly to household consumption, i.e. a little better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downwards for the second quarter to a decline by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that economics are most concerned about.
Germany registered growth by 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogma
If there is a theme that cannot be understood on the basis of short-term balances or emotions, then it is an energy policy.
Dispatch and price of electricity have a direct effect on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for a meeting at elections to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if it examines all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed possibilities.
The French must put their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will cause from now on to 2050 to double demand for electricity, if we do not want a significant part of the world's population to rid important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to face the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, while it cannot be forgotten the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is the idea that is currently being removed from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima has no influence on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not a case of Belgium, which will make its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the last generation power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to agree on their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand their park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality resists it.
Berlin's choice is shown by cheating electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported mainly from Russia, by a sharp increase in CO2 emissions generated by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will all experience these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The Denmark case deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which 30% of its electricity is also one of the largest coal and gas consumers due to wind volatility, for which CO2 emissions and prices of Danish electricity are higher by 65% or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, our energy policy will pay our neighbor's electricity invoice by 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While the globalised economy is a key factor in the competitiveness and guaranteeing industry's maintenance on national territory, the French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity that would make the Ilusorian beautiful declaration of reindustrialisation of our country and defence of purchasing power.
The price that the large majority of the French refuse to pay, as is essentially not opposed to this energy, as shown by public opinion surveys.
Let us remind you that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to build 125.000 direct jobs and with 410,000 incoming jobs.
Strongly exporting industries are taking on international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises that create jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose EUR 6 billion per year, which countries obtain for exports of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer's failure would be planned?
When dealing with the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, but there is neither devilish.
The development of low CO2 emissions plants and renewable energy plants carried out by the French industry of the AREVA report on the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, absolute necessity is to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromised and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new plants in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognised have the idea of blood safety.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Miles Island has been in normal operation conditions and has remained without human sacrifices and environmental consequences.
In Montenegro, drama has caused the concept of a reactor and unexplainable human error.
In the case of Fukushi, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented extent that caused the death of tens of thousands.
The core industry will learn from this crash just like it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the co-operation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operator and constructors is that the EPR reactor is capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it to be stopped by its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to the competitors of the AREVA Group and the EDF Group and to release the path to strengthen their position in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best solutions of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogma and machination control the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is there a burden or chance for the immigration economy?
The immigration policy carried out by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the enactment of police, courts and administrations subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of human rights - which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment, whose object was foreign students, who became current when the Minister of Interior (see Libération of 23 May), declared that France - does not need foreign talents, publishers and waitresses -
But it has not been long since been discussed under the angle of the economy.
It is necessary to say that there is a rather broad consensus between left and right in this area.
On the right hand in 1976, Jacques Chirac gave his statement that 900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where there are 2 million immigrants, and Michel Rocard on the left, when in 1990 he said that France could not accept all the poverty of the world.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005 the fear of the invasion of the mountain of Polish installations in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the level of generosity that we make available to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to banking when he states that the joint development will allow us to solve our ‘migrating problem’ -
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be paid in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As pointed out by the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published works synthesize the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.): There is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
The reduction in immigration will protect growth and employment damage.
The concerns caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than alternates for French employees by performing work in sectors with a lack of employees.
Little qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer places.
Positive impact on wages
Like a surgeon, there will be trouble working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this addition between the French and migrants has a positive effect on wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri so calculated that the increase in migration movements by 1% would lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0,6 and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants brought in contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel Awards; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors in European countries to social systems on average up to 1% of the overall budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that one immigrants will come to Germany at the age of 30 for their entire lives to make a net contribution to public budgets (let's minus expenditure) EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his mandate to reach the missing percentage of growth - with fine teeth -
It was the opposite effect of the change in teeth used to repel immigrants.
Europe has invented democracy, the European democracy remains to be thought
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember that, although in Athens two thousand years ago he invented it, he experienced the tragedy of world wars, totality regimes, holocausts, gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar, Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that, in order for democracy to ultimately triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to make choices and implement it in the most direct way.
Yet, he knows from Napoleon that it was an easy thing to think about.
General election law, although a condition for democracy is necessary, is not a sufficient condition and can become a ‘printing system’, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organisation separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is a economic crisis, but it is that way and from the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Recognizing the Greek referendum, yes-no, will have the value of double detection in this respect: to detect the need for a great return of political power, but also to reveal the disturbing feeling of its impossibleness, its inadequacy.
This ambition must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic flood have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters no longer shoot in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we require a number of national referendums organized according to necessity and disorganisation.
Bianko exposed to a European absolute monarch or jump with tied legs into an empty nationalist depth: what a choice for citizens!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but together, full, peaceful and continuous performance of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we have known where to stop the account - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is depressing before the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and its lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole Europe, which slowly loses its sovereignty and with each of its nations.
The management of the European democratic sovereignty project should be urgently returned.
For only together Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to rid the governments of the markets and to prepare the future.
The exit from the crisis will assume decisions at a European level that will not be able to be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disasters.
After we have long fought against this proposal of Socialists and Jacques Delorse, all today strongly demand the European Economic Government.
So be it.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and being experienced as such by citizens would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We need to take a new phase of European building on each other.
In order to create a Republic in France, it was necessary to ‘was the Republicans.’
The revolution in interests couldn't have done enough to do that.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
‘Unclosure cards are spread
The optimistic atmosphere will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world trade fair of chips cards.
The year 2011, according to the Eurosmart cabin, should end with an increase in world card sales with microprocessors (bank cards, telephones with SIM card) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The largest is a segment of non-contact technology that allows you to pay in bulk transport or to make purchases just to approach the card to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
In 2012, their share should continue to increase (optimal 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC, Europe gets the terrain in the uncircumcised payment.
Approximately 26 million bank cards Visa is already equipped with this function and 75.000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, beginnings are more modest: 400,000 uncontact cards Visa were issued.
But big business chains work in two.
So Carrefour issued 2.5 million without contact cards of Pass MasterCard this year.
To set up a higher speed step, it is necessary for the banks to recall their clients from now on.
The two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients with credit cards, reports Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only the first step towards the payment of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to perform transactions is today only a small number of devices.
‘The delays have been delayed’
But their real boom should take place in the next year -
“For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world in 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are getting ahead of themselves.
Banka Crédit agricole reported yesterday the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will last from December until June next year.
The iPhone equipment of approximately 200 clients and coworkers will be equipped with a case that allows non-contact payments.
Bank BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And société générale reported yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer authorising its clients to pay with a mobile phone-free.
The Terristic Front is from Sahary to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaada in Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicion that there are links by the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian section Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister Abdelkader Mesharel even admitted that Algier had acquired certainty from now on:
The way both organisations operate, and the reports of noticeable services show that there is a large co-operation between them - explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocourt and Vincent Delory were killed the following day as a few of their kidnappers during the operation by special French units.
The French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists at the scene.
Terotic axis
The analysis of calls carried out leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigator is interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the co-chair of Boko Haram, and the other one to the person who is called to be close to the AQMI and the sect.
“It is progress, but it must be doubtful to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram”
But it's possible.
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support, and that it is becoming more active in this regard, a mild statement by the Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this “support” was more and more obvious in the development and presentation of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same method of implementation, such as the devices used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community at the head of Washington has developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has created.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group of small-valued mystics to be a community of small interest.
Quick Success
Sekta Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the Mohammed Yusuf Mohammeda Foundations. Boko Haram, which in the language of Haoussa is a sin - approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, this connection has a rapid success.
The Section is regretting and requiring strict respect for Islamic law of sharia while its followers are starting to fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s followers become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
Government response is usually the same.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf section is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group is radiating and leaving its center in the north.
On Christmas 2010 he will perform in the city of Jos atentat, where 80 people will die, another one in Abuja's capital.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the United Nations local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying about all security specialists.
Now that Al-Kajda Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and iger and Somalia from Al-Sabab movement in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in an emergency state and is ready to report all the information,
World according to Presidential candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran or Israel’s help, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are being promoted in simplification and ignorance.
Can America manage a weak crisis through simple or even simplifying ideas?
When you listen to the presidential candidates, the voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others repeat the wordless statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is already a traditionally strong point of the Republican.
Often undisputed slogans about China, Iran or Israel’s help work together.
Mitt Romney, the best-forcing candidate in the competition for the Republican nomination -Grand Old Party - threatened China's profession against the World Trade Organisation and their accusations - because of manipulation with their currency - which is a motivating theme in America of the widespread migration of the entire part of its industry towards Asia.
That's worse if this has to contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador in China, and the only candidate having some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, was almost crushed in a position that “hazards“ emotions.
He required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (a current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's at the last positions in election estimates, remains inseparable.
To the picture of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes to Iran if they did not succeed in the sanctions in stopping his nuclear programme.
“If I am elected, I will arrest Iran,” said the fanfaronist.
\"If Obama is elected again, they will have a bomb.\"
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance by accusing Obama that he had failed in his responsibilities to this partner.
Businesser Herman Cain, the second best known candidate, shows an awkward lack of document.
He has recently called for a sharp attitude against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing has been trying to develop nuclear capacity - clearly unknown fact that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants punches against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan had also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They recall Obama himself being amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the sudden departure from Iraq, its excuses regarding Libya, and thus bring him the label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The people are judged by President Obama's national security policy, which has removed Ben Laden rather positive.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military intervention leading to the outburst.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically so that it can be resuscitated by its leadership, Obama's knock on the right place.
Nord Stream, new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The long pipeline Nord Stream, connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea, began to work.
It has to deliver a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gasworks, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 Heads of State and Government, took part in the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany to the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together with control around the valve control entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
This new pipeline will start to flow every year to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional Cuban gas meters by the first pipeline with a length of 1 224 km connecting the Petrohrad region with the Federal countries of Mecklemburg-Pomors.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow to supply a total of 55 billion Cuban gas meters, which is equal to the total French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third gas pipeline on the same route is already recalled.
Pro Gazprom has early completion of this huge building the nature of victory.
The project strongly protested Poland and the Baltic countries.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow to supply the gas directly to Germany without being led by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries lose some power: the possibility of pushing Russia into threats that they close its access to the Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
She expressed it more often when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the New German-Soviet Pact, with appealing to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means it's politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater assurance of its purchases in this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created a crack between Europeans from east and west.
Russia has barely five years ago put its vision of direct alliance between Russia and the rich western states with high gas consumption, whose bearings are approaching their end.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that physically connects us,” confirmed François Fillon during the opening of this gas pipeline and demonstrated, at what point are large gas contracts of things both political and economic.
This explains all the wide smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the supply point of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical act.
Undersea pipes are provided with concrete coat steel in order to protect from the anchors of marine vessels.
It consists at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During his construction, there was a need to avoid mine fields from World War II.
“For their safety almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed,” says Jens Müller, the spokesperson of Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffelovek, which throughout its length is not interrupted by any valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were little willing to see the Russian state company, as it was permanently planted on their coast.
In case of failure, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute - specified by Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely to be the builder, for the welds have been designed to result once every 100,000 years.
Control the gas state from the outside is carried out by a submarine robot carried out by a ship, while the interior of the gas pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pressurized by gas.
For the whole three days of the journey of 3 m/s, the target provides accurate information on possible transformation of metal parts.
The long gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without having to make it easier to repair.
Gas circulation is simply provided by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in the target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader of Gazprom remains responsible for 51%.
The German company E.ON and BASF (1.5.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9 % each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was entrusted with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
The company has its registered office in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely beneficial.
Gazprom subsequently leased this company for five years with the Treaty which could be renewed, all its capacity for gas transport.
‘Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whether the amount of real-run gas is any, specified by Jens Müller.
The financing of gas construction was ensured by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total labour costs should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
So, for the GDF Suez group, investment costs rose up to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident to return their costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lublin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
Ventilated high 4,5 metres is a gas exit gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported into German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives every hour one million Cuban meters of Russian gas.
When we reach full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - signbook
The Italian company Moleskin, founded fifty years ago, wants to give joy to writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in light of candles.
Moleskine is easy to distinguish with his black rectangle plates and their leaves, dressed as old-time white colors.
In fact, Moleskin's journal, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to place a new design but distended registration on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the undertaking, is to be used for the introduction of a new product.
The author is inspired by an old production technique -moleskin - (skin amritation) which is used for the treatment of the surface of the bench.
This type of journal was awarded to writers and travelers.
“Moleskine returned to the tower of an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the Avantgard artists up to the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager of the brand at the company Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle for 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a remote classified product from the first years when only 3 000 registrations were produced.
Moleskin is crossing the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to build some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the registration will be taken by businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskin's diary is that his owners are cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings today, has almost one hundred and since 2008 it has two offices, one of which is in Milan and another in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through a chain of FNAC stores into small boutiques in the centers of the cities where he could put his identity.
“We followed the spirit of time and this need for a new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanys the development of the journal Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition - Zacházka - where architects or artists exhibit their journal.
In August on the occasion of a film festival in Locarn, she also presented a new record of leopardy.
Moleskin benefits from his success and this cultural aura and divests his products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop case ... The brand expands to a whole range of carriers.
The success that raised the addiction: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was bought by investment funds of SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is such a high proportion of unemployed hendiciped workers?
Around 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today, the 15th week for the employment of the hendikipeds is opening.
Despite the volunteering public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons is even more than twice the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the population.
Is it debilitating?
\"No, it undermines the Éric Blanchet, the Director-General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of Hendicipeped\"
The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable.
- At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice the number, but three times higher -
There is nothing else to do about it.
It should be said that many obstacles persist for unemployed persons prior to their entry into work.
They are older: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% have no graduation, and from 2.3 million college students, there are only 10,000 hendiciped students.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% on the hendicipeped compared to 38% on average.
In short, such criteria are particularly complex to return to employment and represent the “a centre of the problem”, according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin, founded in 1992, to help companies to receive the hendikiped workers.
So much for objective brakes.
It remains uncircumcised, the ways of thinking that certainly develop, but too slow.
Study conducted in April of the Association of IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the questionable managers have a weak level of knowledge of persons who are illiterate, with a view to individuals in mobile chairs and mental or mental deficiencies.
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from reaching the target of employing 6% of the employed workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers that came from 2008 provide a state equal to 2.6%.
\"We are now moving around 3%,\" says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, responsible for collecting fees from undertakings that do not comply with this law.
It shows that the number of fines, businesses, as well as the amounts paid that have fallen between 2007 and 2011 from 59.000 provinces to 46.000 (and from 606 to EUR 480 million).
“The 2005 Law, which increased its contributions, has created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc“
But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large lifts.
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees are employed as well as 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: ‘What happiness’
Before Tuesday evening (20h45) they call on French representatives (Bleus), Eden Havard and Georges Leekens not to hide the pleasure that will bring them this friendly play.
We're not going so far as to write that there was a partnership between them, but the picture is symbolic.
The sitting next to each other at the Stade de France's Tribune was simply and well Georges Leekens and Eden Havard made peace.
Five months after the wrathful gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach to his player was only the words of praise.
“I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country.
“I want to move forward,” assures the French Lille player.
As regards the difference between his performance in club matches and national team matches, it is one thing and the same, it is justified--
I've been in Lille for a year, which is not a case with Belgium.
\"I need to clear my mark.\"
Hasard, a saving against Romania on Thursday night because of this fight against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally light -
It is not possible to forget the concept of ‘radity’.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from 7 years and in their winnings in 1998 and 2000.
I've always been a fan, he says.
This will necessarily contribute even more to the nature of this meeting.
That's more because, opposite the name Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), he reminds.
“We have been taking action immediately”
\"I can play against them, it's just a pleasure.\"
Dobractionally, Leekens reminded even-the-hrzeth.
-Father - Fighting the match - holiday -
A high-level team has become a team of the city of Knysna, which has become a very high-level team in the south African city of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a great piece of work - he has breathed.
Perhaps Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with French direction... Brazil.
\"Our little Belgians will become great - undercut.
“We are building something right now, the players are ambitious, they are healthy hungry”
“Recognize it for the next fight - including it against France.
Portugal very confident
Portugal’s coach Paulo Bento launches a large opticism against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
There was no realism on the way there.
“At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and especially a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. Portugal's football representation, since 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal shares 90 minutes of happiness.
One game remains to be played and one opponent - Bosnia.
In the light of the Friday result,0 in hell of Bosen Zenice it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of advantage, but it was not able to give such a rare goal to heal him.
“It’s a good result, however, which includes the risk because we have not put the goal outside.”
But at home at their wonderful Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, Portuguese believe that they will go before an audience that should create a boiling boiler, even though the match is definitely as - very balanced - says an optimist, but a sister considering Bento.
“We expect a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can be on top,” declared a twenty-four-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have 50% chance of being on Euro 2012”, relativated yet the successor Carlos Queiroze.
The indecent Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An inconvenient match can only be done to the Bosňians who also need to score.
“It is a good result, however, which includes a risk because we have not put a goal outside, regrets Bento.
“We will play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality - added.
As in Zenica, Portuguese people will be interested in developing the Bosen team immediately from the beginning of the maximum pressure so that they do not give them time to think about it -
Good idea, on condition that this time will show itself to be realistic.
