Now the new guy helped Trabzonsporu to the second place, and the damage also took place.
Defender Filip Novák helped the goal in the last round of Turkish football league Trabzonspor to title the Vice Minister.
His team won 2-1 on the Kayserispor field and held the third Besiktas behind him.
The attackant Milan Škoda gave after the January crossing from Slavie already the tenth goal behind the Risespo, which he saved, though he said 1:3 on the line of Fenerbahce.
The new guy confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh goal in this league year.
In 63 minutes, the goalman Kayserispor just went off with a sharp shot and the Czech footballer shot the ball in the net.
The house managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of setting the win hit on his side when he successfully finished the gate four on one.
The damage in the introduction of the second half of the game with Fenerbahce compared the salt to 1:1.
Even though the inconvenient condition did not last long, it did not have to freeze him, because the results of the rivals remained three points above the seat belt.
The competition will end the Sunday duel of the Master Basaksehir at the court of Kasimpas.
A well-secreted caver in the woods of Nový Bor, in fact, was not a resident.
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of Lužické Mountains, near Nový Bor on Czechoslovakia, in the forests which led the Counting Road, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Natural and artificial.
And we're married to the human hand created.
The place is called Cave by the braid.
In fact, however, there was never a measlesman who lived here, and the caves served as a hideout, more precisely a hiding chamber, apparently on the grain.
The cave is carved from the side to the rock security and accessible to the stairs above.
But it's practically impossible to see until the last moment.
She'll be exposed to the narrow stairs leading to some kind of rock gallery, from where she'll just enter the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far away from the human dwelling, at the time of creation it might have been on a mountain platform where the forest is today, the field.
“The fact that this object has no window and no traditional place placed topensars clearly shows that there could never have survived the winter,” explains historian Kamil Podrážek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purky in Usti nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench serving apparently to remove the container.
“I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field,” adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are visible traces of instruments on the cave walls.
The sanding of the sandstone was quite simple and fast for the hung up.
It was enough to use the clutches and the sandstones to gradually disassemble.
According to the length of the track track, and the season of cave formation can be determined in a frame at all.
The historian says it's probably about the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, there is sometimes sleeping in today's daytime.
If you approach the cave from one of the forest paths and take you under the cave of running spots and the nearby Counting Path, you will surely find the way down as well.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be captured by the nearby Havranian rocks.
The yok of Minařík is after a difficult fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
“Filip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is ordered to do similar cases, and we also have a part of the family in Hannover fortunately.

But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
“Our network for electromobility we began to build only last year,” explained Jan Jusková's spokesperson.
However, Deník's reduction has obtained exclusively data from all 216 electric standers operated by ČEZ.
It shows that the drivers from the station have taken 13.5 kWh on average.
It corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometers of smaller electric motor.
If we skip the small pumping until 1 kWh, it takes two and a half hours to charge average.
The vast majority of tanks then took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists paid already, their typical loss was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is mainly located in the capital.
The area of Prague is located in all five of the most ecclesiastes of CEZ’s company, which has its popularity covered by the whole country city.
The regions then lead Olomouc.
On the contrary, the smallest interest is about remote stations in the border, such as Bohumina or Prahatice, which often remain throughout the day without use.

Vodka and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonah and Karolínka's daughter are staring at each other, they're not easy at all.
Jonah is in love with his father, the involuntary waterman Hasrbach, and Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Even though there's a young Libor who's gonna do everything to protect the village, and especially Charles, from that waterless villain.
What if he's intrigues and lying?
Especially when he can reject Karolínka Jonah and preferred him to be a fine Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone in the village who can drown the night convigos, spoiled flour, fire mills and other lotrins.
The villagers will arrange a hunt for water, and to do so, Jonah's head will be affected by an impenetrable water curse.
And now, the Convite's soul, Karolínka, fight!

The hospital infection department is half empty, even if the infected numbers grow.
“This situation today and April is completely different, and it is given mainly by the number of hospitalised,” confirms Adam Vojtěch’s Minister for Health.
It is worth reminding that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in us, they carried out all the bugs, sampling carried out by the army, the Republic was closed and the Czechs used the disinfectant for a year ahead.
Yet, ten people die daily.
Now, the daily increases in the number of infected people are now higher, but every day with covid-19, they die up to two people.

Van den Berg wrote a story, Anderson's trash
The great surprise tournament on behalf of Dimitri van den Berg made excellent performance even in the fight against a player who won the second most prestigious firm within the PDC in 2018.
Introduction of the match was bilaterally balanced, the break came in state 8:7 for Belgian arrows.
Van den Bergh took the bracelet with a 13-legged leg, and he's been on top ever since.
His opponent literally crushed his game and much more experienced -Léting Scotland - he was hardly able to reach the doubles.
The way he had, the dream maker, in the pride, shows that the angry Anderson played his first maximum in his 24th leg.
In addition, young Belgians managed well-high checks.
The last time he lost in the 11th left, he caught a large fish, and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson saw a huge frustration.
The arrow was just throwing away, and his behind the triumph of a walking opponent was completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned the first of the three mats of donations first and finished his name - wrote his great dream.
The profit of trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable for the Belgian scorpor that it is his first winning major.

The government, taking into account the growing number of infected people throughout the Czech Republic, has once again introduced an obligation to wear bugs at internal events over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now making 1000 people.
The government's procedure, when no clear action has been made until the last moment and when they start paying or when they're declared, criticisms have been made.
“I think that, in a situation that is relatively tight, the main factors should create a sense of certainty and that confusion, on the contrary, compare,” said Senator Marek Hilšer in the questions.
The measures may now differ according to the region, for example in Prague from Sunday, from Sunday, the obligation to wear bugs and non-stay medical devices, i.e. in pharmacys or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear bugs when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacy has also been introduced since Friday in Liberec and Ústice Region.

On the contrary, anti-Epidemic measures have been released in Moravia as well as in the Mediterranean region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government has also approved the so-called European semafore, which colorically distinguishes the level of disease risk across European countries and, accordingly, lays down rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In countries with low and medium-risk risks, since June 15, Czech citizens have not required a negative test for the Coravirus or instead do not require quarantine.
These are compulsory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.

It goes to the feet of the girl, the 2010 year, which the parents delivered to the rescue base on their own, said Denika the regional spokesperson of medical rescue services Mária Svoboda, after which they transferred the child to the hospital in Klatov.
Zmije is the only poison snake in the Czech Republic, and these animals are found in higher numbers in the country right now, and it is therefore good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chance that you get upset is not too high, in normal contact they're afraid of themselves.
And if she has space to do so, she likes to get away from her voice mail.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
But even her distress is not a tragedy, although her poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or is suffering from allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore particularly in children, seniors and allergies.
“The man often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, having increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals and in particular allergys can occur until anaphylactoid shock,” she wrote for Deník Miriam Gredová from the Klatov hospital.

One time, he even went out on his own to parapet windows where he was turning.
The police are still investigating men.
More information he doesn't want to publish yet.

Sapa Market: Razie revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
One of the vehicles entering the area transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the Assanation Company,” declared the State Veterinary Administration.
When checking the stand with live fish, it was found that the seller had no evidence of origin for the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.

Putin was on the phone with the Greens before the start of the peace in Donbas, Kremlin criticizes the planned elections.
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke phonely with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymiem Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he should start paying for a new measure from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin declaration, inter alia criticized the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament on the local elections; Kyev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of the suspended Ukrainians.
On Wednesday evening, Ukraine and Russia agreed to support the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The measure is to start after midnight at night on Monday, it is to be complete and general - and it is intended to open a way to comply with other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections contradicts the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens the prospects for the settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Parliament decided last week that a clear choice to local representativeship would not take place in the territory of controlled Prorusian rebels.
The Minska Agreement assumes that Kyev will get back under control of the borders of the Ukrainian lands occupied by separatists with Russia after providing a broad autonomy to these regions and will organise local elections here.
According to the Union's Green Office, both states agreed on the usefulness of the upcoming measure in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to support peace in this region, such as demining the areas of combat or withdrawing parts of the unit from the front.
The Green Putina also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied semi-preserved Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minska agreement helped stop fighting, in occasional shootings and artillery attacks, however, people continue to die on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has been over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denys.
Greensky made his priority from the end of the war in Donbas, but there has not yet been a major breakthrough in the negotiations.

The problem is that there weren't any boys and Kope set up here, because the results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very well, I appreciate most of the fact that I had given a person about 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was even more pleased with the bar and I was most disappointed by the disc, where I was disproportionate,\" he admitted on the union Facebook.
On the first day of the seventh day, she won with more than a hundred-point overweight Kateřina Cach, even though she was suffering from a wounded ankle on her reflective leg.

Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
The liquefied oil gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its substantially lower price compared to petrol or oil, which is significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per km.
As well as petrol and oil, it also has its ecological gray variant --bio LPG -
But it is a whole new - in the European market, it first appeared before and to the Czech Republic, according to the press release of the Czech LPG Association a few days ago.
“In these days we received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping station in a mix with classical fossil LPG,” quoted Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, the bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or bionaft.
According to the association, the chemical is consistent with the classical oil LPG, which in its cars a number of motorists tank now.
That is why it is possible to mix both versions freely.
“The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the method of production,” says Bio LPG Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, as well as distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as a by-product in the manufacture of bioethanol from food residues and cane.
In the future, it should also be produced targeted, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
On the other hand, the classical oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly separation in the production of natural gas.
Thus, depending on the technology of production and the source of operation of the vehicle on the bio LPG by 40-70% of the greener carbon footprint than the operation of the LPG oil and up to 90% compared to oil.
It is not, however, a CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called ‘well-to-tank’ (Czech-from the source to the tank-
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG currently belongs to the petrochemical company Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan, net mobility (NAP ČM) researches the possibility of production and Unipetrol in its Lithuanian Refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 000 vehicles are driving to LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, about 200 000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 ceasefires were carried out last year.
The LPG is available at approximately 950 stations of different operators in the Czech Republic.
The soldiers revised the numbers of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
The Minister for Health Adam Vojtěch (after ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of the corravir infected virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday afternoon, the number dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 infected less.
Therefore, 3422 patients are currently ill in the Czech Republic.
The revision of data, which has recently not been updated by the hygiene industry, says the Head of Health Statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected in the Czech Republic, 11 419 were healed and 371 Covid-19 diseases were unfortunately aggravated.
Mobile electoral units or a correspondence option.
Political and sociologist were looking for variants for a pandemic period
In order for people in quarantine to vote in October’s national and Senate elections to vote for coronavir, according to the Vice-President and Minister of the Interior of Jan Hašek (ČSSD) to be able to change the law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in a accelerated regime.
He did it on Sunday at Prime's Party TV.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
- Let's do anything, so it's going to have to mean a change in the election law,\" Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called for the government to find solutions under applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister said that it would be necessary to modify the provisions of the law according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of health.
The ban should remain maintained for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM programme stated that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts with its introduction to the vote abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers ANO or ČSSD concerns (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather be recorded by other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overvalued.
Personally, it is against electronic voting opportunities, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now an ad hoc needs to devise mechanisms (volebs) that could be done this year and with the least health risk.
The main thing is to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
A correspondence call (or in foreign or Czech) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As others, they see the already mentioned electoral units or perhaps the possibility of a disputing vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn about such situations - elections at the time of the Coravir - discussed in Croatia, Poland or France.
This year, various types of elections in 67 countries have been postponed due to the spread of coronavirus diseases.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pigs' ears threw demonstrators at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against the Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojek Borisov and his cabins have placed a pig ears on the building of the government.
It was another series of protests against the \"Mafian style of rule\" that took place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning at the center of the national block, and DPA has said.
Today's protest, which took place on 18th day after each other, was according to the Radio Free Europe/Rádio Freedom to take a weaker part than the previous one.
About 300 people met by 8:00, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the government had played a theatre scene, which symbolically closed the Prime Minister Boris and the Attorney General Ivan Gesev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a powerful political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Resignation of both is a fundamental requirement for protesters.
They also required the abolition of the declared health reform and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea Coast.
The organizer of the protests Nikolai Hadjigenov today stated in the public debate that on Wednesday he was about to become an escalced - in the form of a ‘national manifestation in Sofia and blocked throughout the country’
He repeated his request for the resignation of Boris and his government as well as for the elaboration of early elections.
The proper ones should be made in March 2021.
Borisov has already said that he will not depart.
This was justified, inter alia, by the need for Bulgaria to implement the pandemic of the Covid-19 and its resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he changed five members of his government team, not to calm down the demonstrators' retreat.
At the beginning of this week, Boris's government has ceased to vote in Parliament on trust in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlič no longer wants to fight without the audience
The football coach Boloni Siniš Mihajlovič already has enough games for Italian leagues without audiences.
Serbia's coach hopes that fans will return to the stadium since the new season.
What we're doing here right now is not football.
I'm tired of playing games without audiences.
It's a headless football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
The fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks it,” Mihajlovič said before the fight against Lecce today.
After the coronavir break, they follow the Série A matches in a fast sequence, and even though they're playing until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
We play in a terrible heat every three days.
He won't even know how the teams are.
It's time this season is over.
These measures had to come to the competition, but I hope that fans will be back from September,\" said the coach who had led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlover, this season is extraordinary because four months on the bench have not been due to the treatment of Leukemia.
Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everyone else has managed to move our team to a level above.
We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger,\" he said.
We have become the target of cybercrime of foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, many Iranian military, industrial and nuclear equipment, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and companies have been reported by fires and explosions.
Some Iranian agents said that the fire that broke out this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could cause cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been explained.
The spokesperson of Iran's Foreign Ministry Abbas Musáví told journalists according to Iran's media that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic daily is facing ‘thousands of cyber attacks’,
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them would be able to bounce.
In recent months, according to Musaví, several major cyber attacks have been recorded, followed by the analysis of the government and group,
However, the nearer details of possible perpetrators did not, according to Reuters.
They must also add that fires in forests, refineries and in other places are common in the summer.
The Iranian State Agency’s article IRNA discussed this month that the enemies of Iran, as Israel and the US, could stand as recent incidents.
But neither one of these countries has been accused of any particular attacks in the article directly.
Iran and the United States have interrupted diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and 444 days were held hostage by 52 Americans.
The long-term tensioned relations between the two countries took place in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran which have a severe impact on its economy.
Another important escalation came this year after the American army killed Iran's general Kase Solejming and a member of the management of the Iraqi military Abu Mahdi Muhammadise on 3 January.
Iran then burned on the base of Iraq on January 8, where Americans operate, the amount of rockets.
The United States admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran as its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyjahu to be the main opponent of the international nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, which Iran is denying.
TPCA's car has extended its production option, now until 25 May.
Collin car Toyota Peugeot Citroën Carmobile (TPCA) has re-instated the withdrawal of production due to coronavir.
Production lines should start again on Monday 25 May morning.
The course will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said the spokesperson by Tomáš Paroubek.
Production is due to the coronavir pandemic since the evening of March 18th.
Originally, the company intended to renew it on Monday 18 May.
According to Paroubka, closed borders and closed dealership, cars have no business selling.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is affected by the key markets of the company, such as Italy, United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (change for Kolín) said that the withdrawal of production in TPCA was not signed for life in the city.
- From the beginning it was known, it was empty in the city.
But the streets are gradually filled, especially from Monday, when it got a lot angry.
So the city is full,” Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications or foreign workers who stayed at the hostel.
“In those two months we had to deal with almost no problem,” Kašpar said.
For example, the youth's Škoda Auto, which also interrupted production due to the Coravir crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither one of the races works for 100 percent of capacity.
The restoration of production in Scotland accompanied more than 80 hygiene measures.
On Monday night, on Tuesday, Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny first held a third, i.e. night shift after the restoration of production.
In TPCA, about 2500 people are currently working and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also employers in Cologne.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to her family
For more than two years, she struggled with pronouncing Gemma Sisson's cancer, and when she seemed to have beaten cancer, the disease heard again.
A 19 - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospital bed where she could still marry her life - love.
I'm afraid the disease has failed.
A few hours after she died, a shocking message appeared on her social network account for the closest.
Gemma Sisson, from England, loved bodybuilding.
With a friend of Ricky Moore who lived with more than 16 years, they traveled around the world.
A 19-year-old woman sported and lived healthy, yet in April in 2018, cancer was diagnosed.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to get better.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma was able to win cancer, but in August 2019, cancer returned and this time the spine attacked.
A culture and a personal trainer, according to the British daily Daily Mirror, has undergone a 10-hour surgery of the spine and then again began with a drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was in vain.
At the beginning of this year, on her ninth birthday, the doctors told her she had a few months left.
Finally, in April, a handsome blonde decided to enter a hospital in Leeds, where she was visited at any moment by her family who even organized her wedding with her love Ricky.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma to their two-month anniversary to the restaurant.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after she died, there was a contribution on her social network account that Gima wrote for her family.
“If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I'm gonna have a broken heart that I'm leaving my loved ones here, I'm so happy to get rid of what caused me to do.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who was on my side all along and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,\" wrote on the social network, saying that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
“I am also grateful for all the support that I have gained from all my social networks,” she wrote that everyone should appreciate their lives and live in full.
Machines for art sell street dating cards, fungus amulets and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the surrounding pocket works of mostly starting Czech artists will be won.
Pictures and other productions create directly for artmat, so they know that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 per centimetre.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
“In the package there is always a probationary text about artists and then the work itself,” stressed the curator of the Petr Widžová project.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
So the buyer can let him surprise what art he gets.
It can now become a new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexander Cosplová or minispects from Terez Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutch prepared a pexeso associated with the walk of Prague.
The cards need to be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chomová sells the pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artist offers a protective amulet from the troudt and the incarnation card, the second series of illustrations from her Spiritist comic book.
Health fees will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
The greater increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Pay in health care next year could increase by not more than five percent, said the Minister for Health, Adam Vojtěch (after ANO) in Václav Moravce's questions on Czech TV.
The requirement of union workers to increase up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-permanent in ensuring protective assistance.
The hospital says they have their supplies now.
“I think that the increase (payments) could be about five percent,” said the Minister.
According to him, the current situation has to be reviewed when it has hit the selection of coronavir insurance pandemics and government rules against its spread since March.
Insurance income dropped at that time.
“I have a 15 percent increase at this moment unrealistic,” said Vojtěch.
The average monthly income of a physician in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) is likely to reach CZK 88 312 this year, sisters 47 498.
The difference between the salary of the nurse in state hospitals and the wage for other founders will be up to CZK 7 000.
It also shows that the loss of medical nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 CZK in 2019.
The representatives of the experts have already stated in June that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and sisters in state hospitals, which must be followed by payment tables and contractual wages in hospitals, countries or private areas.
They therefore also require that they are uniform for health professionals.
At the health nurse this year, there will be a difference of up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, doctors grew faster than pay last year.
According to the President of the Czech dental chamber Roman Šmucler, the union should understand how it is currently being held.
The House recently approved an increase in the deficit of the state budget for record CZK 500 billion due to the impact of the Covid epidemic, including 1.75 billion to be paid to health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health Providers, according to Šmucler, disagrees with the full increase in wages next year.
According to him, remuneration should be decided by the hospital itself and by medical devices and money should go through the payment decree.
Vojtěch also stated that the hospitals currently have a lot of protective aid.
President of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have one protection aid in property.
He's waiting to complete the selection procedure.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sustainable as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
Aggravating smart quarantine could take over soldiers.
We're ready, they're sending.
-The quarantine is working, of course, is what to improve.
We're going to discuss the military tonight.
The military works perfectly and it is a question that they should not follow all of this again,” said the Prime Minister on his Facebook show, Hey people.
According to him, IT systems and sanitary stations are not sufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were said by the Prime Minister in Moravia, where there are one of the current outbreaks of epidemics.
Mr. Jan Pejšek for ČTK said that information on Sunday negotiations was not available and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step.
Smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine led the 90th central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government, led by former Minister Roman Prymula.
Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized the Dring project on Sunday.
He also said that the army could take him again.
The shortcomings in the project have previously been committed by a government agent for IT and digitalization of Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
The system's working, but it's still working on it.
Twenty years, it was created separately and unsystemically, now we're trying to unite it within a few months.
It's not a trick.
The people behind the march, the poor on the hygiene for the march adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes,” he said.
The Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, namely, he does not want to ‘melt in politics’
The current Australian Mayor Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason for this is the effort to avoid getting lost in politics,” said the Respekt.cz server.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO Presidency, is the prime minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, ANO was elected in Ostrava for almost a third of voting votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in function for only four years.
“I thought that I would last one term of office and with that business experience I could turn everything around and put it on my feet during that time,” said the Conspect.
He added that for the second term of office, he had to make some excuses.
But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be stupid in that policy,” Macura added, who, in his interview, referred himself to himself as a heavy introvert, who doesn't fit for frequent contact with people.
According to the Conspect, it's been speculating about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement for a long time.
The server reminds us that Macura criticized the ANO movement several times, for example, the alliance with the SPD movement or the support of Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few figures, ANO supported in the election of Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš.
From the movement of ANO, which he entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
“If I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a very vain struggle and that no one will call me in, I have no immediate motive to end it,” said the Conspect.
Six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the Australian Mayor in 2014, Macura operated, among other things, as the director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He's been in office with other companies, too.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
By the end of July, Uber will return to Brno, which offers transport services.
It is the result of the amendment of the law, he stated on Thursday in the press release of Council of Brno for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
The Ubers protested in Brno, pointing out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as taxis or taxi meters.
However, as of July, the conditions for running normal taxis and alternative ones have changed.
Kratochwil has had several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
On their basis, the company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is the consequence of a change in the law which allows the company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits,” Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
The cab drivers tested against him for non-marking vehicles as a taxi or a missing cabameter.
The Court of First Instance issued a preliminary measure which prohibited Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported the taxi driver, last year, but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to the court decisions later, Uber could have been driving in Brno, but the company didn't use it.
He will now return on the basis of the amendment of the law.
Since July, a classic taxi with a lamp and a cabameter can be operated more easily by means of a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications.
Too bujara party in Brno: the flying chair fell feet away from the man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor of the apartment, she flew out on Saturday night in Brno's office chair and fell about a meter away from the sidewalk.
A walker came after him at that point, who immediately called the guards.
The patrol immediately saw an open window under which a chair was still lying, along with several backpacks and bats, on its arrival at a given address in the western part of the city.
“The RU that took place in the fourth floor of the room indicated that there was a rather loud party happening inside.
The guards went out to the apartment after the hall and asked three young men present from the age of six to twenty-nine years of explanation, said Mr. James Ghan.
Request for appeal Rafaje will discuss Babiš with ČSSD
The Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) is planning on Monday with the coalition social Democrats to discuss the request for a motion for appeal to the Head of Anti-Monopolitan Office (ÚOHS) by Petr Rafael.
In order to appeal, Rafael called on the non-profit organisations to act as anti-corruption councils of the government, as well as the Ustecky Region.
Social Democrats point out that the exchange at the head of the Office is on site.
According to information from ČTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of the next year, according to the law, the third time cannot be appointed.
His appeal is with President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenges of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the City Region.
Among other things, Rafaj's bail should be the reason for the last time.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to express his view of the fact that the materials will be met and that the government will take a view on this.
He also pointed out that he did not deal with the President so far, that he had no agreement with him at the nearest time.
According to ÚOHS' statement, there's no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not accused of anything.
IHNED.cz servers and currently.cz wrote last week that police are interested in Rafai's meetings with the captain Jiří Kunek.
The meetings have put in connection, among other things, with the decision to compete for a project of controversial new Green Hospital for eight billion, which the Czech Republic has spent hard on.
The meeting was awarded, according to him, to the extent that they jointly dealt with his “sensent activities”,
That's what Rafai is talking about.
The representative of the City Region to appeal to Rafael called on the government at the end of June.
He also asks for reform of decision-making mechanisms by the Authority.
The decision of the ÚOHS on public procurement by the Deputy Chairman for Transport of Jaroslav Kotinek is not transparent and it has a symbol of a representative.
Last March, the police arrested an anti-monopolic office for a tot selection of myths.
This June, the server currently noted.cz that Rafaj uses flats written on the company of a powerful server player ČSSD Alexander Chuba.
But the deposit of 3.5 million on the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been President of the Competition Protection Office since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office of the President of the former Social Democracy Committee appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year mandate will expire.
The anti-monopolitan law states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on the proposal of the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not perform a function for more than six months, or infringes the dignity of its function or independence and impartiality.
In the blanne library, there were workers collapsing in the mountains.
Air conditioning will help
The new technique will cost 740 000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
It's good news to me.
With three children, we go to a library in the centre of Blanska regularly.
In the warm months, however, there was virtually no delay.
There was a terrible heat and a bad air.
Winding didn't help.
That's why I liked the air conditioning,” said one of Petr Novotný's blanish readers.
According to the director of the library, Luke Propy's temperature in the building has often reached over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the object is glassed, and in sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
In addition, thanks to the curve of the building, the sun is leaning on a large part of the day.
At the same time, there is a big problem of developing individual departments, because during the night they must be closed for security reasons.
We often have this from morning to thirty degrees in the library,\" said Propa.
The best part was a study and a reading on the third floor.
And a floor high then the exhibition room and the director.
The uncomfortable climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
“Sometimes it happened that the librarians at work were collapsing and ending up in the inability to work.
The problem has also been regularly found in the cultural room in lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes there was no longer a breath, he noted Propa.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to make air conditioning in all the premises of the library this year.
In the end, there'll only be three circuits out of five.
“With limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most common space.
The studio and the counting on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and the children's department had a level of level,\" said Jiří Svoboda from the Brno Investment Department.
He added that in the first stage workers had already installed air engineering in the autumn and adjusted the wiring.
About 360 thousand crowns.
The City Library of Blansko has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
That's about nine to fifteen years old.
Opora Chicaga banished the corravirus.
Crawford is going back to the game
Not every one of the infected athletes will come out with the truth.
Especially when it's a player from the NHL who is silent about the health status of players as a grave and does not publish anything.
As one of the few, he stepped out of Crawford's line.
A five-year-old native from Montréal was present only at the first training, since then missing in the lineup.
“I would like to announce to you all that I was positively tested at the Covid-19 and for this I spent the last 14 days closed in my house,” he declared his absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his condition anymore.
Crawford's ready to break into full load again.
- It's amazing I'm back.
I'm going to do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible, - to fill in.
The tried goalman got with Chicage two Stanley Cups, the solid part of the brandy is already the tenth season in a row.

Thousands of people protested against the Prime Minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjah solves the Corravir crisis.
Manifestation took place, among other things, in front of Netanjahu's private villa in Caesarare, near its official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
The protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants demand Netanjahu resignation because of the process in which it is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because the government solves another wave of Coravir epidemic.
“Bibi, go home,” wrote one of the demonstrators according to the AP on his banner, referring to Netanyahu’s generally known nickname.
“All of them see that the emperor lost his dress,” it was on another one.
The seven - year - old Netanjahu is the first Prime Minister of Israel to carry out his duties.
The defendant is charged with three corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
All charges are rejected, and they are referred to as chasing them on a witch.
According to the local media, the process can take up to three years, more than 300 Witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, which has about nine million inhabitants in Israel, confirmed 60.500 people.
455 people died of disease.
The Israeli Government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce the daily rise in infected people.
Following the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, but in particular, the number of infected numbers began to grow significantly again by the end of June.
Netanjahu's criticism claims that the government has not helped, for example, workers affected by quarantine measures.
The protestors also hesitate that the government, in the framework of the fight against the Coravir, is giving rise to cross-border instructions.

Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and betting on sustainability
The Czech brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and make a fundamental change in the strategy.
The discounted discounts, and he no longer wants to snort one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the largest environmental pollutants is no news.
There are billions of clothes that end up in the exhausts and dumps every year.
The view of the low fashion, often the proposed approach to dressing, but has changed quite quickly over the past few years.
Approximately half the goods Pietro Filipi sold at full price.
The other half that sold through the sink doesn't simply buy.
The company does not want to baptise one collection after another and at the end of each season, the products are to discount at their production price.
In addition, according to Michal Mika's owner, the time of new and old collections and blind tracking quickly changing fashion trends is gone.
“Most traders with discounts are already counted on the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it's actually kind of a fraud,\" says the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Mika.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on making a large part of our collection composed of so-called bass pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and over-sesonous.
The whole world is a segment of premium marks of absence of any discount typical, the price simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary,” adds Mika.
The giant graphite represents the RAF Kurt Taussiga flyer
\"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the British Royal Air Force series in World War II.
The project liked the city’s leadership,” said Vacek, who finished his work after 14 days of intense creation.
At the same time, it consumed about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, Nazis took him to the boarding camp, where they held him for weeks.
However, thanks to him and his brother, Nicholas Winton managed to avoid concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig got to Great Britain, where he volunteered to enter the Royal Air Force (RAF), and he later completed pilot training in the African South Rhodes and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and the native Teplice, which gave him honorable citizenship.
The six-year-old Kamil Vacek, who people in the street graphic art have known under the nickname of Camo, have been working with spray in the streets for over 20 years.
He started on areas for these purposes, which he set out the former Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) for these purposes.
Hanna's storm arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurikán Hanna arrived at the southwestern coast of the American state of Texas on Saturday afternoon of the local time (before midnight SELČ at night).
He hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, and in his motion over the mainland he was engulfed on a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it is a great danger for the inhabitants of coastal areas.
He brought with him strong winds and intense precipitation; along with local floods, there are reports of electrical failures and various material damage, including damaged ships.
The Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already declared a state of natural disasters on Saturday for 32 periods in the South West Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given by people from the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay bay, but in total it has to hit the territory nearly 500 kilometres before it gradually moves over North Mexico.
“We now have a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous bullets and a unique tornado to present a threat,” warned the U.S. National Center for hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, the storm was moving in the area of the americk-Mexican border and accompanied by a wind of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was driven by winds of up to 145 kilometres per hour, but it gradually broke down to 112 kilometers per hour during a solid procedure, which re-departed Hanna from the hurricane category.
The local authorities called for storms to stop at home and not to forget the health measures associated with the prevention of the spread of Coravir.
Texas belongs to those U.S. states that pandemic disease covid-19 is sulking the most.
In view of the existing security measures and the need to comply with distances are a great challenge and possible evacuation.
The exhibition shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasts.
In the Texas period, Hidalgo was also adapted to one of the buildings as a shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test for the Coravirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated offices to take the bugs and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
We still don't have it much behind us.
We expect disaster floods,\" quoted the AP Chris Birchfield, which works for the National Weather Service (NWS) of Brownsville.
The predictions claim that in some places there could be up to 300 millimetres of precipitation in a few hours, in some cases without 500 millimetres, which together with the rise of sea level could flood a number of seats on the coast.
Zeman will lend the general rank of Colonel Lipkov
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank of Colonel Pavl Lipk at the center.
It's coming from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for renting the rank of the Brig-Gen is the August entrance of Lipka to post representative of the commander of the alliance multinational division of the north-east in Poland.
Lipka is still acting as a representative of the Czech army's ground Commandant.
Zeman's claims at the end of June have been proposed by the government.
Lipka will replace Brig-Gen Karl Řehk from the beginning of August at the position of Deputy Commander of the multinational Northeast division in the Polish Elblag, which commands the units of the alliance presiding presence in the territory of Poland and the Baltic.
In March he became the director of the National Bureau for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The President's government suggested that Lipk lend the rank of the Brig-General.
According to the Professional Military Act, the higher rank of the soldier may be borrowed for the duration of his chosen function or for the duration of the duties required to lend higher rank.
The position of the Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
The soldier whose rank has been borrowed has the same rights and obligations as if he was appointed to this rank.
However, he is not entitled to a payment adjustment which would correspond to that rank.
Prohibition of rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted.
- Colonel Lipka shows high professional preparedness and is a model for the subordinates.
They participate in the implementation of the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of military participation in foreign operations, in June the Ministry of Defence for the proposal for promotion.
The Wednesday promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. in Prague, the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff, Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coravir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for plane travel to help reduce the spread of new Coravir.
It was announced by the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards, compliance with the distance or load of robes on the plane as well as at the airport, the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unsettled.
Reuters reported it.
“I am glad that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards,” said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that they still had to formally approve the Minister.
The measures agreed include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years, to comply with the recommended distance during safety checks and withdrawal at the airport.
In aircraft, enough fresh air must be guaranteed and all information must be available in several languages.
Aerolinka will also be able to plant middle seats.
The common rules on which officials have agreed to meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
At the Arctic Spicberky, the temperature record fell, measured almost 22 degrees there.
“In Longyearbyen, 41 years old record fell,” said the Norwegian meteorological Institute on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsia, which exceeded the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees.
The total of the two-thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicberky, located about 1300 kilometers from the north pole.
Spicberrys are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This is highlighted by the dangers arising from the warming of other Arctic Consequences - from Alaska to Sibiř, the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study last year's report.
The average temperature in Špicberky according to him increased between the 1970s and the 20s by three to five degrees.
By 2100 it can rise by even ten degrees, unless the release of greenhouse gases is reduced into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth can result in freezing land flowing forever, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause even more lavins and soils.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or tulens, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
The British coming back from Spain are waiting for a compulsory two-week quarantine
The British cabin of citizens also called for the risk of spreading the disease to Covid-19 to avoid all routes to mainland Spain which are not necessary.
The Canary Islands and Balearian islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must be in isolation for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
- Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We adopted this decision to prevent possible spread of the virus in Britain,” said the British diplomat in its statement.
“We have always made it clear that if it is necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of the safe ones,” she added.
As the British letter of Metro noted, the latest announcement will reach thousands of British travel plans.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British have concerns, among other things, whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation after their return from the holiday.
For example, Neil Hunter from the city of Sittingbourne ordered a 10-day holiday on Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
They've been ordered since December.
\"We had a whole family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, I don't know what's going to happen after this announcement.
I work as a driver, and I don't think my employer will admit that I will be in quarantine after my return for two weeks, - quoted Metro Hunter's diary.
With regard to Spain there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
In the last two days, over 900 newly infected have always arrived there in 24 hours.
The authorities in some areas have already strengthened the Coravir measures, such as Catalana trying to reduce all nightlife and prevent people from meeting largely.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of disease in Catalan, Aragonia, Basque and Madrid.
The Dukovan electricity purchase model will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss on Monday the electricity purchase model from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The draft law calculates that if the purchase price is higher than the price of the power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference by means of tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the price on the market, the impact on consumers will be reversed.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for customers.
The Vice-President and Minister Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and CEZ's energy company have already said that the more likely option is that people will save the electricity thanks to the construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The focus has already been criticized by environmental organisations.
The purchase price may be both at the market price of the power supply and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact shall be distributed between customers according to the size of the fuse - at a lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption, - indicated in the documents of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO).
Havlíček said in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would grow and people would earn Dukovan.
Otherwise, the impact will be in tens of koruna per year per family, which he believes is much less than every year in invoices for electricity to support so-called supported resources.
He had already estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawattthodin (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, is to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Bank for 2021, which now is the most stocked for traders, is currently around EUR 45 (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
In contrast to the purchase prices and the market prices of the power supply of 10 euros, average households with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could meet the four-member households, standardly equipped with electric appliances, including hot plates and ovens, which, however, do not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - less than 100 CZK/year, have written in the documents for the Government of the MPO.
“We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The Coravir pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a very speculative matter,” said ČTK, the former executive director of the Energy Financial Group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law is based on the fact that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, respectably entrusted to it by the legal person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The agreement between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, even repeated, as long as possible until the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as an electricity production with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with a installed capacity of 100 megawattts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček had previously stated that the new production block should have a power output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawattthodin electricity annually, which would correspond to the decimally expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The funding model of the new Dukovan Block approved the government on Monday.
The state of construction should finance without a year, the operation shall be accounted for with a 2% interest.
With the funding model, the opposition is also concerned with the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid to ČEZ, which will also cover all any additional costs.
Managing Director of CEZ Daniel Beneš in May of the Czech Republic said that the expected sum for the construction of the block in current prices is around six billion euros (around CZK 162 billion).
The agreements between the State and ČEZ on the construction of the new Dukovan Block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry for Local Development has downloaded the material to support tourism in the media for two billion
Material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic two billion crowns, the office of observation procedure has withdrawn.
Minister Klára Dostálová (after ANO) server ListNews.cz said that she was still working on the material.
The document in eKlepu (electronic library of legislative process) pointed out on Friday the server Zpražy.cz.
The Ministry of the plan justified the loss of tourism due to coronavir.
During the Corravir crisis, there was a gap in income and media.
The proposal has created criticism of the opposition and travel representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now in view of the hlidacstat website.cz, the MMR planned to give the CzechTourism travel support money to advertising in televisions, radios, press, internet, billboards or stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would get television.
Most of them would have won a private TV Nova and Prima.
The printed journals and weekly would receive 400 million and the same work would give the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again be private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used on outdoor advertising on billboards, LED images and areas at stations or in metres.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was expected to start in mid August and last a year.
“The material is still working, it is certainly not in a form that should be presented,” said Dostierová without further details of the server Listwork.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of the TOP 09 Markéty Pekarová Adamová, would benefit the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
“I firmly believe that this gloomy contempt will get a punch between the eyes in the fall,” she wrote on the twitter.
Accompanies that it is, in fact, an aid to the media affected by the crisis.
“It may be a coincidence, but I know nothing about media support,” Deci N said Friday.
According to her, the budget is two billion orientations.
Of course, we count on it, it can be less or more.
It's a work material, - she added.
Inicily Zachranňme tourism does not give a media campaign to support home tourism the sense of purpose.
“We want two billions for tourism companies, an unnecessary advertising campaign,” said Tomáš Barčík, on Sunday.
If there are CZK 2 billion in the state budget, companies, not the media, should be guided by an initiative in an open letter to the government.
A life department, a rooster of beer and death as a turret of grass
The postmortem is also the third album titled A Death is the stéblo grass of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erika Frič, who also left the year before, May 24.
In Frič's discography, the fifth item and the same as the previous titles and here is the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is himself an excellent interpretation.
The Frič, the year 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passive through its own personal experience and also very low speeches of faith.
However, he was on a hunt far from some agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, aggressive, totally tolerated.
I find in that connection to Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), masters of prominence.
Frič's album offers records of the 2006 author's reading, but also performances with musicians who have always very sensitively accompanied him, whether it was the cellist Josef Key, or Honza Bartoň and Holata's winner.
I would like to help myself - in the words of the Australian poet Peter Hrušek about Frič long poetic compositions.
“They were proud and endless bitterness, ” writes Hruška, “over the state of our world threatened with destruction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into the vast consumption of vanity and greed, is increasingly giving up what his soul was made of - the secret of faith, humility and human proximity.
In them there was a touch of who knows that the values for which he was created are little interested, but who also knows that only because of the general lack of interest cannot be destroyed.
The poems reminded that a person might have to lose everything expensive, but it's not essential how he lost it.
If he sells himself away from a general fall, sceptically resigns, he will be silent or will remain at the last moment in a calm and proud duration of what he believes and what he loves.
Paroubek isn't my consultant, said Hamok
Former Prime Minister and Chairman Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
President of the Party and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said that on Prime Party TV today.
About the fact that Paroubek should be Haštek's consultant, he informed the server ListNews on Friday.cz.
“We write a text from time to time, he sometimes sends me some material, and I read it,” Hamáček said today.
He added that this was not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
“The fact that sometimes I read his opinion, so many people are,” he said.
In a follow-up discussion with ODS, Jana Černoch's Minister said that many ODS members still have little to listen to Václav Klaus’ views.
He thinks it's okay because it's an experienced policy and former President of the Party, which is also the case with Paroubka.
The fact that the media is making it an affair, it has marked it as a sign of this season of cucumbers.
Server ListNews.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek fulfils the role of Hašek's informal consultant.
He also wrote that, at the fourth place, the candidate of the party in the oral region is headed by a later chairman of Peter Benda's cell, which is connected to Paroubek and served as Vice-President of his side LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that the membership of the candidate will not be commented until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead of us, he's a kick in the ass, running the Swedes challenger
The 22-year-old American tiger has ambitions and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new government.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis by two years younger than that, and last year he's been helping him to have an NCAA association.
“We had a battle a year before, and then he won, and I was the second one, and then we went through it.
In both cases, it was a very good fight,” explains Nilsen, who won by 5.95 metres.
But Duplantis has been shot up since then, and at the very moment, he's been alone in the highest typhoid spheres.
In just twenty years he became a world recordman, this year on February 8th in Toruni overcame a line of 6,17 meters, a week later he added a centimetre.
“He jumped six metres from the age of 18, when he finished high school,” recalls his peer of Nilsen for the World Attek web.
“It was clear that as soon as he grew up with a boy in a man, all his potential and talent defecates.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record, - he thinks.
For Nilsen's record of success is about the knowledge of thinners than the proud Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
So far, he indicated his options at NCAA races, which he regularly won, this year in February, he improved his inner personal record at 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he won to the American World Championship, where he finished 13.
The nearest milestone then, for the first time, is to taste the Diamond League.
“It is my priority to get on a professional circuit and race as much in the Diamond League as possible because you can make a name there,” he realizes.
“If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly also lead to events like Olympic Games, World Championships or pan-American Games”
But because of the pandemic, these top holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and other poles time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, which can easily turn the race under five circles into just a silver fight?
“All are trying to reach him, but I don’t think it will be possible at any time,” Nilsen considers.
- This boy has been jumping for 16 years, and he's been in training for all the other miles -
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he'll want to increase it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of lives of a disabled child who couldn't.
There's a court waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily designed to improve the quality of his life.
A woman has been threatened with prison for less than eight years.
Because of poor health, the court of a sick man had taken away from the sin’s money, and his mother established a caregiver that, among other things, was to manage.
From mid-November 2013 until January this year, a woman used part of the funds from her son’s disability pension for her needs and prepared it by 400,000 crowns,” said Dan Ladman’s police spokesperson, claiming that the accused woman was making it difficult to defend the interests of the injured.
A woman, according to the court's order, had set up an account to her son, but his pension was sent to her account.
After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the health care facility and the payment of the necessary medicines, the remaining funds for the purchase of vehicles, electrical appliances and household operation were used.
That she couldn't use her son's money for her own use, she admitted.
However, she was involved in paying family expenses.
“We had problems with our income to pull the course of the household.
We've never bought anything on our standard.
It was always for things that the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I had committed a crime,” she explained the woman to the police.
She promised her son's money would be back.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, claiming scientists to find tools
The findings from the cave of Chiquihuite in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments from limestone, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointy objects that could serve as a pile of spears or kickers.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here,” said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published in Nature.
The youngest instruments reach 12 500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite cavers, located in a large altitude, lived after 20,000 years.
So far, the generalized theory talked about the fact that the first representatives of Homo sapiens were crossing the mainland bridge from the area of Russia today to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archeological evidence, including unique groats, digs used to kill mothers and other prehistory animals, have shown that this Imperial culture has subsequently spread in a large part of North America.
This model, however, has been given cracks in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in Nature, 42 different sites across North America have shown human presence on the continent since 26,000 to 12,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland before they thought.
Some of them could have gotten to America.
“It is obvious that people have been in America long before the development of so-called customs culture,” said Ruth Gruhnová of the University of Canada, Alberta.
The interest in tickets is so far filled with an optimistic scenario, claims the sellers.
Price reductions are also gradually reduced
The sales of tickets in the Czech Republic grow every week.
Although it is still about half the interest compared to last summer, demand is growing every week up to 20 percent.
Thus, post-crisis development complements the most optimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
The flight prices are also gradually reduced.
The most wanted destination is mainly South European countries, according to salesmen.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At Letuška.cz, the most flights are sold to Croatian Split.
Of other countries, then, the most sought United Kingdom, which has always been one of the most difficult destinations.
Even the average flight price is reduced.
At Letuška.cz portal, about half a month, around 6250 crowns, were less than 3000 crowns each year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices fall even in some European places, such as Spain or Italy, in recent weeks, about five years.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy flights with much less than before, because they fear further development of the Coravir situation.
According to the earlier information Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of tickets before departure decreased by about 10 days each year.
“It confirms the future trend when people will order flights with much less pre-emption, require greater flexibility, less risk,” said Vice President for Kiwi.com Michal Šindelář.
Currently, the average booking period before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airline lines from the Czech Republic is rising.
At Prague airport, regular lines are currently running in more than 60 destinations.
The last summer season is about half of the destination.
Big finale this evening!
Watch the scorpion battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has made it to the great finale.
It presents an experienced nine-year-old Scottish scorpor Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Berg.
Gary Anderson pulled Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the board ladder.
Even with James Wade, however, he dealt with him, and in the quarter of his fight with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home a world one before.
“Following Scotland,” he had a team in his semifinal when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the tomb from the shovel, dominated the extension and after the result 18:16 he fought a place in the final tournament, which he had already held in 2018 when Mensura Suljovič defeated 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Berg.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
The six-year-old scorpionist first surprisedly shut down the world's six Nathan Aspinalla, pushed Jo Cullen into a dramatic battle, and in the fourth year after the sharp start Adrian Lewis also failed.
It was a semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the introduction, but in the calm playing Belgians, he received a unique series of lead, which then more or less he kept up to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high skinnings, which he exposed to an occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coravir cases have occurred at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new Coravirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15 212 people have proved to be infected.
Almost 9 600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5 254 people are sick.
It's made up of data on the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of new confirmed cases this week has exceeded four times each other's two hundred.
Maxim was the fifth 281 cases.
On Thursday, there was a positive 235 tested, a day earlier than 246, and on Tuesday 206.
In the first working day of this week, 169 infected have arrived.
9 590 people have been cured from Covid-19 in the Czech Republic, i.e. 63 percent of all who have been infected.
Most have had mild course of disease.
In the hospital, according to the latest data from the Department of Health 151 people with Corravir, 19 of which evaluates doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of disease covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days in the conversion to 100,000 inhabitants still show Karvinsko, almost 59.
It follows the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frydecko-School with 36 infected inhabitants per 100 thousand in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people in the Czech Republic since Saturday, new measures against the spread of coronavir apply.
People must wear bugs at internal mass events over 100 people, it is about cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited from the current thousands of people to half.
In the world, the number of people who proved to have been infected with a new Corravir has crossed the 16 million threshold.
It was introduced by John Hopkins' U.S. University of America, which has been monitoring pandemics globally.
According to this source, the victim's balance sheet, which died with covid-19 disease, is approaching 645 thousand.
The latest million infected were added to statistics for just three days; the limit fell on July 15 million.
The largest share in rapid increases in the number of cases has had over 4.1 million people already registered in the United States, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where almost 1.4 million people have been ordered by the authorities.
The infected are now at a record rate.
The World Health Organization has announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have taken place worldwide from Thursday to Friday, which is the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the peak in people's countries like the USA, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has grown in almost 40 countries around the world over the last week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The evidence has already appeared in almost all the countries of the world, the first case today has been officially announced by the KDR.
The air in the households is five times worse than the outdoors.
Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only the poor quality of air in the outdoors but also at home.
She warned Israel’s human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted the journal The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, which was deserved to be the creation of an Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on household harmfulness right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the American Environmental Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that early 3.8 million people die due to bad air quality in their homes.
“As a result of the Coravir epidemic, which has forced many people to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households,” said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, the quality of the domestic air is almost none of them.
Dangerous may be things with which a person normally comes into contact - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
“One gas also gives out clothes that we regularly wear in the dry cleaner,” said Abraham.
In fact, children, older household members, and people with respiratory problems are most threatened.
Other health individuals may start to suffer problems such as headache, fainting, irritability of the nose, bleeding from the nose, vomiting or skin allergy.
In long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all harmful things come from objects inside the household, the source may also be material from which houses are built.

It's hard to say what they did, but, according to Dominika, the dispute began sometimes in the mid - 1990s.
“The father, after the revolution, stated that he had made it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in his drawer at the time, but if he had any kind of heat, he had an end with his career,” Gott says.
