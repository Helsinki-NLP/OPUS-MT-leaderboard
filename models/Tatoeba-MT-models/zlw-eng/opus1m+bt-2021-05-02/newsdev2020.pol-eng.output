Bosnia and Herzegovina protests to Croatia's plans for radioactive waste storage
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the north-west of Bosnia in protest against Croatia's neighbouring plans for the storage of part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for natural beauty.
The demonstrators in the Bosenian settlement of Novi Grad requested Croatia to reject plans to build waste storage facilities in former military baskets in Trgovska Gora and declared a struggle with the project.
There would be waste from Krško's nuclear power plant in the facility.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, holding banners with “I want a healthy future,” and “Stop - (Rion) Una needs us - said that the radioactive waste composition could threaten the Union’s river and the life of about 250 000 inhabitants.
We have to say NO,
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljac, Mayor of Novi Grad.
We need to fight to protect our life and our Una.
In Slovenia, the Krško plant built in the 1980s also belongs to Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional waste disposals.
The HRT television company submitted on Friday that in Croatia it was not decided whether to build waste alone or to pay for the storage of parts of the waste in a new facility designed by Slovenia.
The Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from each party existing in the ethnic divide country insisted that Croatia find another location in the part of the country closer to the power plant.
“Why Croatia throughout her area claims that Trgovska Gora is the best place in Bosnia,” Drljac asked.
We can't let them down!

The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The US Congress for the statutory 15 days following the adoption by the State Department of possible purchase by Poland of 32 multi-stakeholder F-35 did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition had been fulfilled before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The decision of Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
\"After promoting sales by the State Department, and now through Congress, I see no more serious obstacles,\" said John V. Venable, Senior Council on Defence Policy of Washington, conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that, on the basis of the Broni Export Control Act 1976, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify the Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad for 15 days before signing the agreement if the value of such a transaction is to be sold to NATO Member State, more than 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion lower. This amount includes technical and logistics costs, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft - if this transaction is ultimately completed - will be the American Lockheed Martin arms company, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for the F-35A company Pratt and Whitney fighters.
The proposals for buying American fighters fifth generation F-35 on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak in May.
Poland’s offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy and President Donald Trump at the White House.
For the implementation of this agreement, if finalised, representatives of the Pentagon will be monitored under the Militar Sales Foreign Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired the Patriot Anti-shipry system.
The price of one fighter F-35 at the time that Poland offered a purchase was, without weapons and technical assistance, about 89.2 million dol.
As the PSP informed the American military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, such a price was given in the preliminary negotiations “the maximum price was much higher than the price to be negotiated”
“The prices fall rapidly, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars lower than the cost of Eurofighter, which has no advantage as F-35, indicated Venable.
PAP spokespersons expressed their hope that the final negotiations on the purchase of US fighters by Poland would end this year.
The potential participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction, i.e. offset, will be discussed directly with US producers of fighters F-35.

Nigeria: Police raid for schools in Kaduna, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna, a State Police Officer in Kadun, held a raid last night at Imamhamad Bn Hambal, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi, and evacuated seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police said that the children were in highly dehumanized conditions, and the school authorities deny this claim.
“ They don’t tell the truth because all children were there with the consent of their parents.
Before taking children to school, parents signed a form.
My parents brought food to their children every day, and they knew the conditions.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as by removing all the food of the students delivered by the parents before the school was closed.
It's not fair, because parents can testify whether their children are under bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that former Police Commissioner Abdulrahman, who once visited school to check out the level of care for children, had never had any objections.
He said that children were studying Koran and nothing else.
However, the Public Relations Police Officer, Yakubu Sabo, considered that they would join their parents after passing the state government.
‘It is in dehumanising conditions on behalf of the subcontracting or acquisition of corrective knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their back, which proves to be a bit of a fight.
That's why we're studying school to get to know her owner, he added.

Rachel Rommeswinkel from the U.S. began her career as a natural blogger in Dongguan and has over a million fans in Bilibi and Weibo.
She said she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her videos.
Leticia de Lassus from France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI headquarters in Guangzhou agrees that “the education of children is like wearing jackets.
If you don't actually turn your first button on, the rest will never go to their right place.
The American of Chinese origin Henry Xiao considers that, in the very centre of the GBA area, its company can benefit from many privileges with regard to new principles, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talent.
The producers of the culinary “Nanta Show” program, Sean Choi, South Korea, said that the cuisine of Guangdong region is known worldwide and the introduction of the “Nanta Show” programme was a good decision in Guangdong.

Simoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
“I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda, says Thomas Siemoniak.
Vice-President of the Civil Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in his conversation with Polsat News spoke about the affair with the head of the NIK.
\"This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become a minister of culture from some kind of entertainment, not the head of the NI or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who is responsible for billions of taxes, he said.
\"This is a very serious crisis,\" he added.
Siemoniak also talked about Klaus Jachira's candidate.
“There is Antoni Macieturewicz on the PiS lists.
A man who didn't just say things, he was just doing it.
He judged former SKW heads of espionage for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why does no one call for Antonie Macierewicz to be on the list, he asked.
“ People from us have other aesthetics.
I think that Jachira, who has already apologized for one of the things, also feels that sometimes she's exaggerating.
Let us not make this a campaign problem - he added.

“The forest - masked rapist of the children of Central Coast forced to look at their victim in court
Dressed in a masking outfit, a man grabbed a 12-year-old from behind school and dragged it into a dense rosary in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Soon after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers held a number of important investigations to his subjects.
The male admitted to the guilt of seven assault charges and three further cases relating to the rape and sexual exploitation of another girl, at the age of 11, between August 2016 and August 2017.
A 12-year-old victim was walking along the path, and when she looked behind her, she saw him suddenly leaving the bushes armed in a big branch and a knife.
When she begged “stop, stop, stop, stop,” he captured her behind the neck and forced her into the mouth.
The man said: “Be quiet, don’t scream.
Don't yell because I have to hurt you.
Holding a knife in her right hand, tied her hands and legs with cables, and then tied it to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man reached work about 9:30 without responding to several texts and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and carried traces of grass and trees, and he himself claimed that he was involved in an accident involving a rage attack on the road, during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell from a patch.
There will be a further trial for the decommissioning man on Tuesday.
The Pope calls for executives of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned executives of technological firms, diplomats and financiers that, with the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievements, there is a risk of increasing social inequalities if, in the course of its ethics, it does not take into account the common good.
Pope Francis published these words during the Vatican conference, where the government's messengers and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference entitled \"The Common Good in the Digital Age\"
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in taking part in the debate on the perspectives and threats associated with artificial intelligence.
They discussed technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work in which machinery will play an increasingly important role, as well as a study of the case researcher in New Zealand's castles and decisions taken by social media owners in connection with the spread of the mass recording film.
During the speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that due to machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution, dangerous workers and monotonous work were saved.
He warned, however, that the increasingly frequent dependence on working equipment to achieve profits is the risk of depriving people of dignity from work.
\"If technological progress were to be caused by increasingly visible inequalities, this would not be real and real,\" he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind would be an enemy of the good in common, it would lead to an adverse retroactive return to some kind of barbarism under the law of the strongest.
The organizers of the conference expressed their hope to benefit from the expertise of the participants and to identify possible future advisers of the Catholic Church in high-tech matters.
Martin Odegaard, a rental player from Real Madrid, puts fans in euphoria with its powerful asist.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assist at the opening of Mikel Oyarzabal's goal.
Winning 2:0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbs to the top of the La League table and continues to pass on to be inconceivable on its own field this year.

Vinis Junior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in a band.
However, the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Society, has caused great interference, including the incredible assist in La Ligi.
During his meeting with the Real Society of Alaves Martin Odegaard, he performed an impressive assist at the opening goal of Mikela Oyarzabal and Real Society eventually won 3:0 before his own audience.
After taking the ball from the right side, Martin Odegaard made a player out of the opposite team, setting him up a net, and then he sent an amazing pass on the centimetres between two other players and his teammates, just to set his leg.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third in the performance of the incredible Oyarzabal, this time with the penalty line, has provided a decisive victory for the Imanola sub-oper before Manu Garcia was sent from the field five minutes before the game ends.
Martin Odegaard joined the Reala Madrid only as a 16-year-old in 2015 but had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to be on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of Sharad Pawar's name on fraud about the State Cooperative Bank Maharashtra
Anna Hazare said: “The name of Sharad Pawar did not appear on the list when I was told to do this.
The social worker, Anna Havare, did not surprise the fact that the name of Sharad Pawar, the president of the Nationalist Congress Party, appeared in connection with multi-million dollar fraud at the Maharashtra State Bank.

“ED will find out where his name appeared on the case,” said Anna Hasare, a multiple participant in the manifestion against corruption.
Sharad Pawar contradicts the admission of criminal action and claims that he was in no way linked to the bank, and puts the fact that the case was filed for several weeks before the March 21st election of the March Assembly.
Former Minister of the Union assured that it would not legally be the property of Delhi, clearly referring to the central government headed by the BJP party.
The NCP has assessed the matter of the Executive Director as politically motivated.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisor in connection with the close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The IIPC's independent office of police proceedings will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the Prime Minister, whether in the course of public administration as mayor of London an abuse of criminal offences has been committed.
The General Court of Great London (GLA) announced in its statement that its supervisory inspector registered “the Commission’s request for a preliminary ruling on the preferential treatment of Arcuri resulting from their close knowledge.
‘The ‘action-related question’ may be spoken when the information arises indicating the possibility to commit a crime,’ he said.
It doesn't mean that somehow it's proven.
The IOPC will consider now whether it is necessary to examine this case.
The question is addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police members in England and Wales.
It was assigned to that police supervisor because Johnson then held a position as an equivalent to the police Commissioner and the Commissioner for Criminal Affairs.
Johnson denied, as though his close relationship with Arcuri had no irregularities.
Previously, he said that he would apply to the London City Council Order and give details of his relations with Arcuri, but he insisted that the board “has been working on the wrong problem. ”
The charge is the result of the report “The Sunday Times, that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received £166,000 from the budget money, and privileged access to three foreign trading missions, which were then mayor Johnson.
As a result, the government until the case was examined, the grant amounted to £100 000 per Arcuri owned by Hacker House.
The government expects troublesome questions about the verification procedure carried out prior to the grant of funds.
The Minister for Numbering Matt Warman said in Izbie Gmin that the employees of his department “lawfully maintained their due care - and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the calls to the number were transferred to the California office, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is currently going to live.
The close relationship between the Prime Minister and the businesswoman “was a secret to the staff of the polyszynela,
GLA's decision to address the Prime Minister's case to the IIPC independent police office met with dissatisfiedness at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of higher rank, the government’s representative is ‘politically motivated, and its term, on the preceding day of the Conservatory Party conference, is ‘politically political’.
“The supervisory inspector has not provided any evidence of the claims and the prime minister has not received an opportunity to reply to him before the release of the press release last night on Friday,” states the source.
Neither the citizens nor the media can be drawn into such a purely political law.
Today, in the previous hours, “The Standard” journalists were told that Johnson’s close relationship with a businesswoman from California, which helped the tourism and promotion agency in London, was “the secret of the police“.
The employees of London & Partners (L&P) recalled that Arcuri received places during Johnson’s foreign trade trips as mayor despite the fact that they were not considered “faithable” at that time.
Third defendant for drug crimes in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Following the last year's death of the Mac Miller rapper as a result of drug overdose, third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to the court documents, Stephen Walter was suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills fixed by fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, or a strong opioid responsible for ‘epidemia’, which absorbed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter's accusing himself of delivering pills that another man Cameron Petit sold to Miller.
The court records sealed on Tuesday reveal that Petit was receiving drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who had been arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, was suspected to play “the son of a bitch, Walter, who supplied the pills to Petit.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did either of them present the line of defence in his case.
Walter, subject to a conditional exemption on drugs in 2005, is in custody and has also already been convicted of a sentence of imprisonment for five months for breach of the conditions of exemption.
The complainants in charge of the case, which was the first to be referred to on Thursday, on the website dedicated to the TMZ celebrity, demand Walter to remain in custody in anticipation of the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape of the defendant.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's automatic secretary didn't come right away.
Petit's case was filed in federal court on 4 September, and his defender refused to comment.
The words of Miller's rhyming works are genuine conversations about his depression and drug use, so that he gained fans from the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who really was named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years he remained in connection with singer Ariana Grande earlier completed in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a moving film involving Miller and the song “Thank U Next,” which mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been associated with the abuse of opioids in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, 3 Doors Down guitarist, also died from an overdose in 2016, and in his body the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone was observed.
This article introduced a change: the correct writing of Walter’s name “Stephen” rather than “Steven”
Nine-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 mobile games
9-year-old creates a game of play in a hideable game using a free Scratch 2 software application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basel has generated more than 30 mobile games.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player wins the point every time he catches the bat who comes out of the safe house.
I learned how to make games on a fast course.
\"Now I create them when I get bored,\" said Basel CNN.
In March, Dad wrote it for a five-day accelerated course for children aged between 5 and 15 years.
The course, organized by the Codefest International, was intended to provide children with access to new technologies such as the robot and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Bashil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“ When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always caught a phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run,” said father CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and received a bea for spending all the time on the game.
“ One day he played the tablet, as usual, and he was so absorbed that I was upset,” said his father.
From anger, I said, “you only play hard, or you can’t think about creating your own games so that others can play them“.
Speaking of which, I was upset and I didn't think he'd take it seriously - he added it.
From that time on, Basel has shown an active interest in learning his own games, imploding his parents to buy a laptop and saving him on a course where he met the basis for creating the game.
The Basel, which in the future wants to be a scientist, gives itsgrom titles based on their content.
One of his games, “Mosquito mash” is available in Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basel, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been famous for using codes to create robots that separate their work at home.
In May, the Akrocot team from the middle female school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for playing box.
And thanks to the growing investments of giants in technology like Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basel and its peers are on a good way to the career of coders.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina confesses to a lie about corruption
The court documents submitted on Friday show that former president of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating corruption of the main political donors.
According to the volunteer, Robin Hayes is supposed to plead guilty next Wednesday.
From a document containing the actual basis prepared under the defense agreement and signed by lawyer Hayes, Hayes found that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The attorney's agreement has been sealed, and from the facts, it is not clear that Hayes's charges will come true.
At first, he was charged with amalgamation, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of taking part in the plan of the insurance company's management plan for campaigning to the main in the insurance market regulator country in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates were accused of trying to bribe Mike Causeya's state insurance officer.
Lindberg is the founder of a insurance and investment company, which has been one of the main state-owned political donors in recent years, which has provided over $5 million national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and politicians of the Republic’s Party, but he also transferred data to the Democrats.
His lawyer didn't reply to a Friday e-mail with a comment request.
The Defense Officer Hayes Kearns Davis did not reply on Friday's e-mail with a request for comment.
From Friday's court documents, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Causey about the staff of the State Insurance Department.
In line with the document on the actual basis of Hayes, he actually spoke with the Commissioner for Insurance about Lindberg's request to make changes to the staff employed by the market controller.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg arrange a meeting with Causey and that he spoke about the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April act of the charge, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to Causeya's relaunch in 2020.
The contested act shows that the request for amendment of the department's official, which was controlled by Lindberg, has also been made.
The Republican Causey reported a alleged attempt to corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence of the case.
No charges were made for him.
According to Lindberg's accusation act, he ordered Hayes to pay $25,000 to Causeya's campaign when they were also present in Lindberg and Causey.
During Hayes’ conversation, he initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such amount of money would attract attention, but, as a result of the accusation, he finally resolved.
“ Whatever you want to do, we will do,” said Hayes, according to the prosecution note.
\"All right, I'll take care of it.\"
The Federal Attorney's spokesperson did not reply to an e-mail with a request for further information on the settlement.

He came to Szczecin to vote on the counsellor Dariusz Matecki, a candidate for Sejm from the list of Law and Justice.
\"The program of good change is to implement the Polish version of prosperity strategy,\" said the Minister.

Our government has consistently implemented a program that has committed itself four years ago.
We said we'd put in a 500 plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Eve Kopcz said it's impossible that this money just isn't there.
We proved that money was and was, but the PO didn’t care about the ones they were supposed to go to--
Ziobro also reminded of the expedition to children and the 13th retirement - and that there is also a retirement plan for fourteen.
In addition to the ‘serious distribution of national income’, PiS priorities are a fair state and economic development.

Facebook with concern for the well-being of users will hide on the sample of the Likers counter
In the first time in the world, an experiment aimed at improving the well-being of users, some of those using Facebook will soon not see the number of likes, reactions and video views.
The likeness will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, the Facebook Privacy Director in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on well-being and opinions from mental health professionals indicating that the Liker can refer to comparisons with others.
“A number of cracking groups, as well as mental health organisations, have been really positive,” said Garlick.
The elimination of this numerator will make people focus on the quality of their interaction and the quality of content rather than on the number of likes or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more attractive and will not be taken as rivalry,” she said.
Garlick assured that companies based on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations to which they had access to.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as it took place with Instagram, when the test was given to Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment is completed and whether the change will be introduced permanently.
\"The initial comments of users on the new principles in Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to the opinion,\" she said.
Speaking of the place of global experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically recognized Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that will provide us with reliable opinions indicating whether the new experience is valuable to those who use our services or not.
Czestochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims
For the moment, often, the curia does not comment on the appeal of counsellors to that metropolis of Wacław Depo on the transfer of financial compensation for the maintenance of the waste management in the pilgrimage season.
The city requests 1 zł from the pilgrim.
On Friday at the press conference, he spoke about the speech directed at Spring Robert Bedron, a leading leader in the Jasna Góra of Częstochowska, the First Virgin Mary, Vice-President of that town council and candidate for Sejm Łukasz Kot.
Kot informed that the day before, the councillors of the SLD announced the appeal to Wacław Depo for the transfer of one golden town from every visitor to the Częstochowa pilgrimage - to support the work of urban, municipal, etc.
We have accepted the appeal to Depo's archibishop to help the city, to help us clean up the pilgrims, to prepare the city for the pilgrims.
“We ask to transfer symbolic gold from each pilgrim to the budget of the city.
This city will be able to give them better living conditions in Czestochów, said Vice-President of the City Council.
Asked for comment, Mr. Mariusz Bakalz initially prepared a few reports, but then asked, as he indicated, at the order of abp. Depo, to replace it with information about the content: “We do not refer to the matter until the official position of the city council is received.
According to the project, a call for abpa Depo’s abpa concerns “the transfer of financial compensation to the city of Czestochowa for the maintenance of the municipal waste management system during the period of the pilgrimage season”
\"As a result of the increasing number of arrivals to the Czestochna pilgrims and the cost of operating the municipal waste management system during the period of the pilgrimage season, in view of the image of the city among the inhabitants and residents, loops and loops, we want to take care of our common good, the small country of Czestochowa, to propose participation in the cost of handling the waste system, which is a fragment of the apel.
“In order to maintain the cleanness of the pedestrian-country tractors, which are moving through the pilgrims, using simultaneously with small infrastructure, i.e. the external basket on the waste, we offer symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system of 1 zł from the pilgrim, written.
\"In addition, in connection with the participation in annual costs, which the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the cleanness and aesthetics of the urban space, and also wanting to stress that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be allocated to improve tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available, they declared counsellors.
They pointed out that, in addition to financial issues, their proposal is based on many reservations raised by the residents regarding the purity of the trails that are moving through the pilgrims.
\"With regard to the purity of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of Cities calls on the Archibishop of the capital city of Wacław Depo to transfer financial compensation to the city of Czestochowa for the maintenance of municipal waste management during the period of the pilgrimage season - again in the appeal.

“The knowledge of TVP has left the Confederate when describing the survey
According to a study by Pollster, in the elections to Sejm PiS, 45% of the votes, KO 26%, Lewis 14%, PSL 7%, and the Confederation 5%.
The election threshold was even described on the Super Express portal for which the probe was carried out.
In the main edition of “Awareness”, describing the same survey, only four first parties were presented, completely tackling the Confederate.
According to Edyta Lewandowska, only four committees crossed the electoral threshold and would enter the country.
The TVP has also demonstrated the division of the mandates without taking into account the votes cast in the Confederate.
It would give the PiS its own governments.
Krzysztof Bosak, in his comment on the whole situation, spoke of “public compromise on the question of honesty towards society,”
“They started with a word of “moral revolution”,” he recalled and stated that this matter was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki also wrote on Twitter that “the TVP’s knowledge” in subsequent actions against the Confederation shame Urbana and Michnik.
He also drew attention to the lack of right-wing reactions by journalists.
“ But let us also look at those who are decently silent.
Those “rights”, “independent”,“ immunities. ”
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of everything they fought with, he said.

Brother sentenced to life for killing honorary stars of the social media Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star due to pictures published on social networks, was strangled in July 2016.
The Brother of Pakistan's social media star Qandeel Baloch was recognized as guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to lifelong prison as the most loud in this patriarchal country “foreign killings, ”
Baloch, who gained fame, published bold selfie, was polite according to Western standards, but in a very mizoginal Pakistan considered provocative, was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the press conference that there was no regrets of conscience for his actions and declared that “of course, ” he murdered his sister and that her behaviour was“ unacceptable. ”
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that the court in the western town of Multan considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-term judgment.
“Inshallah (if God permits) will be removed by a court of higher instance,” he said.
Before that, the mother of Baloch, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she hoped her son would be removed.
“He is innocent.
It was my daughter, and this is my son,\" she said.
The murder of Baloch has come to the world’s information services and has resumed the call to act against the plague of honor killings in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking the patriarchal social rules.
Women were burned, strangled, shot or trained for such abuses as choosing their own husband or, in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family “institute, through the manifestation of their sexuality.
Kills are usually caused by a close relative.
According to Pakistan’s law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (even) can ask the closest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, Parliament adopted new legislation introducing a lifelong sentence for honor killings.
However, whether murder is considered a honorable crime remains in the hands of a judge, which means that murderers can theoretically rely on other motives and be removed.
In Baloch's case, her parents at first insisted that their son would in no way be favored.
However, the disgruntled think that they might also lose, change their mind, and declare that they want it out of the way.
The International Conciliation caused by the murder led the Pakistani State to take a unprecedented step and to give itself a heir along with their parents, thereby forceing the case forward.
One of Baloch's more well-known performances is to offer a stripper to be made in front of the Pakistani Kryte team and to introduce a trained purple dress in Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as a breaching restriction in the country in which suing for a figure like Kim Kardashian can be considered as a bold and political movement to strengthen women's position.
“honor’s roots, killings lie in tribal social standards, which continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular normalize women’s behaviour, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy undermines the number of displaced from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN organization stated that the increasing violence caused over the last four months to double the number of displaced persons from north-west Nigeria to about 40,000 people.
The UN Refugee Agency has stated that concerns have created a “new exceptional humanitarian situation” that requires an inter-agency effort to gather new measures of 35,5 million dollars by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group Boko Haram, which has been in the north of the country for decades, has not been responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of organised armed groups.

According to Polk, the 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders, as the authorities say, of the false name that he originally gave the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit his fault.
According to the police, he was killed by a 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguz, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son on July 16 at their home in Des Moines.

In 2010, he was sentenced to illegal entry into the United States.
\"The Sun: Boris Johnson, in the face of the rebellion of a cabinet wishing to reduce requests for rexity and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Only three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country surrounded by the Prime Minister are concerned that it is not enough time for him to get more important concessions.
Boris Johnson is faced with the risk of rebellion from the office wishing to reduce demands in relation to the rexite and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impasse on a new customs system that would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has identified proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as “unreal”
Ministers of the Korona expect EU decision-makers, who are head of Germany's Angel Merkel, to offer you, at the last minute, the criticised leader of the Tories compromise in the form of a three-year limit of time to implement the backup mechanism.
The newspaper “The Sun” spoke with three different ministers of the cabinet, all of whom prepare for confrontation with the Prime Minister after the annual tour conference next week in Manchester.
They will require the Prime Minister to reject the ‘aggressive strategy developed by his close advisor Dominika Cumingsa to try to apply blefu to the EU and to threaten to leave the Union without a contract and then to accept the offer made by the Union at the last moment.
One of the ministers of the cabinet identified the overwhelming verdict of the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday on the conclusion of the suspension of Parliament as “warning signal” and added: “The only way to leave us is by the European Union on 31 October is by doing it on the basis of the agreement.
We'll never beat the arrhythmias in the House of Gmin, which works for our failure.
The Prime Minister needs to bend now and accept what is capable of receiving.
Aggression does not pay: it is obvious that the Cummings plan burned on the pan.
We can't fight so many fronts.
The second minister of the cabinet committed himself to tell Johnson to try and push the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else was not done.
The Minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to resubstitute the agreement proposed by Theresa May in Izbie Gmin,
There is a number of opportunities for her vote, and everyone is very concerned about the end of this subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, Boris Johnson's end is over and we're all done.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking the negotiations seriously.
In a happy speech, the first minister in the Tory arm said: “Premier tells us that he wants a deal with the European Union.
But we don't see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he is in love with bulls in Scotland, checking the eggs in Wales and arguing with citizens on the main streets of the cities - all in front of the world, as if the election campaign had been for good -
Last night, the Ombudsman admitted that the agreement was still distant, adding: “No one should have illusions: a very long way to make an agreement;
However, the spokesperson also said that the Benna Act which put into effect the withdrawal of rexite by three months in the absence of an agreement “inactly weakens our negotiating position in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law is hindering us from the negotiations, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues continue to seek progress because of hard work.
The EESC's Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is coming back to Brussels today, where more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side will take place.
They will discuss the way the area works for Ireland for food and live.

Lorraine Kelly: It was said that I would never do my career on television with the glasg accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, television managers said that, because of the accent of Glasgow, “he will never do his career as a presenter.
In her 35 - year - old TV career Kelly, 59, she admitted that she had “a feeling very upset before her first show on the screen. ”
“ I was only 25 years old and very nervous, ” she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland as a search and information specialist, the chiefs said that through my accent with Glasgow I would never succeed on television.
I went to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the program issue before I took over my duties at the office in Glasgow.
I'll never forget an interview with a star of Bette Davis performed by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV correspondent in 1984, she started her career as a local reporter in East Kibride, Scotland.
Then she began to run such programs as “GMTV”, “ITV Breakfast, and “Daybreak”, to later send with her morning program “Lorraine” that took the name from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career is a special program, during which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The gifter said that her long TV internship is “passion and enthusiasm, ” and“ hardness,” adding: “It is hard to work.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare to prepare for programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When he mentions media reports that moved her emotions, Kelly says that “very difficult, ” it was for her to report the Dunblane bombing.
I had no idea that many families killed or wounded children were watching our live show from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of 16 children and their teachers.
One of Pam Ross's mothers, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting during which we talked at her house for many hours.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, where I've been taking part.
She added that “an unusually difficult interview with Kate and Gerry McCanny was shortly after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in 2007 and that“ he truly admires their strength and courage.
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and to bear the most awful comments of the internet trolli.
I'm with them all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30th at ITV Station.
Zimbabwe: Chiweng was afraid of imprisonment
A senior government officer claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiweng rejected the offer of taking over the President's office made by President Robert Mugabe at the peak point of the coup because he was afraid of imprisonment in order to confirm the military's taking over in November 2017.
Last week, “The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe, has offered Vice President Chiweng to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military in the course of the coup.
However, the senior government official announced in the social media that Chiweng did not reject the offer of fear, but because he saw Mugabe’s plan to use it to prove to global leaders and the African Union (UA) that he actually lost during the coup.
The Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to transfer to the Vice President of Chiweng, rather than President Emmanson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, which confirmed that he was a higher government official in the Bureau of President and Council of Ministers, was confirmed that there were intensive negotiations at that time.
The state officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiweng via one of his envoys when he realized that the authorities were getting out of his hands.
The media between the military authorities and the deceased former president had three stages in the view of the senior government officials.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was the spokesperson of President George Charamba, who then served as Head of the Central Organization of the Intelligence Aaron Nheper and a clergyman representing the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
Former Head of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was another element from the moment Mugabe sent him with a single mission to transfer the offer to the president of Chiweng, who was the Head of the Defence Force of Zimbabwe (SOZ).
After his death, a man who was even more regarded as an icon of Africa was in vain to obtain a condemnation from the AU by seeking to bring other African leaders into intervention.
The offer of the President, made by the deceased (Mugabe) of the former Chief of Defence Force (SSO) Chiweng, did not result from the choice.
“It was a desperate act to save the situation that took a dangerous pace, removing part of the dead family, he wrote to the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of a political piece through which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a way that was not diplomatic.
Just remind yourself that the commanders have testified that they have not rebutted, and will not put down constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the U.A.'s position on the coups.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiweng) would swallow the bait, rapidly stopping the claim of the leaders, that they did not put down the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, continued to be highly confused by the situation and the way in which it was put into its theoretical taxonomy of reverses, would then have no choice but to describe it as a reverse, and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
It is in such a spirit and with such a requisition that offer has been made.
The officers claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that defense forces had no longer been ready to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after he warned the mighty man that he was risking a rope in Kadaf's style.
The army chiefs told him they wouldn't return the rifle against the citizens if they moved on to Blue Roof's residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, namely to save his family and to prove that the army had taken over the power, adding to the official.
Early SSOs and commanders were properly reading assumptions.
The postman (Gono) was given the message to this destination to understand, through a powerful metaphor, that isu tiri veakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the stone section, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, claimed to be a higher national official.
State officials say that the army has notified military commanders in the area through the Attachs who have stayed in Zimbabwe that they are not intending to repel Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding “criminists.”
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try again Mnangagwa to return from short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about resurrect and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The inhabitants of South Africa, which is a key element of the process, not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was president of Sadc, refused intervention but clearly indicated that if the military hit Mugabe's house, as many times as it scared the background, South Africa's troops would immediately appear in Harare.
“ This did not work, because Putin and African leaders did not choose this route,” said the Independent, one informant.
China needs a strong leadership or “separate” as stated in the Policy Paper
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will “discount”, said the government in a policy document issued on Friday at the first anniversary of the creation of the People’s Republic.
The Chinese government press office sent a White Paper that the country’s successes since the Communists took over 70 years ago have been led by the party.
China has a large area, has complex national conditions, and there is rarely a problem of administration.
The document mentions that without China's uniform and strong leadership, China will move towards division and decay, which will be catastrophic for the world.
In solving problems, the Chinese authorities have long been applying a tough hand policy as in the event of a dampening of the pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain country stability.
President Xi Jinping, ruled by strong hand, who, on Tuesday, became the head of the 2nd anniversary celebrations of the world economy, has further strengthened the party’s governments and applied sanctions to those who might question the authorities at the end of 2012.
Xi also oversees the military modernisation programme that has cut off this region's balance.
The document stated that China did not try to export its development model or want to import any foreign models, but only to peace, rather than to “hegemonia.”
The Chinese don't have any other nature or domination in their genes.
In modern times, China was cremated by great powers, and wars and anxiety were depressed by their deep heels as a result of sufferings suffered; China will never cause the other sufferings they had suffered.
China is surrounded by this anniversary in uncertain times for a country caught in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never “exploit” their most important interests and will not allow any harm to their sovereignty.
With regard to the trade dispute of Washington, the document stated that ‘the danger of trade wars and the further increase in customs duties do not lead to problems’.
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide market location and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that “war trades will never weaken it,”
China is certain that they are able to face difficulties, to turn the crisis into new opportunities and to open a new world.
It has also been added that the United States should take a rational look at China's development, since China is not going to question the position of the United States or want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that China will stop its development.
The reduction and weakening of other countries and the transmission of national misunderstandings abroad will not ensure a strong position for the United States.
The world of Jack Pałkiewicz: Dubai, true face
Dubai’s people are still looking for their own identity, divided between Beduian tradition, religious radicalism in Islam and extremism of progressiveness.
This setting new trends in the world’s tourism leader has developed imagination and desire, breaking the vacuum of wealthy snobistic hotels and attracting the looking fortunes of investors and traders with the status of tax haven.
The website presents enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and concentrated architecture of the 21st century in one.
They were built on the rich in the oil of the sands of the Sun, and they became Eden for those who love the rest of the five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools situated hundreds of meters above the earth.
Many are thrilled by all-day, creative hyperactiveism and hysterical pursuits for vanguardism.
Here is the city whose motto says all: “Shoe, gloom, and charm, ”
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without character.
As the British writer Lawrence Osborne notes, “the full of extremes and contradictions of the metropolis has taken the dimension of the tandetrous grotesque, ” says the British writer Lawrence Osborne.
She turned into a futuristic nightmare, fully dominated by the “Knit of Guinness Records,” the Unofficial Constitution of Satan.
Because here everything has to be bigger and nicer than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something in the old Europe that is not transparent, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin and Madrid, everyone feels like they're at their house.
And certainly not in Dubai.
By running away from the world of magic, I broke his gold mask, revealing the second appearance of artificial paradise.
Count that doesn't talk about and doesn't write about.
I'm showing the hatred of Asians contrasting with the fairy-tale living conditions of the divine ethnicity of Dubai, the grandchildren of the immaginable Bedouins.
I'm starting to be in a place of extreme poverty, for example to gett on the outskirts of the city, where there are army of Asian workers in cruel conditions.
They were the ones who built in one generation in the slavery of the sky deserted Manhattan.
They came here with good wages and the opportunity to provide a decent life to their families, and there was a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it, because it could blow up the air that was created over the years of Dubai's myth.
More and more frequent criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labour very difficult for the emir.

“I was sick and it was probably a few years old.

I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the drawer.
The sketch was five years ahead of us.
The bike itself was built for three years, adding Adam Renovič.
“It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the caroseria.
There are batteries, wires, construction elements.

Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, the Circular Quay port, Luna Park entertainment park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge provides an important contribution to $21.9 billion, annually pumped in the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But there's an ugly truth under the bridge.
The famous Bay of Sydney is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country, to which every year the volume of pollutants is equal to the capacity of around 15 Olympic swimming pools.
These horrific statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our stupidest waterweeds.
According to the new film material entitled “The Bay of Sydney, on top and below, the water in the area of the most popular city of Australia are full of undercapacitants, plastic steaks and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and it all flows into the bay with rainforests.
However, the largest component of our shipping channels is plastic.
\"I would call it a paradox,\" says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of Sydney Harbour Research Program, in the published September 27, where the publication of this film gradually coincides with the World Tourism Day.
This Akwen looks beautiful, but he's one of the most modified and infected to cross the river along our coast.
The CSIRO estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic rises to our waterways, and its greater part affects the bay through storm canalization.
“After such a powerful flooding... it looks pretty tragic,” Dr. Dafforn said.
Two thirds of pollution comes from rainforests.
However, as in the case of the iceberg, the problem with Sydney's bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, since 70% of the plastic that rises to the ocean goes to the bottom of the sea.
“As far as it does not spend time underwater, you cannot really realize what is there in the depths,” said Richard Nicholas, the owner of the Diva Centre Manly, referring to the fact that he and his team themselves draw from water about 500 kg of plastic per year.
I think if more people knew (which is underwater), they'd just be terrified.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find at the bottom is plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe we're getting all this plastic and all the other garbage out of the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and Managing Director Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people, both local and tourists, could help reduce the amount of plastic and residues that rise to our waterways.
“This has to start at the source, ” he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better lead the recovery of materials and have more awareness of what we're starting in the oceans that eventually go into the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we'll be destroyed because 50% of our oxygen is from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our sources of food.
However, we can adjust this bay and restore it to the former glory, and it's very simple.
If we die of our oceans, we kill ourselves too.
The film material, financed by the TOMRA recycling company, in its broader efforts to promote education by Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages that often reach the environment, coincide with a study on the relationship between plastic and mental health that has been published this month.
The new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 established that 82% of respondents felt helpless to plastic waste and 25% of adult wines for waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The investigation revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern for parents, and 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns about the amount of plastic waste that would rise to oceans.
Many people who took part in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental anxiety.
Poland - Slovenia.
Memes after the grid game in the semifinals of ME
It wasn't an easy game.
The Slovenians had an elemental audience on their side, which successfully deconcentrated Polish retinas.
There were also a lot of controversial judges who did not count on four economies in one of the shares.
It happened at the key moment of the first set, when the Vitala Heynen described it as a chance to take off the rivals and win the first game.
However, this is not the case, and the Poles ultimately had to recognize the increase in the rivalry, which after winning 3:1 will play in the final tournament.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP Partner
The operator of the National Cloud, PKO BP and PFR has set up a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the operator of the National Cloud, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region - i.e. the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the design of the establishment of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by the PKO Bank of Poland and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of this company.
The partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we set in less than a year ago by proclaiming the establishment of an operator of the National Cloud.
The objective remains unchanged - digitisation of the Polish economy and the consolidation of its growth.
“Now Polish companies gain additional, sophisticated tools to implement it.
By using them, they increase their chances of promotion to world leagues, what we care about all of them.
The fact that Google joins them today significantly strengthens our joint project, says Zbigniew Jagiello, President of PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
\"The investment in the National Cloud Operator is perfectly included in the PFR strategy as an important element of country digitisation.
It will provide modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture to entrepreneurs.
\"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists to it,\" adds Paweł Boris, PFR president.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing calculation power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland in the service portfolio will find all the key products Google Cloud Platform such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The integration of Google Cloud services into the National Cloud offers will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that use their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, we will remain in Poland's jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators, namely Michael Potoček, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as IoT, which often increase demand for calculation power necessary for processing huge data sets.
VI General Office of Senior Parada

Diablems can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Diablems can have the key to treating cancer - researchers have a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask certain cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in devils and humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatments for oncological patients
What do the devils and people have to do with it?
Cancer cells that might become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the therapy of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to treating fatal tumors within the face, threatening the future of the devil's threat.
The study determined how to mask certain cancer cells in both humans and tors, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which turns off the marker, which would otherwise signal the immune system to the cancer attack.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomy and the type of skin cancer called Merkl’s cell cancer.
“The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immunological therapy, we can be able to reverse this process,” said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be directed to reintroduce markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
“This has far-reaching implications for those with lung cancer,” said Professor Dawson.
“This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we can treat her a lot better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will be used to treat the face of the devil's face, where cancer cells in a similar way avoid detection.
“It is unusual that the exact same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and in the Diablems)” said Professor Dawson.
“It has been very difficult to treat diablems so far.
But if human medicines can also be used in the Diablems, it is possible that this will help control the disease.
Scientists are amazed at the fact that around a really small star, there is a very large planet.
Scientists express surprise after the discovery of the solar system of 30 light years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planet formation, because in the layout of this large planet similar to Jupiter, there is a circle around a small star called red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of the gas planet of the giant GJ 3512b circling the central star of the red dwarf, published on 26 September 2019.
Most of the stars are much bigger than even the biggest planet around them.
However, as scientists stated on Thursday, in this case the star and planet slightly differ in size.
The size of the star called GJ 3512 represents about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet around it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.
“Yes, this is an absolute surprise,” said Mr Carlos Morales of the Catholic Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, who was the head of research published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar systems suggest that stars with low weight usually become stem stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
“In this case, we discovered a planet of a gas type, similar to Jupiter, around a very small star,” Morales added.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using the Calar Alto telescope in Spain.
It covers its star after a very elliptical orbit, and full lap takes 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emissions less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (stopni) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
“That’s why they have red color,” Morales said.
“There is evidence of the existence of a second planet currently around this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter,” Morales said.
Planets come from the same interstellar gas and dust drive that gives the star around which planets are circling.
According to the leading model of the formation of the planet called acretion, the object is originally created from particulate matter in the disk, and the planet's gravity force at an early stage of development allows the atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravity volatility model.
“In such a case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than we expect and may be cold,” Morales said.
This leads to the stability of the disk, and so there may be some denser areas.
These masses may grow until they fall and create a planet.
A delicacies worker accused of providing a bean diforestate co-worker containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion's county stopped Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, with bean diforests containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, from Albania, a 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Herndez was accused of delivering methamphetamines and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person, both crimes are second-degree crimes.

Medina-Herendez is in Marion County, designated bail is $50,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that a woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, supplying methamphetamines, stealing, having methamphetamines and possession of unauthorised weapons.

What's KAS doing about the head of the NI?
The rental of real estate for the amount below the market price is reservations which arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme House of Control Marian Banas.
What the treasure does in this case we asked the Treasury Administration in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in the report for “Superwizjera”, TVN raised doubts about property claims by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banas.
She's been studying the Central Anticorruption Office for several months.
The audit is scheduled to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statement, Banša was supposed to rent a stonestone of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand PLN per year.
The report “Superwizier” revealed that the hotel was in a stone rented by him for hours.
The head of NIK later explained on state television, why he was taking just over 5,000 PLN a month for renting the property.
“The Vyborcza, referring to real estate valuation experts, has estimated that it should be 15 thousand gold per month.
“The amount was lower because of the simple reason: I made a preliminary contract and just because the tenant was supposed to buy this stoner, it caused me to agree that the remaining payments would be settled on the sale of the stone.
However, there were doubts that such proceedings did not constitute an infringement of the law.
Konrad Zawada, spokesperson of the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow, informed TVN24 that “the matter directly deals with the Ministry of Finance,
“All these questions, please refer to the Minister of Finance,” he added.
In such cases, the invasion explained that ‘the activities are carried out by the National Treasury Administration’,
The press spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, Paweł Jurek, admitted that the National Treasury has been monitoring many cases that might raise any objections.
‘The tax administration is acting in such a way that it has its own information and is based in a sense in those information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it makes decisions whether or not it explained any particular case to the IMF.
“But because we are all in force throughout the financial sector of the tax mystery, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company,” he stressed, asked about Marian Banasia.
The Minister for Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that “the tax offices do not provide such information to the public.”
“It is known that the entire treasure equipment is dealing with very many similar cases throughout the country, ” he said.
Secretaries of the Royal Family: Surprised guests often fly by a royal plane
As part of the duties of members of the royal family during their lives, hundreds of travel around the world must be made available.
This usually makes it easy for the royal aircraft to drive the royal family around the world in important events and events.
It's not surprising that having your own plane is a privilege.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for recovery, there are no limits on the number of luggage, and, as it turns out, they may invite any guests aboard, including really unexpected ones.
According to the recently premiere on Channel 5 documentary film, not only the queen and prince Philip often travel by a royal plane.
During the program entitled “The Royal Air Force”, the former commander of the Queen’s flight revealed that, along with the royal family, they often flew furry guests.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes along with our very important royal guests could fly a very important royal dog.
It is not surprising that the queen could enjoy her beloved favorites accompanying her journeys as she is known from her deep attachment to the dogs of Corgi.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a fan of these four creatures, and they hear that she has been the owner of more than 30 Corgies since the coronation.
It is said that in 2007, she had five roots: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willowa and Holly.
They included five cocker sleeping: Bista, Oxo, Flash, Spike and Span, as well as four dogs that are cross-sectioned with corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
I'm sure the crew of the royal plane had their hands full of work.
An employee of the royal home of the walking dogs and asking them to meet their needs before taking them aboard the plane, says Shields.
It's a pleasure to tell you that there's never been any incident.
The programme also revealed a shocking number of luggage which the queen takes with him on board during his journey in the course of his duties.
“ In 1953, the queen, in her journey of 70 000 miles [700,000 km], took the luggage weighing 12 tons.
To be able to see it better, it's about as much as two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only person who has a weakness for fashion.
It is said that Princess Cambridge also has its own delight in transporting her wardrobe, and it is said that a separate sitting is on each of her dresses.
The new law enters into force.
Damaged in accidents will receive pensions
On Friday, the regulation provides for further payment of the pension to be seriously damaged, informs the Financial Officer.
This is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the specific powers of persons injured in the event of an exhaustion of the guarantee sum established under the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
It applies to persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time, they were much lower than the guarantee sums at present, so in some cases the insurers have already stopped paying the pension.
\"I have enjoyed this regulation because our institution has been seeking to create a mechanism for many years to ensure the serious damage caused by cases of financial support guaranteed from OC communication insurance or OC farmer despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum,\" says Alexander Daszewski, Legal Council at the Office of the Financeer.
According to the Financial Secretary, this was necessary, because it is often a very tragic situation for people in very bad health, which, for example, cannot work, but at the same time bear significant costs of post-treatment.
Some of them no longer had a compensatory pension and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sum in the OC.
The parts threatened it in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the insurer’s liability limits were significantly lower than the current ones.
Therefore, the problem of cutting down the guarantee sum in previous years was the most affected people who suffered injury in the 1990s.
At the same time, the guarantee sum was very low, and economic conditions resulted in an increase in prices.
“We also noted that this problem has also been affected by a number of mostly young people who suffered damage during the period when the sum of the sum was EUR 350 000 for each injured in the accident.
Today it is EUR 5,21 million for the event, regardless of the number of victims.
This is therefore a huge difference in relation to earlier times, so the problem required legislative intervention, like Alexander Daszewski.
It explains that since the guarantee sum is increased at some time, the legislator accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee sum in force at the time when it refers to the Fund of the claim for payment of the pension.
This principle applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the pension on the basis of a court order setting out a different amount of guarantee than set out in the OC insurance contract.
This is the case in the event of an increase in the guarantee sum by judicial means pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing contractual relationship.
\"In recent days we have sent letters to those who have asked us to intervene.
We provide information about new powers and, of course, we provide for the possibility of further support in the event of any problems, says Alexander Daszewski.

I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pull up my pants and grab my cell phone to call the ambulance, testifyed to the damage.
\"I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed me for her shirt and my hair, without letting me go, he added.
Even though Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her disclosure of sex, she didn't try to escape from responsibility.

Former Congressman of the State of Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, the retired Congressman of the State of Alabama died of the Republican Party Jack Edwards, who served for 10 years and belonged to the first wave of the Republican with the so-called Deep South.
The family spoke that Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting cancer with the pancreatics.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans of the state of Alabama on the Deep South because the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 minutes in Congress.
According to the statement given by the family in response to the recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return kindness.
“I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where joint debates and efforts to resolve the problems of the country will return politely,” Edwards said, by family statement.
The Governor of the state of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his form and his country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that, in his honor, the flag on the Alabama State Chapter would be abandoned into half the mat.
“He was the character of a true state servant and was the best man for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most important politicians,\" said Ivey in his statement.
Michelle Obama called Meghan Markle “Inspiration” on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed a high appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Princess Sussex “a little leader who breaks the schematics and makes our world a better place.”
The Princess and Prince Harry, currently taking a ten - day royal trip to South Africa with their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with young people at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of Obama Foundation.
“I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, “a brilliant leader who breaks the schemes and thanks to which our world becomes better,” the first lady wrote in her enthusiasm.
“Does this meeting with the leaders of Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation, or helping girls around the world to access the education they deserve is an inspiration for many people,” Obama added, setting up a picture that presents the smiling Meghan who poses with the leaders of the foundation.
Meghan had an interview with Obama for the September edition of British Vogue, a guest of the former singer of “Suits” series.
In a honest conversation, the first lady was talking about motherhood and how it changed her.
“The mother means bringing him to the art of forgiveness,” said Obama.
“Motherhood has taught me that most of my time it is my job to give space to children so that they can know the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in the heart.
Obama, who, from experience, knows what the pressure of being on a candlelight, shared with the princess advice during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
“The situation that you feel, imposed by yourself and by others, may sometimes burden you,” she said.
“My advice is therefore to slow down and not rush into anything.
I spent a few months in the White House worrying about my daughter, making sure they're good at school and have new relationships before I've devoted myself to more ambitious work.
I think that's needed, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains permission to sell alcohol despite complaints against the owner's identity
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Commission for the control of alcoholic beverages in Washington has submitted a request to check whether the local building of Trump International Hotel should lose the licence to sell alcohol because of the owner's identity.
The Agency held on Wednesday that three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis were unfounded because most of them do not live in the distribution or have no real estate.
“The Washington Post,” states that the second time these reasons are once again seeking to withdraw the hotel’s licence to sell alcohol, referring to the provision in force in the distribution, saying that the applicant for a licence to sell alcohol must refer to the “goodness of the person. ”
In the original complaint of the summer last year, President Donald Trump stated that he was breaking the law, and the prosecution of assault and repeated cases of fraud.
The complaint was withdrawn because the licence was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was to extend the licence.

We have the skatepark visualisation!
Are the youngsters finally waiting?
Older residents are intimidating young people driving on hurricanes and deskorols, and in turn they are complaining that there is no place for them in Oława.
Young people for years have been asked to take a seat for rollers, deskorols, hulainogs, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our fights.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time again, it's made it loud again about the lack of skatepark.
That's why we're back to this again and we're asking what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago, a woman who's been in trouble with young people is driving downtown.

“The people of the block have called many times to the City Guard ineffective.
As proof of such daily situations in connection, I send photos -
We asked others about this.
Most say clearly that young people simply have nowhere to drive in the city and for years they have ineffective demand for themselves.
At the post on Facebook, there was also a bottle of comments.
We have already written in July that there is a chance that the skatepark will be built in Oławska Miasteczek.
The mayor informed that the city had requested funding to build a skatepark.
‘The young project together with the permits is being consulted.

Polish Cup 2019/20: drawing 1/16 final.
We know steam, hit from years ago
It was one of the toughest competitions in the extravagant.
The biggest legend in the '1996/1997 period has been turned on by a memorial match.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took the old stadium at the Łazienkowski boating team in the previous line.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts must have won, the second of the Polish Championships gave a point.
Until the 87th minute Legia led 2:0, but for five more minutes there was an earthquake - the sight shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The ice club over the years fell into growing trouble until he stopped counting on the fight for championships and fell from the highest game class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in 2013/2014.
Legia, on her way to the title, had two wins: 5:1 at her place and 1:0 on her way out.

The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump asked the President of Ukraine Wołodymyr Zełenski to investigate the former Vice President Joe Biden, the candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zełenski to cooperate with Barre and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as a result of the protocol.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN claimed that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice notified a complaint by the Ombudsman concerning Trumpa proceedings involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
After receiving a complaint as a notification from officials from the Community Intelligence, the Department of Justice stated that Trumpa did not provide criminal investigation on campaign financing.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call a witness.
However, she added that Barr “was rebelled. ”
It's been a long time.
“Barra,” added Pelosi, referring to Trumpa’s prosecutor’s letter of office during the July talks with the Ukrainian leader.
Interestingly, he made decisions on how to handle the complaint.
Pelosi said that “very afraid of the signals that Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that he had been otherwise involved with spies in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond their responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signals have an important role to play in discovering the offenses in our government - stated Pelosi, adding: “The President’s words regarding people who can provide information seriously undermine the integrity of the government.
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step in declaring a formal investigation on the law making an act unlawfully based on allegations of the attempt to pressure the leader of a foreign country in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone call call was included in a complaint published on Thursday, where the signal claimed that Trump was using his power to \"incite Ukraine to intervene during the upcoming elections of 2020.
The signist also accused that the lawyers of the White House have told officials to remove the records of calls from the computer system in which they are kept for the purposes of officials of the Council of Ministers and put it in a system designed for sensitive information.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned by the structure of the verification committee
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of the Sekondi Hasacas Club, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the purpose of the upcoming elections to the National Association of Football in Ghana (GFA).
He contested the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, by adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu expressed doubts whether the President of the Commission would be fair because the outcome of the verification process is in its interest.
The verification committee should consist of neutral outsiders who do not have links with any of the members and who have not shown their business before.
For example, Davies employed NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for payment of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take his position in the Verification Commission, as he has an interest in it, he has claimed.
Manu declared that if, before the Commission, Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, there would be a conflict of interest by the President because of his association with the club, while suggesting that, if the State of Palmer is to be subject to prejudice and partiality before the Commission.
In line with the expectations of the Commission's members, they were expected to start work from yesterday, after their oath during the GFA Secretariat ceremony in Akra on Tuesday 19 September, and end them on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and her members are consultants for corporate governance and lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Larya, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sport administrator and lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
The two main parts of Israel, the Blue-Bials Alliance and Likud, continued on Friday negotiations on the establishment of a government of unity.
The meeting, which took place after the President of the mission of formalising the Government of Benjamin Netanjah, did not bring results.
The talks considered the possibility of the rotating chair of both parties in the government and the remaining Netanyjah as prime minister, but, as the Israeli daily “Haarec” says, there was no closeness of views.
The conversations will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Blue-Bials informed in the Communication that he presented the preliminary proposals.
Likud’s right-wing prosecution of “goes around in his positions, demanding that his leader and former prime minister, Netanjah, remain the head of the government, and in the composition of the cabinet, which is already part of the ultraortoxic politics.
“ From the very beginning, it has been a vision that the Blue-Biali will not agree on these conditions, the voices published by them.
For, by working solely in the interest of Netanyjah, he wants to “take Israel to a second round of elections, ”
The leader of the Blue-Bialy Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanjah would have led until he has been accused of participating in three corruption cases, on the basis of which the D.A. could formally accuse him after a meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
“Likud and Blue-Biaali have obtained a sufficient majority in elections on 17 September, which would allow them to be common governments as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate, which none of the parties wanted, writes the EFE agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin has tried to bring their positions closer in recent days and proposed that the “rottation order” be called, suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his duties, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the accusations against Netanyjah were maintained and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who think that things have been stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, according to a survey published on Friday by the public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing a government of unity under the rotating leadership of the change of Netanjah and Gantza.
50.6% of the Israelis, 32.1% of the surveyed, are in favour of this solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israel’s society, a question that should be the first to stand at the head of the cabinet, 41.8% of the respondents speak for Netanjah and 40% for Gantz.
In another survey published by the “Israel Hakom” newspaper, the percentage of government supporters increases to 63%, 60% are opposed to the new elections that would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on September 17, the Gantza Alliance won 33th mandates in the 120th district of Knest, the Neutany Likud won 32 mandates.
Netanjahu and its traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz, on 54.
None of the parties gathered 61 mandates necessary to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for the fight against the final game with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that “this is the time to check out, when the Valia is facing the final game with Australia within the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
Wales’s victory over “cangurami” would set this team up on a position for the winning Group D and guarantee itself participation in a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats the 14th event during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be quickly sent to the starting point with England as part of the eighth final.
“Let us make the case clear, both teams want to try to go through this and find themselves at the head of the group,” said the Welsh Rector Tipuric.
In the past, there have been some difficult results, but last autumn was nice to win with them.
I think they're gonna try hard to take this victory away from us, and we want to bring it back.
Before we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big start.
And now we're here, and this is really the time to check out.
Valia took only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup - and it took place 32 years ago in a game of 3rd place when they defeated “kangury”
And their overall record under the lead of Chief Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victorys in 41 attempts to defeat three heavy squads from southern hemisphere.
Walia followed the three hundred lost test matches from Australia's hands in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few saved from this winning 9-6, who would go to Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether or not the team experienced mental block before winning this, he added: “It is hard to say.
These games are so evenly balanced that maybe... people expect to appear certain mental locks, I don't know.
After the end of the last match, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final result looks a lot smaller than it actually was.
If Walia triumphs, then the fight against the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the mill Michael Hooper and David Pococek will be of crucial importance during detention and defeat.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in representation colours and met both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he's waiting for.
“He is a professional in the seventh world class,” he said.
When you play against the world's class, the third line of mills, you always know that the game will be difficult to play.
These two are always with the best players in the world.
You know what games you might expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is the more attacking seven and probably better feel rugby because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and face challenges than to face the third line of mill that's not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and fighting with the two of them, I'm sure you'll have to be in the peak form.
I wouldn't say Sunday's gonna be almost there, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
Impet is an important element.
When we build strength and keep making big efforts, we'll be going like we're on our wings and it'll be hard to beat us.

The Prime Minister of the Book.
-Waffen-SS - Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Millarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organisation of the “gross of the Lords”
They accepted in their ranks the ones they despised.
Could crime be more powerful than national identity?
In your hands, we don't give another book about war or military subjects.
We're giving a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
The historians from different European countries examine the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at the recruitment processes at the different stages of the war.
Did Danish troops differ from French?
Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn't it be possible to create a unit from the Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative on collaboration between European countries today?
What happened to volunteers after the war?
Among other things, the book “Waffen-SS” is based on solid research material.
We sought to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer truth of the picture of the collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, trying to break the methodological boundaries of histographies and the history period by presenting a report by researchers' authors from different countries. (...) As far as the fates of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavic population are sometimes presented in comparative and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are studied in principle from the national perspective (as it is done).
“A total panic, when the White House is struggling to find arguments on the impeachment
The officials of the White House will get wet, and they will think of how to resist the pressures that have been resumed on Thursday, and one of those who are familiar with the situation describes the sense of “total panic, felt last week due to the lack of a response plan for new reality.
It seems that this calls for “a concern, uncertainty and concern,” one of the people involved in the White House describes in this way the mood in the western wing - that allegations of the informant may seriously harm the President and the people of his environment.
She said: “There is no real certainty that nothing is hiding there. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain how to act, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because allegations are so serious that the standard methods for effectively avoiding controversial practices used by the president may not work in the past. “It does not look like something that will change with the next cycle of the headlines,” the person claimed.
Another person who knew the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as “the state of shock, accompanied by increased distrust, that with the ongoing investigation of the impeachment, the likelihood that the president would respond in an irresponsible manner and become“ difficult to master.
This fear is divided by another spokesperson claiming that the President’s people in the area will show that they will show more “primarily - conduct, and the pressure on it will certainly begin to increase on every day of the Impeachment investigation.
This raises concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behavior and, in an unexpected way, to blow up, this is in the context of the electoral year, a concern both from the perspective of the presidency and the elections.
Taking up the greatest threat to the president so far, Trump was circling from the attack to defense again following the strategy that he appreciated as effective during the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He tried to examine his own request to the Ukrainian president for assistance in the investigation of his political rivalry in order to distract and address it on the actions of Democrats and candidate for the Democrats of Joe Biden and to discredit the informant as a leading partisan motive.
But while a lot of people in the White House are being set up to fight after Mueller's investigation, this time something has changed - they found advisers and consultants.
The president, whose sign is strong, showed the Wednesday press conference as a defeated, said one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump was enthusiastic about the Russian investigation, he seemed not willing to answer the Ukrainian questions, they said.
Some of the President's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them stick to the fact that the informant had no knowledge from the first hand about this controversial phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President of the Zełensky Wołodymyr, which, according to them, undermines his credibility.
And as it often happens when the president is the object of the attacks, this fact is live raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican tragedies related to the White House indicates that the results of the surveying of support for the president are ungodly high, and the impeachment will not cause much more to gain new sympathy.
\"There is no positive need to concentrate on the President's impeachment in the next four months, especially if it makes it difficult for his legislative programme and predominant in the new cycle of the headlines of the news.
Another caller claims that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president were not fully understood how unpredictable he would react.
The responsible officials of the White House were looking for help with the advisers, setting up a team of responses to the empire.
According to a person with knowledge of plans, given that these efforts are in an early phase, it is unclear whether any command centre initiative will be taken and any form it can take.
This person stated that there is a belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a determined leader who is able to carry out an attack on the PR which is a rival on the publication of a clear signal report and to halt the expansion of the democratic actions of the impeachment given by the disclosure of this report.
The speaker, familiar with the situation, maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Treasury Steve Munchin declared that they had no intention to disclose the memo describing Trumpa's conversation with the Ukrainian President, and then 48 hours later it was possible to sense that there was no exit and to publish the document.
It is now expected that the pressure will now be greater than in the course of the investigation by Robert Mueller, who usually kept silence, and spoke only through accusations. One person who could be involved in the development of the response to the empire is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work Trumpa and former head of election staff, said the person involved in the case.
But Lewandowski said in his conversation with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that it will direct this action.
\"For the last five years, I have done everything I could to support the President and his program,\" he said, \"but I have not participated in any conversation with the President or his team about joining the team in order to separate the false narrative of the impeachment,
Donald Trump's private attorney from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in the impeachment activities.
“We are responding to how we should,” Sekulow replied when he was asked by the NBC News for comment.
Now the White House has felt the lack of lawyer in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flower, who worked at the Clinton empire and advised the White House at the end of the investigation of Mueller, left and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, does not have this kind of experience.
The speaker, familiar with the White House strategy, stated that general officials had no intention of involving people or creating a command center at any time, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, joint response and a person who could lead a political struggle.
The Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean passed the repair for £89 million

Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats that they demand “the naked photos of Trumpa”
Congressman Devin Nunes of California can't possibly bear naked truth about the fact that the investigation of President Donald Trump's case is ongoing.
In his Thursday defense, the president accused Democrats of getting naked photos of the president.
Nunes, the high-ranking Republican in the Commission's interview with the House of Representatives, put this plea in the course of the preliminary statement during the hearing as a result of the hearing, as if Trump asked Ukraine to open an investigation against the candidate of the Democrats for President Joe Biden and his son.
Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal “grotesque presentation of the Left and their “Medical Ace” before he said that the Democrats wanted to see the photos of the President in the neglige.
“The Democrats in this committee were negotiating with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians to receive naked pictures of Trumpa”, said Nunes.
“The people can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to charge the President with accusations when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes ended up giving reprimands, a political reporter on the HuffPost website, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really try to find out.
Until now, he only responded to the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, although we suspect that his answer is the naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com portal suspected that Nunes’ comments about the suddenness of “a sureer, more and more uncontested information, likely to appear in the controversial Steele files,
It is celebrated, gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele, a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of a tape that shows him that he is a prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research into renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to have been to be decommissioning renewable energy - aircraft.
However, the professor at Albert University developed a technology that will enable renewable biofuels to be used as an aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University in Agriculture, Life Science and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory produces hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fatty waste, such as restaurant fat, animal origin fat and rape oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils in production, estimated to reach 85% of lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels and also use waste from other industries.
This technology is intended to include hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
“What our technology has done in the first generation,” Bressler said, “that’s what the hydrocarbons that are the same as diesel fuel particles.
While it opens up the new possibility of using biofuels, pre-developed biofuel products had a tendency to destabilise at lower temperatures, which, in the case of large-scale aircraft, was a serious threat.
‘The air fuel problem is a bit wrong,’ said Brassler.
It's actually worth less than diesel, but it has higher demands.
Blessler's laboratory is currently looking at two options to produce air biofuels.
The first option is a low risk approach, which requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties, which will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
“We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit,” Bresler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company created by Alberta University, Forge Hydrocarbons, works on product co-commercialisation, as airlines as well as Canadian and American army increase investment in renewables.
“They are able to imagine the times in which they can reverse the situation and will be imposed on them by a carbon tax,” he said.
Instead, they want an alternative to be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received $4 million from Lockheed Martin in an investment aimed at supporting the 25 million production plant construction that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the expected reduction in coal will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will continue to reduce coal further.
“As a technology specialist,” said Brassler,
I have the task of developing options that make informed decisions and many choices to choose from,

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that, in the event of the withdrawal of the UK's brittle threats such as Los Angeles, he calls for peace
One of the chief ministers of the cabinet said yesterday evening that the national threat of “a violent social crisis, if the original result is questioned by the result of the second referendum.
The allies of the UK Prime Minister from his nearest environment warned that national social unrests at the scale of protests on the “yield vests” - in France due to social inequalities and settlements in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for “the peace of the mood, during a turbulent argument about the language of politics, but stressed that it did not stop using the word“ giving up, ”
Despite his call for peace, the minister said: “The Times: “In this country, there have never been protests such as the demonstrations of “Gilets jaunes“ (\"Jewish vests - or settlements in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because it hasn't happened before.
Now they have an example - the gilets jaunes - are using encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate the picnics, and it is enough to push people to protest to some of the uninhabitable populist leaders.
L.A.'s properties broke out after the jury took out four white policemen who beat Rodney King's black cab driver in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France carrying yellow reflective vests, a gilet jaunes - for more than six weeks empty and devasive of Paris' streets.
The Minister referred to Johnson's warning in the House of Gmin and said that if Great Britain fails to leave the EU, there will be a “cataster loss of trust in our political system”
\"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people are voted and 66% of them will speak for the remaining UK in the European Union, the unsatisfied will remain ten million citizens,\" said the Minister.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not forgive.
There's not much we need to see on the street for a few hundred thousand people soon.
One of the main ministers of the cabinet added that the country threatened “a violent social crisis, if the result of the first referendum is questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
Johnson called for universal elections to be organised, in which voters should decide the fate of the brittle.
According to the statement, the Prime Minister is faced with the risk of the rebellion of a cabinet wishing to reduce requests for rexite and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
Holows, Chechnya and Krosny were caught in Krakow.
Behind us Talk'N-Roll
More than 300 participants were heard on Thursday (September 26) 11 inspiring speeches of speakers among whom include Simon Holovnia, Krystyna Cubyn and Ireneusz Krosna were among others.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which was held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expanding horizons, talking about the ideas of worth hearing and joint discussions that can become an impulse for further development.
Such a goal was put forward by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, including those known from the media - Simon Holovnia, Klubyn and Ireneusz Krosny.
This year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was called \"Crafting the future, NEW\" and the appearance of guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session opened the Managing Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Trees, who announced how the brand that is building around can have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went up to the stage to change the perception of the audience on the issue of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if he wanted to create a future, Chris Badura took the subject of empathy in the time of rapid development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional life and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-war conversation with Krystina Chubyn, which spoke, among other things, about how, from the perspective of the conference over the years, the profession of a tutor changed in Poland.
The holder of one of the most popular votes in the country admitted that, thanks to the development of technology, everyone can be in trouble with this profession today.
However, in the coming years, he does not think that a person in the position of a tutor will be completely replaced by technology.
In fact, Peter Nabielec took the problem of living in the time of information, emotional or overloading about the choice, giving the audience valuable guidance on how to deal with him, and Łukasz Łętoch in his speech talked about what he could lead to another industrial revolution, known as “The idea of 4.0”
Enjoying learning to play
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist, Daniel Oneak.
In turn, the third part of the conference opened Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the Pantonim audience, and then, for example, he told about how he tried to maintain the right balance between his career on the stage and private life.
He also kidnapped Simon Holovnia in his speech, stressing, first of all, the role of time in our lives.
The publicist noted that even two minutes could dially change the situation and we need to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared his thinking about the surrounding reality by calling on this anecdotes that could create a smile on the faces of the viewers.
Then Adrian Twuszka appeared on the stage, which reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Słowiak, for example, Rubik's ankle, spoke about the approach to solving the problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly raised something new in the perception of the reality of all who had the opportunity to watch performances, and the natural reactions and many questions to the guests testify to the great involvement of the audience.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all who could not personally participate in the event, and the recordings from the subscription are available on the website.
Governments rather than rule of law.
\"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the governing majority introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating a threat to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the three-dimensional division, writes in a report published on Thursday by the Helsinki Human Rights Foundation.
The report ‘Legal Rules instead of Law Rule’ describes, inter alia, changes in justice and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Human Rights Foundation (HFPC) published on Thursday the report entitled ‘Legal Rules instead of Law Rule.
Risks to protect human rights in Poland between 2015 and 2019
The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the greatest human rights protection regression in Poland was recorded after 1989.
\"Without the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the governing majority has made a number of changes in the state system, creating a threat to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the three-party division of power.
By adapting the right to political objectives, governments were replaced by law governments, which were written by the HFPC experts.
What about the HFPC report?
The report describes changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as public media or Ombudsman) and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, the rights of LGBT and the right to a fair process).
The report also summarises a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
\"In the last four years, for the first time and for such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to carry out the collective interests of the parties.
This was translated into a ongoing legal crisis, as well as the weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland, stressed Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are the ‘systemal period of changes both in the country and ‘with regard to the protection of human rights’.
Over the last four years, Sejm has adopted more than 20 legal acts key to human rights protection.
“The exchanges were often accepted at a speedy pace, without public consultation and despite the reservations of legal backgrounds, Ombudsman or international organisations,” explains Małgorzata Szuckek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed in the last four years are: “the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), non-consumption of binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of human rights protection guarantees;
The authorities of the State shall not fail.
In particular, the Helsinki Human Affairs Foundation considered “the situations in which the state authorities did not respond, or simply underestimate cases of aggression,
Foundation experts have noted that some changes have been introduced into the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of State activity in reducing the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities with the European Union and a number of recommendations from international law players.
\"The failure to implement these recommendations does not only weaken Poland as a leader of democratic change in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also undermines the Polish state's responsibility for the infringement of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights - we read in the report.
Brother of the Pakistani social media star with life for honor killings
Women's rights experts claim that justice investigation is often difficult due to the prolonged proceedings, the release of suspect killers for bail and the public awareness of matters.
“It takes so long for people to forget,” says Farzan Bari, the advocate of women’s rights and the founder of the first female in Pakistan, the gender department at the university, and adds that even the broad case of Baloch’s murder has been resolved for over three years.
Although, according to groups fighting for women's rights, fair data are difficult to determine, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 has identified at least 300 cases of so-called honorable murders.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of the crimes of honorary motives estimates that there are about one fifth of the 5,000 honorable murders committed every year in Pakistan.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, transfers to the country are small, because many migrants are outside Poland permanently, says the Friday “Rzeczpolita”:
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to more than PLN 8.6% in 2018, which means that they increased by almost a thousand gold, almost 12%.
Euro-Tax “estimates that the total revenue of Polish economic migrants in the Union has reached a record value of PLN 154,5 billion in 2018, with one seven more than one year earlier, we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are getting better and better on the international labour market, where they use different options available.
The number of professionals and professionals who, in search of increasingly improved conditions, are moving from the country to the country, as well as international corporations workers, is reported by the newspaper.
Part of Euro-Tax customers work in two countries throughout the year, such as the United Kingdom and Germany.
“This was the most in 2018, because by 11%, the total earnings of Polish emigrants increased (up to PLN 27 billion).
However, the most earning Polish people on the Islands - almost PLN 35 billion - we read further.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite improving working conditions in the Polish market, the number of labour migrants does not decrease.
In the West and north of Europe (with Norway) it is often an opportunity for several times higher wages than in Poland.
‘This even at minimum rates in the country in question, which, for example, is EUR 9.5-11.7 per hour in Germany, reports the logbook.
‘Security’ states that Poles remain not only because of higher wages, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles leave their roots abroad, which can also be seen after decreasing monetary transfers to the country.
These past year's been the lowest of years.
As the economist Tadeusz Christecki recalls, with the extension of the time spent abroad, a small group of people who transfer money to the country and decreases their height.
“Emigrations are bringing close ones to each other, ” says the “Rzeczpospolite” on Friday.
The prolonged monsoons cause flooding and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended by almost a month, and the unexpected rainfall caused death due to the decommissioning of buildings and gnomes of many yields.
In northern India monsun is usually resolved at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be at the latest ending monsun for decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unexpected - in the recent period in India, the town of Pune Wednesday and Thursday rains have led to the death of a dozen people and a desolation as a result of the collapse of buildings.
There was a flooding of houses, people were taking across the streets in the water on their knees, which normally occurs only during the monsoon apogeum.
Large rainfall occurred also in cities such as Kalkuta, Lucnow and Hajadabad.
As a result of long rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand many houses were destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
In many areas, there was a lack of water, so farmers were preparing for the likely drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
\"For him my vegetables,\" says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the effect of the delayed and the late ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, i.e. an insignificant component of Indian food.
Onion, which usually had to be paid for 20 rupees (0.23 UK pound), currently costs 80 rupees (approx. 1 UK pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and holidays are also at stake.
Another big festival is the occasion of the 8th October Dasara celebration, during which the Indians raise huge cups like comics, presenting Ravana, a character with a white moustache and a sweet smile with the epos of “Ramajana”
Ravany's smoking symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that the similarities of Ravana were made of paper, if the monsoon continues to continue, that is what Ravana will laugh at the last.

Doodle celebrates the 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine the world today without Google.
In the search engine we're looking for answers to all the questions we ask.
What are we looking for in Google?
“ What is this, “Where, “How, and “How many are one of the favourite categories of Poles.
The giant data show that last year we were happy to ask, among others, “Where there is a storm, “How to make a scorpion, and “How many fingers the horse has, ” “How to get rid of the flour of the fruit - how to eat cocoa. ”
Today's search engine celebrates the first 20th birthday.
Its users - and in Poland 96% are using “the Uncle Google” - welcome today a special Google Doodle.
He's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthdays, showing a fixed computer with a monitor, a mouse and keyboard, and in the bottom right corner a digital date was printed - as in the 90s picture.
Registration of information
The search was created for a specific purpose - it was intended to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from a mathematical term of goomol indicating the number of ten raised to the hundredth power.
This name was also intended to reflect the intention of a company to build up as many sites as possible from global Internet resources.
Google's search was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their study project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which acted better than the method of normal adjustment of the results based on the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning of the search, the search was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages connecting to the result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. September 7, 1998, and soon later launched the Google.com website.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, “PC Magazine” appears in information about the extremely high efficiency of Google search results.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, to hit the next markets and to increase the company's value.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL index has more than a billion items, which makes Page and Brina’s work to gain the world’s largest online search engine.
Currently, a company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players on the IT market.
Is there yet another field to develop?
“The mission of Google is to organise global information resources to be widely accessible and useful, although we have made great progress in this field, it is still a very long way ahead of us to achieve this goal - to ensure that we speak with “Newsweek”, Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that working with exposure to plant protection products at high concentrations may translate into a high risk of heart problems in later years of life.
This happened in the case of a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, which has been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more vulnerable to heart disease or stroke.
“It highlights the need for personal protection equipment to be used for the time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of reporting in medical documentation contact with such measures at work, as well as to monitor standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease,” said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez' co-author.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Mano's district.
Results were based on figures of more than 6000 men on the island of Oahu, who took part in the Cardiological Programme of Kuakini Honolulu.
As scientists noted, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations because it concerned only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long time of fishing breakdown, so their health effects may be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection products.
In the press release, Rodriguez said: “After 34 years of male observations, the link between the exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant.
This was probably because factors related to ageing were more important, which masked the possible causal relationship between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in later years of life.
Researchers have not discovered a significant relationship between exposure to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increase in the risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone call Zełewski-Trump: Poroshenko throws its three grand
Washington's policy has a turbulent week in the opening of an impeachment procedure against American President Donald Trump
Getting involved in political scandals is a political debut for Wołodymyr Zełenski's situation, which he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about Zełewski-Trump and will it have far-reaching effects for the first of them?
Almost at the beginning of the phone call, Trump declared Zełensek that the United States are doing more for Ukraine than the European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not full, they describe in detail Trumpa’s attack on the German Chancellor Angela Mercel for the fact that the German leader together with other European leaders are engaged in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
Controversy raised Zełenski's response, which said that he agreed with Trump not 100%, but in 1,000%.
Zełewski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are not sufficient to help Ukraine.
This exchange of sentences made politicians, especially from Ukrainian opposition, decide to take their voice through social networks.
Petro Poroshenko, former president of Ukraine, said on Twitter that EU support “was without precedent”
In other tweets, Porosenko said that he was grateful for the “Russian aggression” that involved sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including the Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now?”
Then Trump mentioned military assistance and asked Zełenski to investigate not in one case, and two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and the other referring to breaking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the demonocratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it describes European relations or that relations with France and Germany will be resolved.
I don't want to talk wrong about anyone...
We thank all those who give us help,” said Zełewski, after publication, during the United Nations General Assembly of New York telephone calls.
Zelenski is expected to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of “the normalist four, which is expected to take place in October.
Former Civilian Inspector legally disqualified
The court cleansed George Wisniewski of his actions.
After six years, Jerzy Winiewski was finally cleared of charges.
The Court of First Instance cleared Jerzy Wiszewski, former Head of the Civilian Inspector of Quality of Trade Articles in Rzeszów, on the charge of exceeding the licence.
The Lublin Public Prosecutor accused him of betraying the former Marshals of the province of Poland of the term of inspection in the food oil plant.
He's been in the middle of this case recently under the law of annulling sentence.
The appeal was recognized on September 12th.
“The court has maintained the action under appeal,” confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, Advocate of the Court of First Instance in Industriality.
It's a judgment of 14 February handed down by the General Court in Industriality.
At that time, Jerzy Wiszewski commented on Facebook: “It was six years after the presentation by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Appeal in Lublin of the alleged breaking of the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of Podkarpackian War on 30 April 2012.
The court clearly stated that I was innocent and I did not break the law at that time.
I was convinced that my phone call then with the Marshal of Podkarpacki's War was in line with the applicable law.
The version of the events that the public media described in 2013 by the Appellation Prosecutor in Lublin was true and caused irreversible damage to both the food manufacturer and the loss of the image of my person with my employers, among employees, as well as in the local community.
The act of prosecution which was drawn up against me in the opinion of the Court of First Instance contained a number of mistakes, false facts, unrealistic terms of legal basis, not confirmed in the reality of events.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was released immediately from work and without funds.
I stayed for a long time in keeping my husband,
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wiszewski served as a lead inspector for the trade quality of agri-food products between 2009 and 2013.
It was dismissed after the prosecution in Lublin presented charges in 2013.
According to the investigators, he had in his phone talk betrayed the former Marshal of the Region (Mirosław Karapeta was sentenced to four years of imprisonment) the term of inspection at the establishment producing food oil belonging to the wife of the former Deputy Minister of Podkarpacka.
This is a warning, as prosecutors in Lublin claimed, meant that the company owner knew about control and corrected the label on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisewski heard allegations of overfishing, which threatened him up to three years of imprisonment.
\"I feel relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning I was convinced that I did not do anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the judgment of the right to accuse me of all the charges that were imposed,\" notes Jerzy Wiswiewski.
The White House tried to hide the recording of talks with Zelenski
On Thursday, a recent report by the author wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to President of Ukraine Wołodymyr Zełenski, sought interference from an alien state in the U.S. elections and the White House sought to hide the entry of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, a signaler who is probably an intelligence employee wrote: “In my duties, I was informed by many US government members that the president was using his function to demand interference from a foreign country in the election in 2020 in the United States.
“Trump used part of the conversation (from Zelenski) to pursue his own interests.
And precisely, he tried to push on the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the President in the reelection in 2020 - to voice the report quoted by the newspaper - The Hill -
The Ukrainian leader “was able to understand that the contacts with Trump depend on whether“ it will show the desire to play, in cases more specifically about which the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani was to inform him.
The author acknowledges that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail of its content by “a great number of White House officials who had direct information on this subject, and their relations were covered.
\"In the following days after this conversation, I learned from many American officials that the high ranked representatives of the White House intervened to \"deposit\" all the archive records concerning this conversation, and in particular the literal entry that was drawn up, as usual, in the White House crisis room, we read further.
\"High rank officials of the White House told me that the lawyers of the White House have told them to remove electronic records from the information system in which such records are stored.
The entry was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store sensitive information and manipulate them, wrote the author of the report.
“In my assessment, these steps show that the White House officials realized that they were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation, he evaluated the signaler.
As the AP comments, this document will probably speed up the procedure with regard to the possible impeachment of the President, and it also contains valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this report.
The recording of talks with the White House, following the pressures of Congress, made it available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of electronic records, but on the basis of the relationship of those who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in the edited version, revealed the day after that the Board of Intelligence of the House of Representatives.
Joseph Maguire also testified to the Board of Intelligence of the Chamber of Representatives on Thursday and explained how he treated the intelligence report.
Maguire said that the signaler made the right choice and did the right thing.
He also stressed that his view of the matter of talks with Zełenski was an event of “no precedent, ”
The Democrats in the interview committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release of a report to Congress; he denied that he had no authority to disclose its content, whose confidential character guarantees the so-called privilege of executive authority.
Part of the Maguire hearing was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, in view of the suspicion that the President had been putting pressure on Ukraine's authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives had launched an investigation that could lead to the Trumpa impeachment.
The day later she appreciated that the entry of Trumpa from Zełenski confirmed that the US president broke the standards on elections and security.
The U.S. election law prohibits the use of foreign state aid.
The Resort of Justice, however, appreciated that the president had not broken the electoral law. On Thursday, White House Stephanie Grisham said that there was no “no wrong one” in the talk, and in the report “there is nothing more than a set of relationships with the third hand and glass press cuts together.
“The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and false narrative promoted by the media’s main nurt,” she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO Prizes
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th Meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The security prize was granted in proof that Ghana was the highest in Africa with the highest number of safety oversight points, i.e. 89.89 percent of the temporary rate of effective implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Safety Audit Programme.
The security prize was evidence of a high country involvement in the implementation of ICAO standards and security protocols at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The award programme has been developed to support ICAO initiative called No Country Left Behind.
In addition, ICAO Member States, which improved their safety and security standards, were granted 16 other safety certificates and 17 in the field of protection.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director of the Civil Aviation Office of Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghana, Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiva Benard Ali, stressed the need to maintain safety in the air space by the Member States.
He said: “It is important that we continue to remind ourselves that even in the age of innovation in aviation security and sustainable development, we must remain our primary priorities.
Mr Adda pointed out that the awards were a huge achievement for the state's efforts, as they were a compliment to the hard work and sustainability of the industry.
He added that the aviation industry had a huge potential for developing the country’s economy, saying, “the aviation has a powerful potential to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but all results from the safety and protection that we have managed to achieve -

Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting as the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he testes at the Senate Budgetary Subcommittee on the FEMA budget proposal for the financial year 2020 in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
WASYNGTON (Reuters) - The White House announced that on Thursday, the American President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynora as Head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor as Deputy Administrator FEMA is the head of the agency who oversees government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency has been acting without the controller approved by the US Senate since March when Brock Long released this position.
Long resigned after the National Security Department of the United States, who is subject to FEMA, claimed that Long was in inappropriate use of government vehicles for crossings between Washington and its home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month, when the thorough examination of his past revealed allegations that he was involved in a fight in a bar.
Gaynor's nomination was expected.
In order to approve his nomination for this role, most of it will be required in the Senate.
The White House announced that before Gaynor was appointed as the representative of the FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the sea foot.
Henrik Ingebrirtsen, Norwegian runner, is considering the amputation of the finger
28-year-old runner specialized at a distance of 1500 metres, earning a gold medal of European Championships in 2012 (Hells), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the Vice-President of Europe at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a newilment and that he had already passed one operation immediately after the 2016 Games, but the pain returned and in the current season very intensely.
Pain makes me otherwise set foot, which in turn changes my system, there are other unnatural burdens, and I begin to feel pain in other places, for example in the climate.
For this reason, I could not prepare enough for world championships, and for two weeks the pain is so strong that I have difficulty wearing earrings - said the runner on the air channel NRK.
The father and coach of Gjert Ingebrirtsen admitted that after long discussions with their son, they concluded that the only way he would not end his career and participate in the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It looks like it's the only solution, although the drastic solution, and the decision has already come to an end.
“If part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and, in fact, Henrik does not need that finger so badly and in this situation, you should forget the cosmetic aspect,” he explained.
Police are closing an illegal e-poperos factory with marijuana in San Gabriel - CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) - On Thursday, the police closed the illegal e-papyros factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
At an office building standing on 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37 there was a raid, during which the police were searching for illegal e-papyros containing marijuana and during which large jars containing a butane fire oil were found, a concentrate from an Indian hemp.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the Police, El Monte officers also found a device that was used to supplement the calcium cartridges.
“This process is very dangerous,” says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially easy process.
“The usual electrostatic spark of our clothes can cause the ignition of these fumes, causing not only fire, but due to concentration, even the explosion,” he says.
“If there are many elephants in the room and similar ones, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could throw away from the surface of the entire complex.
The office has called for a task force to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At present, the value of the products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous clue that allowed them to get a search warrant, so they detected illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to get information on who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person started a business here because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to ensure that illegal products have not been found on the street, taking into account recent articles on the harmfulness of calcium.
“ People don’t really know what products they buy,” says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our community and children, so we always follow them before reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF has made a decision on the powder
The main pharmaceutical inspector informed us that the medicine was withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used for the treatment of cane and yeast infections of the mouth membranes, Gram-positive infections.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to the non-compliance with the quality specification of the product smell and the decrease of the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
Each month GIF shall issue on average several decisions to withdraw a series of products from the market.
A series of suspensions in Poland can be reintroduced once evidence is provided for the safety of its use.
There is no possibility if you withdraw this medicine.
Banknot 19 zł - where to buy a collector's banknotes about this nominal?
He was wearing 19 gold Nominees, and he was seen by the image of Ignac Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collector's banknote will be introduced into circulation, informing the National Bank of Poland.
This is another banknotes from the series “Undependence”
It is intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Polish Securities Production.
As described in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the bank.
The date on the bank, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the creation of the PWP.
Also nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of creation of the Manufacturers - we read the NBP in the Communication.
The watermark presents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknotes produced in the PWPW after regaining independence.
The new feature is a holographic belt placed on a window in the ground.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription “undependent” was represented by the image of the Order of the White Eagle.
This inscription, drawn from the manuscript of Józef Piłsudski, is a logotype of stores of 100 years of independence recovered by Poland.
In the watershed branch, symbolising fraternity and victory, the security developed by the PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of an angle effect.
On the other hand, there is a image of the building building in the background of the panoramics of modern Warsaw.
Next, there is a PWPW logo-type protection of SPARK Live and an opalescent belt, visible also in the light of UV in the form of repeated numbers -19 - and short -NBP - described by NBP.
The banknote is to enter the circulation on October 2, October, with a total of 55,000 pieces.
One bill will cost 80 zlotys.
All coins and banknotes issued by the NBP, including those of the special series, are a legal payment measure in Poland.
Their nominal value, however, is much greater than the one that can be achieved on the collector's market.
The new owner bought it for $500, more than two million gold, for his parents, and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded to the bar.
From there, it passed a river of 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Gosiewska Małgorzata
President PiS Jarosław Kaczyński in the coming elections will vote for the Małgorzata Gosiewski.
“The same thing he appealed for.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Małgorzata Gosiewski invited them to the photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, the Warsaw “three” praised in the social media that it was Kaczyński’s vote in parliamentary elections.
“The President of Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewski,” says the Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, on Facebook.
The head of the party indicated that he was a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to carry help.
“I will give my voice back to Małgorzata Gosiewowska, and I would like to call for the same.
Gosiewska is running for Sejmu from district 19. (Warszawa) and third place on the list.
“The only place is Kaczyński himself, and the second place is Mariusz Kamiński.
The Christmas Fair of Books is coming.
Before us we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
“We are here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpacia say they don't read books.
We'll show it's different,\" she said during a press conference, Martha Semitourk.
And who will help the Rzeszów clean up this year?
As we heard, Sister Anastasia, the first cook of the Republic of Poland, and also: Luke Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bond, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Piewiak, will appear at the fair.
This autumn in Millenium Hall will be held a great cultural event - 22 and 23 November to the shopping centre will welcome the 3rd edition of Christmas Fair Books, which is one of the most important events of readers in the region.
The fair will host the most interesting publishing and bookstores from all over Poland.
There will be 30 of them, and among them there will be among them, among others, Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they will present their wide range of publishing and hundreds of book news that participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, there will be special meetings with writers during the two days of the fair.
This time were invited by authors who write about important matters and are not afraid to make difficult themes, and they are also laureates of prestigious awards and... they cook well.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At this moment, the exhibition was confirmed by Łukasz Orbitowski, the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wiszywski, the author of the bestseller, and the queen of Polish crime, Katarzyna Bond.
This year's exhibition will be the star of Sister Anastasia, author of several books (including cooks) that have sold over 4 million copies.
Exhibition of the missing dress Elizabeth I at the Hampton Court Palace
The silver thread of the dress, made of the most prominent silk stone, was consistently decorated with hafts representing vegetation, animals and butterfly.
For Eleri Lynn, the curators of the Royal Palace Foundation exhibition, it only meant one thing.
It has been visible for 100 years on the wall of the tiny rural parish church she has been looking at, it could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's dressing room.
Three years after Lynn was encountered by accident at an exhibit altar in the Bacton County of Herefordshire, Elizabeth's missing dress was supposed to be at the Hampton Court Palace next month, near the same premises where the queen of Tudors could wear it over 450 years ago.
The measure of this discovery is that only one element of the 16th-century dress survived from the entire collection of royal dresses.
Although there is no clear proof that Elizabeth will ever wear this dress, three years of research has strengthened experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal dressing.
“The silverworks, an incredibly expensive cloth, were legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtual quality of exposed plants and flowers, then enriched with deer, dogs, butterfly, fishermen and bears, indicates that the collection belonged to the most prominent of people.
The dress, at the time when it was sewn, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's estate.
“More than that in the 1990 ’ s, i.e. at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, it felt like a threat from other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals carrying such fabric,” said Lynn.
\"As a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the dress.
I was really glad to see the dress, too, and they were pretty happy that we had an element of the royal wardrobe ahead of us.
Long, relived dress, cut to serve as a altar fabric in St Faith's dark church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Lady of the court, who served the queen throughout her long life, and with which the fabric was identified in local legends.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to Parry or Blanche's parish before she died in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservative work, the four hundred were found on the most delicate hand neck with specially painted silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will be placed next to the exhibition by the Hatfield House portrait Palace “Rainbow Portrait”, one of the most famous modern images depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
“When working with historical fabrics, it is really beginning to respect the uniqueness of the people who have done it,” says Libby Thompson, the chief conservation work, the majority of which took place in the converted glasshouse of the Hampton Court Palace, the only large enough to accommodate some of the priceless palace gobelins.
“When I look at the haft from the front and behind, I began to feel a lot of respect for those who did it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition “The Lost Dress of Elizabeth” will begin on 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch has confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed on Friday the long-term rating of Poland in a foreign currency at the level \"A-\" - as set out in the Communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
\"The Fitch Agenda points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-disciplined economy, which is supported by sound economic policy and strong banking sector - we read in the Ministry of Finance's communication.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the cyclical cycle, and in the years 2019-2021 the real rate of growth of the domestic product Brutto in Poland would be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.
The Agency expects that the general government deficit to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below the limit of 3 percent, respectively 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent.
\"The government debt ratio to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent according to the agency and will be lower in the following years (mean of 48.3 percent between 2020 and 2021) - we read.
Saving Poland
The autumn round of reviews of Polish rating on 11 October will end S&P and Moody's.
Polish rescue in the assessment of Fitch remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
At the same time, the agency confirmed the Polish rating at the \"A-\" level with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's creditworthiness is the highest rated Moody's, at the level ‘A2’
Polish rescue according to Fitch and S&P is “A- one level lower than Moody’s.
The perspectives of all assessments are stable.
What's the rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to help investors assess the risk of their investment activities.
Saving is granted to companies, banks and countries.
In the latter case, each evaluation translates into economic attractiveness.
Saving is nothing other than an assessment of credit credibility.
It makes decisions about who and how much to borrow money.
Sometimes such information suggests to whom it is best not to give any credit, because there is a great risk that money will not be recovered.
Lower rating is associated with higher risk.
On the other hand, the higher risk is high interest on the loan.
Any evaluation must be justified and validated.
Saving can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
At this moment, more than 90 percent of the world credit rating services market are controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
‘Confederate Five: First 1000 plus
‘The Confederate Group, i.e. the main establishment of the electoral programme, presented on Friday at the Sejm's Koszalín, which is the 40th district candidate for a mandate from the list of the KW Confederation for Freedom and Independence.
The letter leader to Sejm Krzysztof Chmieleewski presented the password “conscederations of the Confederation Confederate ,
\"First, the 1000+ programme for Poland, secondly rapid and fair courts, third cultural and educational vouchers, for fourth national security, after fifth, this is a healthy life,\" Chmielewski said.
He pointed out that “Policy must finally start making money - that is why the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, “the problem with the tax free amount will solve itself -
“Polaks need to give a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all,” said ZUS leader of the list on the assumptions “ 1000 plus for Poland”
On the other hand, Alexander Zadencka, starting from the second place of the list, referring to the programme password “healthy life”, said that“ living is getting worse and worse - and to change it,“ to support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture, to act for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederate also advocates stopping the “stigmatisation of the hemp of the private hemp. ”
Zadencka declared the support of the Confederation for the “development of natural raw materials construction”
She also expressed herself on behalf of her group as “free vaccinations”
“The right to conscious consent cannot be breached,” she added.
Another candidate for Sejm from the Koshalian district stressed that the Confederation was in favour of ‘ led by a deep judicial reform, whose element should be, among other things, the handling of the case by the judge ‘day after day’
They also argued that the educational subsidy would go to schools without through governments, i.e., according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also behind “the strong Polish army, based on the Polish industry and Polish soldiers -
They stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
According to them, easier access to weapons is also needed.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for ‘ permanent energy access’.
“We can lynch coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy deposits, and we also need to consider a return to the idea of a nuclear power plant,” said Piotr Karpiński.
Head of the Mexican cartel is behind one third of drugs in the United States
Chicago, just after the east of the West Side in Chicago CBS News, there was an emergency on drugs.
Brian McKnight of the Drug Combat Office (DEA) in full light showed what's going on.
Last year in Chicago, almost 800 people died of drug overdose.
McKnight stated that “more likely 90% of drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
\"It is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the US federal executives,\" said Matthew Donahue, the main agent of the DEA in Mexico.
The prize for El Mencho is 10 million dollars.
He helped discover the tens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacition, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of drugs reaching the US by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled “tons, cocaine, methamphetamines and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
For El Mencho's head, there's a $10 million prize.
Ironically, about 30 years ago, he lived in California, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
It's where he created a brutal cartel.
He's got a huge amount of weapons, a RPG, a 50-caliber weapon.
In principle, he owns his own SWAT team - added Donahue.
El Mencho will imperviously protect his empire by using such measures as the shooting of a Mexican helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the cartel brutality led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be handled without protective equipment.
In a cocaine pack lab, it's a smuggler brand.
For more than one third of them, traces lead to El Mencho's cartel.
“It is he who is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children,” said Donahue.
So when someone dies, Donahue thinks there is “a big chance that drugs come from El Mencho.
Over 67 000 Americans died last year of overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the President of France and his wife
27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, claiming French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents that may compromise the president of a couple.
He requested 300 000 euros from the Head of State in a hot tub.
A man born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France at the police station claims to have received documents from a person employed in the Elisha Palace.
During the hearing, he explained that these documents did not only compromise with the president of the couple, but the disclosure of them could in fact threaten the safety of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he requested EUR 300 000 - he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He was in touch with one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from his previous marriage.
According to the defendant's prosecutor, he refused to hand over the police documents he was talking about.
He announced that he would give them to the media, but for now, it is not known whether these documents really existed.
They weren't found in this 27-year-old's apartment.
The male was studied by psychiatric patients, but the physicians did not find any serious problems.
PS4 will be oldskulka - Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more lights on the debuting soon available game only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, as part of the recent presentation of State of Play, announced that the Prime Minister of Squelu The Last of Us would be held in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new part of the breathtaking breath in the chest of gameplay from the upcoming action game.
More specifics were revealed on days after the loud premiere of the part of the game The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are moving on the old-fashioned climates in many respects.
It's decided something we haven't seen in a lot since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Dhabmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a great interview given by The Telegraph, explaining that sequel has spread to one of the most extensive games in history.
“Fabula is ambitious and committed in aspects where the only one was not,” he said.
She must have been so extensive to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the widest game, so it just happened.
\"We are excited to know how many possibilities are in this history, and there will be moments when you think that you are going to end, but you will realize that this is only the beginning and that it begins with a completely new chapter,\" says Printmann.
It's so ambitious that she didn't fit on one BluRayu and she's on two tiles.
Other places have been revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter eggi about adult content (information given by Gamespot).
We're not going to spoil surprises, but the easter eggi are referring to Naughty Dog's old works.
You will find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on 21 February 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of sequel, following the Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which are mentioned above by Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscriptions will also have access to MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to make a pre-premier order for a sequel, Sony stated that there would be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and its bracelet and a 30-centime figure of this cult figure.
Run, squeez and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will make Podbeskid and want to win.
Stomil's ballers from three lines are inconceivable.
Peter Zzyzzkowowski's crew won seven points at this time, because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojnian Chojnice, and in the last match there was a wireless draw in Suwalky.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is exchanged as one of the faworites for the promotion to Extraclassa.
The nearest Stomil rivals take fourth place in the table and they have the advantage of the Olsztyn team.
The Podbeskid played six times this season and counted for two victorys, remissses and failures, however, Stomil is very good at her place - at the stadium at the miłsudski 69nd Peter Zązczezkowski team won three times and lost once.
In total, 17 points were collected in ten lines of the Olsztynian, and they are in the head of the table, although after two failures at the beginning of the game it was not announced.
“Every change needs time to be results,” explains Piotr Skiba.
“And in the end, we were in the middle of something, and we believed in each other, and we can work under normal conditions.
All we did was focus on the ball game.
There are clear heads, there is a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff.
On Tuesday, the Stomil players eliminated the Polish Chorz Movement from the Cup, but they needed games and a series of punishments.
On the south of Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Buchoc did not go to the south of Poland, because coach Zązzzzkowski gave his rest to those key players before Saturday's fight with Podbeskid.
By contrast, in Chorz, he played returning after Jacob Mosakowski’s breakup, who finally shot his long-awaited goal.
“It’s always fun to get a goal, and I’m still at such a time that thanks to this we can continue to play in the cooks (Mosakowski compared to 3:3 in 119 a.m. - red.).
Dad often bit me and laughed that I couldn't get a goal, and I always told him I'd shoot him at a time when he wouldn't expect it.
Now Mosakowski is counting on returning to the primary composition, especially because of yellow cards he can't play the Oréh Tarasanko.
“For this, I am putting on training to be able to play the first composition,” says Mosakowski.
“In Chorz, I did everything I could to present myself as best possible.
But if I play or sit on the reserve bench, I'm still going to be so strongly supportive of the team.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskid.
We will certainly have a hard meeting in which the victory will have to go, go out and fight,
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafal Remis can play, which has recently also played the trauma, so whether he will, we will only find out on Saturday, even more so that the coach of Zązzzkowski traditionally tries to keep a secret until the end of the staff affairs.
A man raped and murdered a nephew.
“ You will never see the light of the day.
You will never breathe in fresh air again,” said Judge Kevin K. Allen, returning to Alex Whipple.
“What you did was so disgusting and mean that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison,” he added.
The five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Its search lasted five days until Whipple pointed out the place to hide the body.
“As someone could have done it to his own niece,” said Dajay Smith, uncle of the girl.
“You are the worst person humanity has to offer” said Alex Whipple.
“ I would give anything to see her again, hug her,” said the mother of a murdered girl.
“Our life will never be the same,” added a broken woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple did not show any emotions during the interrogation.
Last month, he admitted he kidnapped, used sexually and murdered a girl.
A man’s lawyer stated that his client had been raised in “an inadvertent family, ”
He was supposed to be molestered as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to bear the punishment.
A man was sentenced to life without being able to apply for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would give nearly $100 million additional resources to the people affected by droughts.
The scheme providing money to farmers affected by droughts will be extended and the allocation criteria for farm allowances will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost 34 million dollars for the support initiative for drought-affected communities, so eligible for aid to the farm can receive up to 3000 dollars in sudden accidents.
Each of the 13 local regional areas under the Help Programme will receive up to $1 million infrastructure grants and assistance in dealing with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to over $7 billion allocated by the government to the Suction Fund.

An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister in the Silesian Bakers
A personal general trial was carried out prior to the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki at the Silesian Bakery.
\"Dear States, louder, louder, thus we do not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let us scan loudly: Ma-te-usz, encouraged the effortful guide.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiast leader did not bring the expected result.
electoral campaign in progress.
Politicians go all over the country, convincing themselves voters.
Intensive campaign is also conducted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who as leader of the Silesian PiS list is a frequent guest in this region.
Each meeting shall be thoroughly planned, including appropriate repair.
It was also, or rather, should have been in the Silesian Bakers.
A special guest should be welcomed.
Before meeting the Prime Minister, the leader decided to carry out a general test.
He tried to encourage the crowd to scandalize the name of the government chief.
\"This will not be a welcome welcome to me, just for your Prime Minister Mateusz Morawecki!
Also louder, louder, my dearders, encouraged the distinction.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not fully grab a hot lead, and he was eager to answer “Ma-te-usz”, but the recording of an enthusiast leader makes a fury online.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stayers house on 9 July 2014, demanding the disclosure of his wife's residence, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as the Court of Sheriff Harris claims.
Only one member of the family survived, then Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was badly injured, but she was able to recover completely.
On Thursday, the members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of impeccability.
The jury will be remarried on Monday to deliver the sentence.
The quantum Internet is getting closer to reality - ScienceDaily
The results of U.S. military research are moving the quantum internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military security, detection and accuracy of time not available at the traditional approach to network creation.
The Centre for the Distributed Knights of the Processing of Military Research Laboratory for the Development of Movements of the American Army looked at researchers from the University of Insbruck, which managed to achieve a record transfer of the state between matter and light, at a distance of 50 kilometres with the use of fibre cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as kubits.
When two kubits are broken down and measured by one of them, this will affect the measurement made on the other, even if the other cobit is physically separated.
\"Te [50 km] is two rows of size further than previously possible and it is a feasible distance to start building intercity quantum networks,\" said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physics at the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, which was published in Nature magazine, section Quantum Information.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of physical kubits, which are combined despite a large physical distance.
The researchers found that this disassembled state was necessary for the creation of a quantum internet.
\"This demonstration is a major step forward in order to achieve a large-scale spread state\", said Dr. Sara Gamble, a co-founding military program supporting these studies.
The quality of the condition that has been broken down to the second end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult uses of quantum networks.
The research team began an experiment from calcium atom trapped in ionium.
With laser beams, researchers entered quantum status in ion, at the same time encouraging it to issue photons in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, quantum atoms and parts of light have been broken down.
The challenge is to send a photon through a fibre cable.
“Foton emitted by calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometres and is rapidly absorbed by light,” Lanyon said.
Therefore, his team initially sent a part of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The length of the photon wave has been converted to the optimal value from the point of view of transmission to large distances, the current standard wavelength telecommunications length is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon through a 50-inch fibre cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and parts of the light have continued to be broken even after the wavelength has been changed and that the distance has passed.
‘A policy on the choice of calcium means that this result sets a direct path for the creation of a combined network of nuclear clocks at large physical distances, as calcium can be co-operated with high quality co-bit ‘zegar’
The army is very interested in the confused clock nets built on a large scale because of the application for precise position setting, precise navigation and time synchronisation,” said Dr Fredrik Fatemi, military researcher, who also co-ordinates the program.
