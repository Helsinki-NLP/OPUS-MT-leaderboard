What will happen? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemorta or the diabetes plant
The new ČSSD councillors will have to overcome a certain language barrier in Prague, and they will have to understand their old colleagues from ODS in the representative of Prague.
Deník Current.cz members of the new ČSSD Council have tried, as they know the notorically established Slang, which has been established in the city hall in recent years when Prague ruled the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague political trail introduced during the previous era of Mayor Paul Béma, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and kauz in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turns out that new councillors don't understand too much.
At least he says so.
-Who's Voldemort?
I don't really know--
“I am in Prague’s policy a novice,” he responded to the ‘Kmotrov’ test - dictionary councillor for the culture of Luke Kaucky.
And although it is a political vet, he reacted similarly to Councilman Karel Břečin.
For example, the term ‘golf apples’
“This is the only expression from those you present to me, which I sometimes use--
I generally don't recognize Jinak Slang
From a dictionary, whose terms of the daily journal were published this June before the ODS election congress, she selected six examples, mostly those that are notorically associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists were to explain the concepts of the Voldemort - the largest golf hole in Prague - to go to the sugar shop - the bull's arrows - the council of the capital - and to keep the city alive
Trojice of the Council with the candlestick agreed, fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to be head of Prague education for the future - first promised an interview, later he did not take the phone.
The fifth councilman Petr Dolínek rejected the test.
“I do not discuss these things at all and how civil Democrats are having fun, I will not judge.”
\"I am now addressing how we will understand within our programmes,\" he responded.
As mentioned earlier, counsellor Luke Kaucky would not say in the title above that there was a talk of a powerful businessman and friend of the exprimator Bém Romana Janošk.
“Voldemort” is not saying anything to Kaucka and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is “the largest golf hole in Prague”:
“It is the tunnel of Blanka,” says Kaucky, and immediately adds: “But I know it more from the paper.
I'm gonna have to pay for some language course, - he's joking.
The Golf Jam then, as a tunnel of Blanka, deciphers not only the Matador Karel Břečin but also the councillor for the environment of Luke Plachý.
Both social Democrats know who is really Voldemort, and Luke Placho is well aware of where to find this character - the considerable meaning of expression - to go to the sugar shop.
“I think that means going to a Prague business,“ it’s a sailing near the separation that it’s about the headquarters of Janoske’s companies.
In agreement with March, he reminds us that he drew knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
There is no such thing as a slang dictionary in social democracy according to the frequency test.
- I've been with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like this.
“We call it names, sometimes shorts and zkolony names are used,” says ČSSD Petr Hulínský, the chairman of the Prague ČSSD, who is called Hulda.
\"I've been told by the Breza at school, but I don't know if they call me colleagues,\" says Karel Marchin's own nickname.
Deník Currently.cz the name tried and works.
Councilman Weinert is a grandfather or less friendly grandfather, a representative of Miroslav Poche, who pointed out fraud in the sponsoring of the party before his election, has a nickname-Igráček with some colleagues.
The revisions are also the only thing social Democrats in the intra-strategic talk are letting go.
Hullinski said Hulda does not like it, but the journal has recorded another nickname of this Prague President.
“Doctor of Obscendiary Law” recalls that Petr Hulínský gained his title as JUDr. at the bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of Christian workers, published a booklet
Women declared in Burkina Faso have several common characters.
Rather, they belong to an older generation, cannot be involved in work, for example for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
The witch is being sent to isolation in order not to threaten the rest of the village.
“It is rare to have this fate.
“They are not even young healthy women because they help in working and having children,” describes the order nurse who, in the capital city of Burkina Faso, is taking care of more than one hundred women in a special house that their communities have fired from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against an unusual-social measure.
She gave out an information booklet that should help the witch chase.
The thing is, it's a catch.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” pointed out the disadvantage of a written Auschwitz journal Die Standard.
In other African countries, crime from witchcraft is common.
In Ghana, who and Burkina Faso neighbored last week died of a twenty-six-year-old Ammy Hemmahova after three women and two men tortured her with pepper and burned.
He informed the BBC server about the case.
The Pachales claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual lubrication has been lit.
It was said that after the group wanted to bring forth the evil spirit,
Isolation - Christian - support people regardless of the level of education they have achieved.
Deník Der Standard quoted a two - four - year - old businessman from Burkina Faso: “The human souls eaters have always been in danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the witch hunt is trying to peace the government, in Gamba, he was attended by the President himself last year.
“Gambij President Jammí, after the death of his aunt, launched a large hunt to witches who were supposed to participate in her death and try to kill the President himself through black magic.”
“To help himself, he invited shamans from nearby Guinea who accompanied police officers, soldiers and personal guards of the President, violently brought back selected men and women from the gambiian villages on the President’s farm in Kanila,” said Amnesty International in her report.
In the farm, people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused bowel and renal problems.
Two prison stays on the farm didn't survive.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand people were released free at last.
Bakal's tenant: Tops in stones, signed higher rents
Older subordinate man stepped out of the client center of the company RPG Flats -uhlobarona - Zdeňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arms he carried a file and a new lease to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three of them just picked up their rent.
Instead of 3500 a month from next year, the son will pay for apartment 2+1 second category of CZK 4100.
\"And it is not hot water there, and it has to be toasted with peppers (a stone for rigid fuel, ad.),\" says a man by his finger in the son's new contract, whose signature has full power.
But I signed it,\" explains half of it, and half of it is replenished.
The Civil Society of BytyOKD.cz, whose new lease conditions have been identified as non-corrective and immoral, advises tenants not to sign up and wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man has a hand over it.
“One says that, the other one, the one that cares.
Ostrava becomes a large laboratory deregulation.
After the new year, a large majority of apartments still have unsustainable rental in the Czech Republic awaits.
At present.cz decided to visit thelaboratory in person.
The Hawaiian waiting room RPG is one of four in Ostrava and it's already full on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m.
Right next to the door, there's a security guard from the security agency, and there's a launch device on it.
-Today 2011, a special button on its touch screen is lit.
One tap, and the machine leaves the paper with the number.
You will not be able to read -157 - and your cifra is already drinking on a large display under the waiting ceiling.
You're up in half a second.
After a while, he comes to ask the older couple, but he's obviously not touching new rents at all.
Most people have come to deal with common problems like others - requests for correction, insurance events and so on.
The letters with new lease contracts are made in Ostrava to the post office tenants of most of the total 44 000 apartments portfolio of RPG from mid-November.
The RPG Flats in their letters suggest an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special switch to new rents was opened at the customer center on November 18th.
\"It's been over a week, so it's only in the end,\" the workers are responsible for overflowing after a while when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local sensitive theme.
Before the elections, he was very eagerly chosen by the Vice-President of Parliament and the Australian family Lubomír Zaorárek from the ČSSD, and now the local newspaper is full of it.
- Twenty years after them I want a new floor -
- I don't think they've changed my toilet record, - he's relieved in the opening of a mentioned man.
Most so far, according to the workers, pensioners are coming to see if they get a discount from rent if they sign on time as RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half the discount on February's rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
Haviřovská-deregulation - the obstacle, but the questions are definitely not covered.
“From yesterday, 360 clients here because of the 2011 rent, there were only about 40 to fifty people,” they estimate the workers for the bulkhead.
At the same time, the RPG on the web and its texts proposes an individual negotiation of contracts where it will be necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
“It is not a threat, but information about only possible and completely legitimate legal action,” notes RPG on his website.
“No one will judge here,” he thinks one of the workers of RPG Apartment and the man on the street before the client center gives her partly for the truth.
“I have 13 thousand pensions and I have five thousand left to eat, I have no reason to judge,” he says.
But then, the workers are just taking their chances.
-We'll see--
“Mr. Zaorálek sends them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait,” he considers.
The regulation of rents ends in the majority of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011, and according to RPG Flats, their economic necessity is to increase.
“The existing rental still does not reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,” recalls Pavel Klimesh, the director of the RPG Apartment residence portfolio, that the very angry tenant of the housing fund is the main reason for the homeowners to increase rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG from rents could invest in flats of four billions, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
The large-scale screen hanging across the ceiling opposite the porous haviřova waiting room has so far repeated several redly highlighted information.
-The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, that's more than 90% of apartments inRPG.
-And it will always be the most about 7,50 CZK per square metre and a month, - it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will be raised by 38 percent.
In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19,66 CZK per square metre, - warns RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Flats promises that deregulation will not take the bait off, but will be broken down within four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to the flats, mainly into thermal savings - new windows and warming.
Predictably, they are to get people who sign the agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include kindergartens, architects understand
The administrative building of Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.D sign.
No one would expect that he also hides a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys, and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, she can attend the children of Arch.Design's employees.
The design-architectonic company Arch.Design, from its studios, has built a number of important Brno buildings, counted with the space for its business mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of the baby and cares for women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Together with the option of short-time work, the benefit school, which Arch.Design offers its employees under the social programme.
So farmers and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding work with care for a child.
The minischools themselves invented the employees of Arch.Design and managed to obtain subsidies from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs with the support of the leadership.
The Fire Minister is funded by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme and the Czech Republic's State Budget.
Thanks to grant funding (the grant amount of CZK 2,8 million) could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
Following the exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design has an obligation for 3 years to operate a minischool for its own costs.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the grant applications were significantly supported by Economy Rating.
The care provided by qualified staff, care for children all day long by the nurse and teacher of the Ministry, so they can walk children without age, yet most of them over 3 years old.
As it is a ‘miniscule’, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will be held during the day.
The operation of kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme filling in the minischool is comparable to the preschool framework programme.
Children not only play here but also provide quality teaching - from basic recognition to preparation for school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, exciting games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may at any time check their children and suffer stress situations with delayed picking up children from school leaving their parents' work.
This makes parents use of working time more productive.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal relationship between employees - employers.
Arch.Design has thus included himself with Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees are friendly to the family and through this program he has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house is fascinating after 100 years. Look inside of Gaudí's interior.
The roof looks like the back of a great lizard, the stairwell resembles the spine of dinosaur and the balconies are open with fish mouth.
This is Casa Batlló's house in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, the house, thanks to its organic shapes, served the nickname of the House of Bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, fasad resembling skews and ominous soft curves, that's all typical for secess Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house is played by snow lines, soft colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
When observed in detail, you can see the geometry, rhythm, and the carefully thought order.
In the night, the whole fasd of the house sounds even more dramatic, it's astonished to be the impression of the light of color even more powerful.
It is also visible in the interiors and the twisting of shapes with the same measure.
The wood in waves is copying window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, puppets and rails.
The Batlló house, which stands in the Eixample district on Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was built to rebuild the house from 1877 from the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on breaking old buildings and building completely new, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló's house was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
The decoration for representing apartment owners and the use of mosaics on the fassad was created on its designer board.
A number of other artists and artists worked on the fassad.
The joint work at the top of Casa Batlló's house started a successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Gaudí house Casa Milá and the Park Güell, where there are other Gaudí works.
From the locals, the house has earned weight after completion thanks to its organic shapes of nickname - Houses from the bone -
Others have started calling it a “win house” because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalan is like the sword of St. George.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculpture elements of the construction.
Gauds to the house designed for their time a unique central heating system with weather breaks and typical chimneys.
The bizarre may seem their 40 degrees slope.
In Gaudí’s creation, he did not absolutely respect these building regulations and did not allow them to bond.
At the beginning of the construction, although the building permit was obtained from the city, the information on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the town council was born and asked for correction.
For example, the Council held an issue in favour of the construction of Pillars as well as in the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only fifteen days after the call of the city part, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into a lower floor.
There was a social salon on the second floor and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground was rented jeweling.
The entire six-storey house is pierced by a stairwell that can be blown up to a single roof terrace.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were to remove all right angles and direct lines and replace them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
A social part can be fully connected by opening the living doors and a larger company can communicate with each other without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facades, Gaudí's house has also gained unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is surrounded by the inner yard, and lights.
The game of two colors adds the maximum light in all the floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflect the light more than dark, which in turn absorbs the sun rays.
Casa Batlló's house, which was included in Unesco's World Heritage Fund in 2005.
On the first floor of the house is the most simple and powerful apartment made available to the public.
The owners decided for this step until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of a hundred fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
For the tour, they insisted, because they found that this was a very beneficial business, and they extended their tours to common and sub-circuit spaces, including roof terraces.
The entrance to the monuments is certainly not negligible, makes 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist license holders have a 20 percent discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of entry to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly make friends with some of the owner's inhabitants and visit it at home.
How to choose mattresses and grots: Women have requirements other than men
There's no matching bed frame, but the quality of lighting the area, i.e. mattresses and grilles, giving the foundation of a really good bed.
However, it must be harmonised to meet specific users.
When choosing, there are many things, from weight, height, age, health status and gender owners.
Also important is the type of interior to which mattresses and grills are taken.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages where they don’t drown regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they slow down - they are warmer -
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn on regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid board, they're holding moisture: the fungus could appear underneath them.
There is also a habit when choosing.
Who has spent longer time abroad, where they often use a lot of high mattresses with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on the low and with the hard surface.
“Although all the hockeymen who came back from the NHL complained that they would not sleep here.
“On their lean shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft layer of lazy foam -
“This is also recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system disorders, so they misinterpret ,information - from joints and skins,” explains Sylva Hadamychková, who specializes in granulated furniture.
A lot of hockey, but even other customers, therefore, a mattress with a lazy foam was running.
“Today it’s cool, suitable mattress has to have Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico -
You don't have to be a fighter from the NHL to appreciate the lazy foam.
This - miracle works simply.
Optimalizes its rigidity and shape according to absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing's pushing you, you're not going to turn around at night like you're having a hard fight.
You'll just sleep better.
It also works as a protection against elongation.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height add a length of feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of around 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in double bed, i.e. 180 cm.
For single beds such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm are recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
“Jinak is a rule for the width of the bed simple: when lying on the back you should have hands comfortablely covered in the elbow, “radi Ing. Helena Prokopová, characteristic of the Cechu čalouřů and decorativeůch that has devoted the problem of healthy sleeping and ergonomie furniture for many years and present it in professional schools.
In the double bed, every single one needs its own grill and mattresses, but here watch the purchase to freshen the heights of mattresses.
Otherwise, nothing else will be left to put the grills in different heights, but it doesn't have to happen to you on every bed frame.
The foam mattress should have a height of at least 14 cm, a type with a spring bone of at least 15, of which at least three censors should be counted on the shape and hip coating.
“You must not feel the spring when touching your hands or sitting on your mattress,” warns Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Whole bed, when mattresses and substrates are like grown siamese twins, they don't have what to do in bedrooms.
The mattresses fail, they cannot be washed out, which is already common today.
And since during the night we normally meet 0.2 to 0,75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and cut) net.
That is why experts refuse advertising slogans about mattress life for up to 25 years, or even lifelong guarantees.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, advice from sales practices: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and the work of a sensory coating do not give up, but please add a mattress protector, which you can easily take and wash.
Even though today's mattresses are commonly produced, we get two parts (for washing and washing size of washing machines very important!), yet it could be manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when we are reading to remember the struggle of light weights in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid board in bed instead of a grill?
Never!
Maximum to bed intended for visits to one night.
However, you will be provided (if it has no more) with ventilation holes and use a spring bone mattress and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschen Federn) and a hipping layer.
Polyurethane mattress doesn't belong to such a substrate.
There will be 14 to 18 lamels suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (three combination of latex and coconut), but you will always get more lamels with more lamels, 28 or more, where lamelas are doubled in the area of the bed and can be regulated.
There's no mattress with the spring bone on the positioning bench because they're not responding to the positioning.
In addition to the tuhosti lamel setting, the so-called shoulder collar can be added.
It's a special cunning of the lamel, which allows you to push or even lean on the lamel so that the shoulder has a spattered nice - bluish -
For men who have a “ramen over the whole back,” a very important thing.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses already remember it, who started using the softening zone in the area of arms.
Women remember also - they recapture softer surfaces in places of hips.
For the most demanding customers, wings or wafers are designed with so-called multi-torsting.
The pressure is spread to multiple points and the voltage is reduced.
Be careful, however, once you apply to the right mattress and the grill of the bad pillow (big and “taped” - most of the “plus” - disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow has to scratch the head and tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, it is recommended that 50 x 60 cm are preferred for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be compared (with the shoulder knee of the grill or soft zone in the mattress) with the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original beams filled with grasses.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least a device.
Trend is just a bio mattress.
The raw materials of which the polyurethane foam is produced are replaced by natural oils, for example from the cup and the soy.
The soy is just using all the well-known manufacturers.
“Bio at the mattresses means that the core is made of materials of purely natural origin,” explains Petr yours from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also wish the microcapsle to release fresh scents of the forest or lavender.
There is also distribution for men and women.
While a man is cold-watering plant extract from the belly to absorb the nature of mattresses warmly and cooled the body, women's heels - drowns -
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so it's weaker sex gay.
Today's favorite?
A mattress made of cold foam (has larger pores with a broken cell structure, is so much more simple than normal polyurethane and offers better flexibility.
A combination of different fats of cold foam and water - foams are created by multi-zone mattresses, which know exactly where to be head, bed and heels.
For quality mattresses, you will pay from 7.000 crowns and higher.
Those who meet the health parameters have lower VAT rates are taken as medical aids.
He first achieved this advantage in the Czech Republic Gumotex.
It's not easy to save on mattresses and grate.
Sometimes it is possible to use the events of manufacturers or sellers offering two mattresses at the price of one.
Perhaps the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattress with all the memory foam of Memory to the stretch for 11 990 crowns.
However, the second can be ordered free of charge.
Era lazy or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and high density has started with the Tempur material.
He appeared originally as a material for NASA because at the start, astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
The temperature is warmly soft, and the cold is on the contrary.
The warm human body will adapt perfectly and decomposition its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of elongated but also to increase comfort during sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example, on special pillows under the legs that drain the legs and the venous system.
The domestic producers use e.g. the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
People want more and more parents to see, so they want to share their children.
Fear of own child brings more and more people to the idea of watching over GPS.
The system originally created for car search can also follow people's movements, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anika Jantková.
The device is probably large as a sulphur box, but soon it can only be big as a watch.
A number of people scared the missing Anička case and started drinking in the middle of how to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of disturbing their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that it is not a spying, but another means to reduce the probability of becoming some tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of tracking equipment on the Czech market.
“I admit that, in some cases, there may be an abuse of such devices, such as when they fit in someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case.”
“All customers buy it for safety reasons,” said Pilin.
According to him, a child should always know the purpose of a ‘crabber’ used and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Baby psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
“And very little children prove great creativity in how some things are deliberately lost when they don’t want to be under control.
“The great expectations have previously been triggered by parents with mobile phones, which can be disabled as well as these tracking devices,” says Bočková.
According to her, it is also disputed whether it would actually help in the event of an assault.
“In terms of a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child has no electronics for himself, which could reveal his location.
- Now it's a phone--
“When the tracking equipment begin to expand, they will also look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by a massive advertising.”
“In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, it admits that such equipment can help in the event of an inadvertent attack on pedophile.
According to Robert Bohemia from RC Monitoring, which offers monitoring services for both cars and for persons, even if it occurs after an attack to immediately destroy the tracking device, its presence can help.
The device can be set for regular dispatch of the position after a certain period of time.
The person concerned shall be at least the last position of the person concerned if his damage has occurred.
“Aging device is also designed with inclinations, so even if you just slip and stay still lying, the device will send a warning immediately with the position,” says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service can also take smart mobile phones with navigation, where special software can be recorded.
The problem of current tracking units is that it is either a device similar to that of a box of sulphur or smaller mobile phones.
They're always so at risk of losing them.
According to the Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why it is now testing devices that look like normal digital watch.
‘This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that any aggressor does not have to know the tracking device at all’
\"Or he will recognize them after some time and can give the police extra time,\" he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are developed in bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology as used for car safety.
This is a combination of surveying the location via GPS (which uses normal autonavigation) and mobile phone functions, which the current position of the vehicle reporting.
The army has tanned cords that would be pierced by the Czech Republic but only two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of cords to launch the cracks.
Last year, the Defense Department added a string of 224 kilometers in stock.
Vojsko has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is, the durability of the cord is two, for a maximum of four years.
The army bought burnt cords from the STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justification for buying such a huge amount of burnt cord MF DNES, wrote that soldiers use 60 kilometres per year during training.
However, from the calculations of military Pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, it shows that then very intensive pyrotechnic training would have to go through all generals, officers of military command, secretaries or maids each year.
Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and Commander of the Army Vlastimil Pick is not an exception.
It would just be possible to justify the annual consumption of the army of 60 kilometres of ligament.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were, the army's supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that the basic training of each new professional is sufficient at most two metres of burnt cords, as experts say, and the army has provided for fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of iron or special units - supplies on the above 225 years.
The soldiers have recently complained about the rapid deployment of the Minister Vondr that they have almost no bullets in hand weapons, so they are also limited by the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
“It doesn’t bother me so much that they buy so many matches from us repeatedly--
But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they're going to do to them.
“For us, the army is a good customer to whom we are trying to meet as businessmen,” says the commercial manager STV Group Jan Děcky.
The spokesperson of the Defence Department Jan Pejšek justifys hundreds of kilometres of purchased cords, even by having supplies of this House for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcky of STV Group is talking about only four years of life in the basaltion and police or military pyrotechnics for even two years.
“In perfect storage, it can be the four,” says one of them, who, as a soldier because of the criticism of the army, does not want to publish a name.
After the end of life, each ammo must carefully test whether it is still reliable and does not threaten soldiers for life.
These tests, however, are not free and cost more money.
Another argument by the Ministry is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometres of burnt cords.
“We were about 60 percent less than last year’s delivery of two hundred and forty miles [40 km],” the interpreter Pejšek said the buyer’s opinion to the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of the firearms of police Pyrotechnics, which destroy the ammunition from the Second World War or here after the Soviet Army, has not been more than a few years of 1500 metres.
And the police always order just enough to consume this ammo before the end of life.
It has proved to her because of the safety of the Pyrotechnics, and can also be more flexible to gain more modern and therefore more reliable type of cord.
The Ministry of Defence has already had considerable difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand thousand thousandths of Czechoslovakia prepared to sail to the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the Pyrotechnics which MF DNES addressed, awaits the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of miles of old liquefiers, which today’lacino’ shopping.
To this day, I'm getting the contacts that I've gained from the competition.
The winning place in the competition The Living Year helped Luke Pytloun when selling his hotel francs.
The winner of the last year's competition became an eight-year-old businessman Luke Pytloun from Liberec.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And in abroad, he realized that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From the savings from foreign Brigád and through bank credit, he bought a half-circled house with five apartments.
At the time, he was a student of the third year of college, that was a great courage.
“The ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation in our house did not give me to try to do something about it,” says Luke Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to rent foreign workers.
All profits invested back in the house, which gradually transferred to a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, he gradually managed to open four guesthouses in Liberec in seven years, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with overall capacity over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most unfortunate of them was recently four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But he got another one this year, same quality.
“We have a signed contract with the hotel in Ostrov near Tisé, where we sold our franshezing concept and other interested parties about the French hotels Pytloun reported itself,” says last year's article number one.
“And in this sale of a hotel license with great measure was the victory in the competition of the Living Year,” adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“The people met me in the streets, and often congratulations to me in addition, and I must say that it was pleasant,” she recalls.
Participation in the competition certainly recommends to all who are trying to do something.
There is no need to win, every visibility is good.
He says he's running out of contacts and knowledge he might not have gotten anywhere else.
I started trading regularly with some of the contests I met.
The glory associated with success, according to him, came a little on every employee.
And that he's got about 70.
“I can see more loyalty and pride in their participation in something that has gained general recognition.
“It is not far from my personal success, it is the result of good work to all of us together.”
“Only my name is placed in the front,” says Luke Pytloun today.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has quickly replaced the consequences of the crisis.
But Farmet has worse times over thanks to the goal of the winner's consciousness.
For the first place in the last year's competition Vodafone The company of the year came to the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský.
The jury then appreciated the efforts it built from a small tool workshop in the Czech Skalicice company with a hundred million turnover.
“I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our confidence in the fight against competition,” says the winner of last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, it was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered to father Karl Žďárský to rent a small workshop as compensation for communists who were killed, he didn't hesitate, rejected his career in a company where he worked at that time, and with some friends around his dad, they founded a company on plastic tub.
Soon afterwards, they began to specialize in vegetable oil foxes.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic foxes in Central Europe.
The company became more familiar and independent after its success in the competition through the media.
“Our customers began to understand Farmet’s brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they cooperated with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
The past year, however, was not only a sign of euphoria from victory in Farmet.
The evaluation was based on the economic results of the company until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the hardest year for the sale of mechanical goods.
The crisis that has not yet been affected by the citizens has been in the process, but the companies have already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict the purchase of new machines and technologies.
Of course, this situation has not been avoided by us either.
“We had to reduce production by 40 percent, and we also had to release,” explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to make such unpopular measures.
But the situation was done and they kept the company profitable, even though less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not benefit from in Farmet is investment in research and development.
“From the subsidies we have built a research and training centre, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, gained the main awards in home shows,” says Žďárský.
All of them testify that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are increasing again and with them the number of new employees.
“I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel Žďárský.
Insofar as it removes absurd regulations
The fourth part of the business line on Absurdite of the year is the second part of the business.
Some ridiculous regulations have already been cancelled.
An infamous winner of the next year's survey of Absurdity of the year has become an obligation to wear documents that are accessible online to officials.
It decided more than a third of less than four thousand voters.
For example, social security management required a paper copy from the trade register, even if an official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the incident, it'll change.
The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a statement from the Commercial Register during the checks on insurance payers,” said ČSZ Jan Buranová.
To shine on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfill, and the nonsense is the meaning of the Absurdita competition of the year.
This year, the fourth part of the business line organized by the Economic paper has been 4 years since the public enjoys more and more pleasure.
If the vote took place last year, about 3,000 votes had already been held this year.
And there is no wonder that various legal obligations that serve only to keep business are still enough for us.
We are at the leading places in the world, including Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Workers of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the subject of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed its 74th position in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity competition of the year was first announced in 2006 and carried out annually according to the same scenario.
To declare administrative and bureaucratic nonsense, anyone can log out every year from April to the end of September when the competition is closed.
To apply, the website address of www.jaroku.cz will then be selected by the organiser of the competition by seven candidates for ‘anticene’, and will allow the public to vote over the Internet during October on www.jaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihed.cz.
Absurdity, who gets the most votes wins.
To this year, more than a hundred regulations, more precisely 105 regulations and a regulation that stole sense.
Tips sent entrepreneurs, as well as trade unions and journalists.
For example, the ‘finalists’ competition has been required, for example, to ensure that vehicles for the maintenance of highways and speed roads pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven designs is published on the competition site.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place at the beginning of November at the Václav Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning which regularly takes part in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svoboková, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Employees of the Czech Republic or Petr Kžel, President of the Czech Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
“The economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws its hats under its feet, so it is my goal to cancel at least three dozens of paragraphs every year, which today only lacks business,” said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to disturb the ridiculous order doesn't seem empty.
In 2007, the main obligation for entrepreneurs to report three days ahead of the trade office in the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention of taking a stand at the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by the amendment of the trade law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was announced by the Labour Office for its foreign staff business trip to up to 30 days, was removed by law on the so-called Green Card.
And a third of everything good.
Absurdity of 2009 became a regulation of physiotherapy to have a large mirror, refrigerator, and two heavy weights in the office.
This year, the decree of the Ministry of Health has been reduced - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are assessed.
This year's news of the fifth year of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of 2010.
Supporting sound and fair business is a way to put forward this competition.
“We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, who is the publisher and competition guarantee as well as in the case of a rebel competition of the year.
Until this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company 2010 came to the company for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each one of them is very inspiring and would put on a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities differs from the second diametrically, aid and discretion may be considered to be common denominators.
In one case, for example, people affected and others need personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Between 14 celoreblik finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Nitter, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a series of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the company responsible from the Pardubic Region is Isolit-Brava, which has been the main contributor of the grant fund to the hendikeped children for 17 years.
A paper from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent, has received the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region and in Vodafone Company held in the region as third.
On Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft has won a flexible work period, which has even reduced to average 35 hours per week but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also gave her a note that she prefers to buy from Czech producers, promotes civil activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
“We are trying to recycling as much as possible so that our business and administration have as little impact on the environment as possible,” explains Mr Ryznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the U.S. region also thinks about the health of its employees and has ordered ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and at its corporate events, using catering services provided by a local protected workshop.
“We support this in a distress that helps the local Roma community specifically,” says the representative of Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to its employees through default bonuses.
“We are reinventing on food, transport, increasing qualifications and recreation,” says Josef Strapáč from the British construction company Time, winner of the Moravian Region.
All the regional finalists of Vodafone Company of the year, who answered the question of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the category of Responding Company by 15 August at the latest.
Furthermore, incorrect or incomplete questionnaire replies were removed from the evaluation.
“If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer questions, they could not participate in the competition The responsible company of the year, but they are not disqualificated from the “main” competition of Vodafone Company of the year -
The main competition of the company is not possible,” explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose series of organizers.
On the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested the competition.
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days, anti-corruption police have been arrested.
The detectives put local entrepreneurs in the media sector and businessmen with the achievements of Luboshi G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the currently ongoing public competition to deal with the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would receive a specific interest.
That's what Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for.
“Now I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the change in the public contract and in the competition,” said Pravu head of the Plzen State Representation of Antoni Zelená, saying that further details cannot be provided in the light of the ongoing investigation.
Six-four-year-old policemen released their freedom after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum of official information, it is only possible to speculate on how he could influence the public competition.
The spokesperson of the International Fund Lubomír Black, on the question of the Rights, stated that the police were indeed involved in a separate workplace in Pilsen during the public competition.
“One thing about a client, not our employee, ” she specified.
According to the Black Competition, the right name is to offer land transfer entitlements according to the Land Act, and is held when more eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
‘These persons, within the framework of the challenge, offer a higher value for their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the property,
Under offered claims, the order of the acquirers and the Land Fund will then transfer the property to the person who offered the highest claims,” explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. had probably had information which came to the challenge, and since he was also a legitimate person, as he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to be interested in the land that he would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he's been incapacitating.
That would explain that he had so much money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had above-standard PF contacts in Pilsen in the past.
He worked in the case of former Chief PF Václav Sankot, who was punishing himself for issuing at the replacement residence of the land on which the construction decision had already been given.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired land from the Fund, for example, to build public communications, specifically in a place where the arrival magistrala was to build into the Borska field industrial zone.
Later it was very beneficial to exchange it with the magistrate behind the house in the historical center itself, which had a much higher value.
Then the city hall had to enter it, because otherwise it would jeopardise the blocking of the land.
Accommodation grants hundreds of dollars per month
Homelessness will have to be paid not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and congestive, heat supplies and weeds.
Families will have to pull out of their wallet from January to hundreds of crowns a month more than they are now.
The electricity will scratch up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to 10 in some cities you will have to pay for the supply of water and often the supply of central heat.
Acquisition of electricity should be a year's worth of a carcass than it is now.
While all major suppliers have decreased their prices, there is therefore a significant increase in energy production support from renewable sources, especially photosvoltaics.
Gas will be a little more expensive, but at a time when people are most drowning and have the highest consumption.
It must therefore also count on hundreds of extra crowns annually.
While electricity and gas are scratching across the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, the house in Pardubice or Hradec Kralove will pay about 50 crowns per month from January for central heating, more than 1000 crowns per year will be paid to families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague are also threatened by more than 9 percent of water and contaminants, in the event that the city increases its rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, it'll pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the celerepublik comparison between the lower.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it has a watery and repellent charge of 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices can increase in 450 thousand rent apartments, where regulation has ended since January.
For example, CPI Flats, which owns around 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, intends to increase the rent rate by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new challenge are going to put the company in court.
The regulated revenue paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase by up to 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is made of fashion, effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally and better sign of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks after which drinking ends most often in the care of drunk doctors who have not yet been 15 years old.
An exception are not children who are treated repeatedly from the monkey.
This results in the experience of doctors who face similar cases at children's hospitals.
“Some beers or wine are completely unblue, because it takes a long time to get drunk”
“Trend is certainly a hard drink,” said the First Head of Child Hospital Hořovice in the middle of Bohemia Luděk Pelikán.
“If they can pull a bottle of Daddy out of the closet, it's about a whiskey, otherwise it's a fernet and vodka.
“The Vodka has the advantage of putting her in juice and not feeling so much of it,” explained the Prime Minister.
And for the truth, the spokesperson of Motol Eva Jurin's Faculty Hospital also gives him the speaker.
The most common is fernet or rum -
“This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools,”
“In some cases, it was the slivovice they brought from home,” said Jurin.
According to Mayor Pelicana, 13 or 14-year-old pirates are a relatively common phenomenon.
Before Hořovice, where he's been operating since this year, he's been working for the paediatric population in Motole for ten years, where ambulances have been keeping underage schoolers from a wide area.
“One girl in our house was lying about four times.
“Kariéru began in twelve years when she was brought to us with 3.5 promile of alcohol in the blood, plus in combination with ecstasy,” the physician described a particularly serious case.
“She was at a show in Holesovice at some dance party -
“The interesting thing is that her mother did not find it odd that she did not know about her daughter for 48 hours,” said the principal.
I am not interested in parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing child drunkness.
However, addiction in the right sense cannot be spoken according to experts in children.
- Under the name of an alcoholic, several years of chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomones that belong to it, and that is not the case in children.
“In those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more likely that the family-social background is unfamiliar,” explained Prime Minister Pelikán.
According to Jurin's spokesperson, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the Motole clinic this year in mid November.
But statistics only get to those with severe intoxication that had to stay in the hospital.
Children's drunks, who take their parents after an ambulant treatment, or if they're delivered home to the police, don't count at all.
In addition to the cases where children sit down after school and drink the bottles of bees, there are three seasonings according to Pelikan to which they can rely: witches, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
“This is either aloud of bad convictions, or they celebrate the beginning of the holiday.
I saw seven drunks on the witch’s income and seven young drunks at the same time.
The monkey who spends the night detoxicating under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in benefit from the one who spends the next day at home an unpleasant hangover.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are caused by an infancy infusion with glucose and nutrients missing by the organism.
“They are actually better at it because they have a beautiful evening experience and a good wake, and nothing hurts them. ”
“Only they are confused about where they are,” admits Pelikán, with the fact that sometimes failures in patients with a pleasant mood, at least by calculating the costs they requested.
The transport of an ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will also go to tens of thousands of crowns.
“I used it at times as an educational device when I directly to those children then calculated on the vision how much their drunkity was and that they could also spend the whole summer on the camp to earn a single party,” Pelikán added.
However, health insurance companies, according to him, are regressive in which after parents the cost of treatment would not be used, in the case of child drunkers.
Two aircraft L-159 are for the first time in a foreign hand in Spain
Two aircraft L-159 of the total five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced Casa C-295M's transport aircraft, on Tuesday they flew to the Spanish Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS.
It is the first time the machines of this type appeared in ownership of someone other than the Czech army.
In abroad, they were only in exercises or for years.
This is a two-digit version of L-159T1, which has been operated by the Czech army and which has been letusable.
The remaining three machines are one-local L-159.
So far, they're being preserved in Aeru Vodochody and the broker of the trade - Omnipol - they've been taken over last week.
When airplanes physically perform from Vodod, according to John Pejška is not known from the Press Defense Department yet.
‘One of the L-159 aeroplanes for the exchange have been removed from long-term deposits and investments by the Ministry’s branch, without any further deposits and investments.
The two-local L-159T1 were mixed in the current state and form,” said Pejšek.
He added that the army would not remain without two-digit aircraft because the Ministry in May 2009 signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the construction of four non-consumption L-159 machines for two-digit machines.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the other will take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejška, the EADS has committed that the aeroplanes are going to plant some allied countries in the arms.
The agreement clearly states that the aircraft collector L-159 is the EADS company and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
“There is, therefore, a customer’s business, how it will be realized,” said Pejšek.
The Economics no longer stated that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159 is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one aircraft Casa and the purchase of another three aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion has been approved by the Government of Mirka Topolánka last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for a selection procedure and addressed the EADS directly.
These defense leaders argued that the shift would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army has bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would want to sell.
The purchase of Casa's planes is likely to have a court record.
For the European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence has sued in the European Court because it had aircraft to choose on the basis of a pan-European tariff and not by addressing one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at the Kbely Prague airport during the 14 days.
Longer display than ring marks a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a display longer than a ring are exposed to a lesser risk of being sick with prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
“Our results show that the relative length of finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men up to 60 years,” said the co-author of study Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The hair could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Elels added.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients with more than 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had a sign on their right hand shorter than the ring.
She paid them the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were equally long.
In the case of those who had a display longer than the ring, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men to 60, the decrease in even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - apparently reflects different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer display.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is supporting growing prostate cancer.
The chief Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that he knew about this study at a time, but he did not seem to know that the relationship between length of fingers and cancer would be fully demonstrated.
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
In the roads and pedestrians, mostly the snow was eaten, the roads in many places drove all night.
The morning D5 motorway between 89 and 93 km is closed in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of both trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
Reported to say it was the Central Automotoclub (OAMK).
At 9 miles [91 km], there was a truck crash, two trucks hit a mile [93 km], and the accident asked for injuries.
A few personal cars ended in the ditch.
Problems are also on D1 motorway at 185 kilometers in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks went down there.
Drivers should drive just after Brno at 190 miles or ride across Brno and then ride at 182. miles per Kývalce.
There's a number of squares in there.
Also on D11 motorway is an accident, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there are several inches of snow layer, the thermometers show minus seven degrees of Celsia.
Car mines are made for example on Proseku, also sealed with Štěrboholská.
The most secure means of transport is the subway.
Tramvaje is running late for example on the line between the Karlovy Square and the Square of Peace.
He's back in the morning to sit down with the Prague crisis staff.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to cancel seven quick connections because of snow.
The problem, for example, has a track from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Travelers should check the current situation.
The airport was closed from Wednesday 11 hours a night to five to the morning.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already running, but only with caution.
In Vyškovsk there are invariable three side roads, in Brno there are snow languages and in Blanensk there is a need to conquer some of the links in the above-mentioned snow chains.
The most affected places were Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdlace - Kučerov as well as Šaratice - Milesovice.
Their stretching will need to be framed by the frescoes.
When they're out of date, it can't be estimated yet.
There is a need for caution in the area of the White Carpathians in Hodonín.
On the roads that are there because of nature's conservation, only an inertic skin, lying up to a five-centime layer of snow, said ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, it occurred between two to ten centimeters of snow, most rained in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In Moravia, about 15 centimeters of snow occurred.
The snowing in the Czech Republic is gradually rising.
American soldiers have a new, smart weapon--
The U.S. Army has set up a new weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and change the game to their benefit.
A new weapon is like a little superstitious cannon.
It's designed by lasers with accuracy of several meters.
Special charge 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, actually acts as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only at impact to the target but at any point in their ballistics course.
So it can be used against an enemy who hides behind some obstacle, behind the wall or in a ditch.
Shora is usually not protected, and when the murderous rain of steel roofs is on it, it can be removed from the fight.
According to Richard Audetta, which participated in the development of XM-25, there is a new rifle of the first weapon for the crotch that uses the technology.
“The soldier in principle treats it by finding the target, sends a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, thereby obtaining a specified intentional point, according to it adjusts the radius and squeezes the tap”
- Let's say you've measured 543 metres -
“When you press the trigger, the gun will be loaded and the gun will blow off at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters,” said Audette.
400 jobs will be transferred
Fujitsu's concert is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the current administrative building to Marienbader-city in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As in the middle of the field, a giant who specializes in computers and their maintenance, moved in July next year 400 men and women his work place from the current administration building at the Marienbader-city in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to spokesperson Fujist, there should be another 100 jobs of the company that are so far divided into the region in due time.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park are more suitable for the working method of employees.
Fujitsu was also only hired in Bad Homburg.
The competent wingman Bernd Wagner said, “We found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure in Frankfurt-Nederrad”
An excellent link to the airport is very important to the global society like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important undertaking within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointments of the losers yesterday.
The head of the economic referendum in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was possible to obtain the “Global Player” -
It is said that it is a fantastic expression of confidence in this site -
Fujitsu said he's going to town, sitting down is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwis (Green), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed in time by the management of the company about its intention.
Of course, we offered our help to the company, said Korwis.
Friends' contacts, but they couldn't change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property on Marienbader-city.
There were decisive economic reasons in the outcome.
It is now a matter of preventing a long non-compliance in such a prominent place.
“I hope the owner and tenant of the cooperative building will be the owner -
The Home of Rathaus-city, which has so far used Fujitsu, and the neighboring ‘Kleine Vertikale’, belonged to other buildings in Marienbader-city for the most disciplined construction purposes of the spa town ten years ago.
The railway station and the town council were established as a joint project of the city and private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticized, however, due to the massive construction of the areas which had previously served as a parking lot and also due to the height of the buildings.
In 2001, an investment consulting company and a Feri rating was moved home, a manufacturer of travel distribution software, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu computer manufacturer, who was then associated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobileien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and after a year were sold by Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
Rýna and Mohanu branch is one of the largest in Germany, the most employees of Fujitsu are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg is moving to Frankfurt-Nederrad subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and TDS companies.
In the administrative building of Astro Park, there were 7,000 square metres for this purpose.
In the complex - his name draws attention to a starboard ground which is 20 years old, but is based in addition to other central links of electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon off server - threats to Assangem
Wikileaks get close.
Amazon’s Internet Service has shut down the platform for detection on its servers.
It is possible that this happened on a political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depressions.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is getting more and more pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, he called for a prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman to fight Wikileaks from other countries and businesses.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol list, is to be held according to one newspaper contribution in the UK.
-Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server -
“Free speech in the country of singles” was communicated by activists to publish short Twitter reports at the centre (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon downloaded Wikileaks' internet documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish a large number of access to documents.
By means of Twitter services, Wikileaks explained this step: ‘Fajn - our dollars are now spent by employing people in Europe -
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, then they should stop selling books.
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's coworkers performed a search, published a CNN television station on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
President of the Senate Committee on Defence at home threatened by Amazon boycott, informed the British-Guardian-
“I wish Amazon had joined this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks,” said the Senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for the platform to be avoided in other countries in the use of servers.
“Wikileaks is acting illegally, in vain and carelessly, and thus our national security is exposed to dangers and threatens life on the whole planet,” said the impartial senator in one statement.
“No responsible company - either American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material -
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, which is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list searched by Interpol.
Based on the report in London's paper, the Independent is held at 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks Kristinn Hofnsson in London said there were threats.
“The challenges of the murder of Julian Assange were complete.
That's why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, said Hryfnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hofnsson apparently responded to the statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor Arkansas asked Mike Huckabee to be responsible for publishing Wikileaks for treason and executed.
In Canada, one adviser to the Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, probably ironically, Assange should be killed - and Obama could use a “target aircraft” -
Meanwhile, she broke up between the White House and Assange's word shootout.
The American spokesperson Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it “the proud and absurd” - that Assange requested the resignation of Minister Hillary Clinton abroad, if he is responsible for recently published spy calls for diplomats.
“I am not quite sure why we are interested in the opinion of one person with websites”, said Gibbs.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website -
The US government is now largely investigating the security of its databases.
The Special Agent was appointed Deputy Director of the Centre for Antiterrorism Measures, Russell Travers, told the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of the necessary reforms in the structure, which are necessary after publication of the report from the Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US Government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger of publishing on Wikileaks.
“We have made everything we can to make contact with them” said the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry Philip Crowley.
“We are ready to protect them, if necessary”
Frozen University
At the “Gelato University”, ice-cream confectioners are preparing for a better year’s time.
The basic course for future ice creamers, which takes three days, is great interest and visitors are coming from around the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from?
Gelatier and Gelatai.
Gelatier, Czech slightly obsolete ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelataio takes ice cream out of a cooling box, puts it in her purse and sells it.
To find out this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the Bologna province.
But who wants to learn even more about ice cream, he will not get out of the “Gelato-University” - Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, a manufacturer of ice-cream machines established an ice cream-cream university to match its machines everywhere with high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is huge interest and visitors are coming from around the world.
But it also offers several days special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in its own ice cream shop.
Someone desires in their Midlife-Crisis after a new career, others are referring to the thin ice of their inconceivable desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves Slow-Food movement, and in future he would like to offer a quality European product in Ice-Cream industrial land.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant, and she would like to start her own after years of stress work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one of Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian woman in Julia's home arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Geletiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also silky silkness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget during her training on a Southern and Italian cherry on cake: “The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a significant dose of romance”
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender, which warms everything in an electronic programme at 85 degrees and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then they turn on the machines with a tap and wipers pasterized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately the cent is covered with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you experiment yourself?
Luciano warns to get carried away by the spirit of the time until the unknown.
Who is talking about ice cream - only from natural ingredients - apparently he also used stabilisers - mostly natural product such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will be able to make its own ice grain.
Some variations in basic matter are allowed.
It's gonna be better with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes with ice cream flavors according to the ingredient to be purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
“Adders will try to force a lot of flavoured ingredients into you -
However, you should simply experiment -
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white basic matter that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for ally chocolate temptation.
It is now permitted to take part in an ice cream course.
Luciano always lets them produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and high quality ice cream - either with eggs or without them in essential matter, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will also be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pyré - given the taste it is not always better.
Sugar ice cream doesn't have to taste more nuts when it contains more leaf nuts.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi will produce a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only after a balanced mixture picks up the right taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numbering task: If peach pyré with a lot of sugar is used, sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
There is a need for extra sugar in lemon ice cream.
Luciano will remove a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the fruiters thus measure grape must).
Lucky for the tables, the numbers make it easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help a device for automatic production of base matter.
There's also a device that's got the finished ice cream mixture at the same time moving into the cream and cools down to minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo is going to get himself dirty and his colleagues from the top to the bottom of his fruity pyré when he gets out of control of a huge blender.
In each course, Maestro Luciano considers it only a matter of time when something like this happens.
Visitors in Double Light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered to be an independent institution for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it,” said the middle of Munich’s chief Testbiotech Christoph Then.
Head of the Efsa Expert Group for Gentechnical Change Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert Efsa have had a contract with Ilsi's lobistite union for several years.
This one is funded by a concerted one like monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in Efs’ control regulations for genetic plants in a decisive way and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
Efsa's prescriptions are said to match in the entire paragraphs with Ilsi's documents and thus bear the industry's manuscript, which should be checked by the Italian authorities.
This is the second time Testbiotech points to conflicts of interest.
Recently, a high manager from Efs has passed without supplements or transitional time to the Swiss Agraar company Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
In addition, the Radio for Central Germany (MDR) recently revealed the EU-wide personnel link between the industrial lobby and the Ministry of the Environment, as well as EU Members.
In the meantime, Efs cannot recognize conflicts of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are highly high-quality, are given in one statement.
From experts working for Efs, it is not required that they do not have contact with industry.
But they have to be delivered.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It itself is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and policy - in addition to an estimate of the risk of biotechnology without lobbyists.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that currently authorised genetically modified plants are in animals without any attempt to feed, and that there is no testing of the reaction of genetic plants on environmental effects.
“We want to know what, for example, the geneticly modified maize will do in the field,” says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which will not produce reliable results.
If they do not look for the risks, how could they be found then, he asks the prosecution of Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
From 1994 onwards, the scientific worker has been studying the genenics and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry as well as in the US are trying to influence and discredit critical scientists in Europe as well.
That is why there are no scientists that are no longer connected to the company.
Most of the studies are not published, which are critical to the companies.
\"The mind controls security research\" is thought of Hilbeck.
Track of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing outside the train station in Stutgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, the swamps arrived and began to push a large piece of northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21 billion reduction in the station.
When the construction stopped, most wings were in trouble.
Disturbed to 6,000, 7000 pieces.
A calcium from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone which was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a statue in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these pieces.
The stones are the relics.
-They're not allowed to disappear.
It is astonished: “The light stone and the poor stone, the simple and the spring -
When one broke up, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the stones from Stutgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former deposit of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man dealing with old stones.
He bought all the people that were created during the storm in Huttgart.
“It would be shameful if they were grounded or disappeared on the deponia,” says in his office, a wooden building that was previously a house watcher.
They say they were calling him and threatening him when in September all the newspapers stood to buy the remains of the northern wing from the company that performed the democracy.
But he's been talking to his opponent S-21 for days.
And he explained to them that he was not allowed to be demolished at all.
And when it's happening, then it's the most understandable thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21-procursions each one about 80 kilograms heavy block, a price per piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope that he will return it in the remodeling construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 big trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest sold out a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came out of every corner and pulled away what went into the trunk and the trailer.
Hundreds of Stuttgart disputed long ago in the ‘zódky’ or as the edges of the floods with herbs.
Actually, this stone is nothing special, says Rongen.
“If there were no political capacitors,” he said.
He's in his field car, and he's going for a ride after his 20-caliber kingdom.
He studied law first, he interrupted the study, later the biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a stone lover.
He's got 40,000 tons of stones stored.
They weigh their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest businessman with old stones in the Republic.
It's freezing.
In the snow there is artistically processed sandstones.
“One of them belonged to the Marien-city in Dresden, he tells.
Sandstone from Labe, yellow, warm, excited.
-My favourite stone -
We're moving on the way up through the woods.
Shows on stock: red sandstone, earlier part of the railway station in Karlsruhe.
And come on.
- Nice travertine -
One day they belonged to those quarks on the Neccardastradion T.O.T.
Everywhere in the snow there are stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from police presidence in Stutgart, red grenade from Sankt Blasien Temple, tuf from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job, what a effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of the way they used to run the stones in hand and transport using simple hammers and bull carriages, it will become totally respectful.
I mean, it would be a scandal if something like this got rough.
He wasn't rich, he wasn't rich any more.
But today, a stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition to that, there were stoners, one statuer, one blacksmith, one glassmaker, and one gardener.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the one who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Kolin at an apparent time.
They're also going to save stones.
Fighting talent about High Potentials
There's a lot of people in the snack room.
16 students are pushing at breads with salmon, tomato soups and sweetness.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Car Manufacturer Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design at the workshop.
Together with the VW developers, they are supposed to talk about the future car - and just by the way, to meet Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to compete in a race with the smartest head, as well as VW, succeed and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, they may first recruit in service of the most gifted graduates before they reach the labour market and be interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of the success of their students, they try to discover exceptional talents in projects that are oriented to practice and to gain them.
At TU Braunschweig trying to win the car company talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department gives away pens, rubber bears and plates with the VW logo.
They tell young people about programs for practice, student jobs, and suggest they go to the concert.
Nico Sele from TU Braunschweig is taking care of the project together with the VW.
They see advantages for both sides: ‘Students get in touch with industry and gain experience’
“VW can also get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who could be a co-worker,”
Such co-ops, according to Sele, are not unusual.
The news is, she's so openly fighting for students.
“Jinak was more of a major professional project,” says Sele.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a long range of candidates.
On the contrary, they have to try and try to lure themselves into a highly qualified workforce.
First of all, the graduates of engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained unsettled in October.
And according to VDI prediction, the so-called lack of engineers will still grow.
The KPMG’s audit and consulting firm is being followed by Roman Dykta for the hunting of talents.
It organizes a demanding Recruiting-events such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants have to find a way by GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the USA next year.
Participants can also look into KPMG branches and meet the company.
Before that, he decides in two selection wheels, who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème will fly to the USA from many interested parties.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities they will pay according to the directives still tougher laws.
“We want to distinguish ourselves with our Race from others”
“The only trip on the sailboat was too little for us, ” he said.
Looks like the Dykt's talent hunter is lucky.
“We stayed in touch with all participants similar events in the last year -
“Some will soon attend the study and plan to attend our work,” he says.
In addition to the direct call on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented in classical terms on labour markets.
- We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions -
“As for example at Intersolar” states Sitha Stübe, head of staff department of the manufacturer of Solarworld solar technology.
Bonn's company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
At present 35 positions are listed on the company's website.
“Now it is very difficult, to put the seats on,”
\"It's a lot of time and money,\" he says.
Another option is to contact the professors at the university.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
“Professors inform us that it is possible to do practice or to write a diploma work in our home”
Solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
“The great company often cannot offer it,” says Stübe’s Head of Personnel.
They haven't played the main role in searching for work for a long time.
Flexible working hours, child care or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld settled in one study at the Great Place to Work 55. place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks coworkers how they are satisfied with their work and the working environment and follow the framework conditions of staff.
The head of Stübe's personal department hopes that her location will bring points to people who are interested in work.
“I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about external assessments of potential employer” - he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer is through his own employees,” he says.
This is called an internal Employer Branding, i.e. the establishment of an employer on the market within its own employees.
-The satisfaction of staff is the best ambassadors -
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make advertising from themselves to their employer among friends and friends.
It's like a game with a string, says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drills
Over the next years, they will not come to the coast of the US-common state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico for new oil drills.
The government in Washington issued an appropriate ban - thereby canceling the final application of earlier plans.
So far, there are no new drillings outside the Atlantic coast.
The Home Secretary Ken Salazar said it Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban that should be paid for at least the next five years is the explosion on the drilling tower -Deepwater Horizon - April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees life and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama has signaled on the pressure of the opposition and industry his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates are trying to reduce the dependence of the US on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is clearly not explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British power company BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigation committee that Obama has entrusted should submit the results during December.
In October, the Home Secretary Ken Salazar cancelled a ban on drilling which he paid off from the explosion.
Following that, they submitted various oil concession applications for new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent such disasters with more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the audit office, which has pointed out many corruption charges, is substantially reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would cancel the archery of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now openly warned that more stringent regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil consumed in the Gulf.
The main plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry, which is the result of the current survey in the field of advice by BDO - before the drilling ban in the center.
American Energy Alliance is still complaining about the uncertainty in the field: ‘Nobody knows exactly what the regulation changes.
Investment in new mining projects is carried out until appeal - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like in the pump: billions of litres of carbonated oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni area in Nigeria.
People feed stealing, corruption, and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
“Don’t worry,” calms the journalist of ecological activist: “Today you will get enough oil mud before the lens.
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched the attempt to photograph a boy who was carrying on a chest of water, surrounded by smothers: this scene works in a water forest with rainbow colors almost nice.
The fact that brown oil clots are floating under the surface is not seen.
She used to collect enough garnel into the container, tells Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetta River.
In the meantime, the water became very dead.
Five years ago, it went into a huge bottle of oil from a broken lead.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must fall for at least six hours to get into waters where fish are: the Ogoni area, which is located in the heart of the Delta of the Niger River, belongs to one of the most infected areas in the world.
On the way along the river mangrave swamps with lots of side currents, the whole range of the trigger is still known.
The boat engine cooks instead of light water with brown porridge and who sinks his hand into the water stretches oil fingers.
Manger roots are turning out of the country like black sticks of a pharmacy, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We find the flocks of birds that are commonly found in wet areas: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it will be in an earlier paradise, where it smells like in the pump, scary silence.
“What is happening here is an environmental direction of war,” says Celestine Akpobari: “We live in constant fear of health.
Comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battle field, where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe were recorded here, here in the 1980s, the first resistance with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, had to stop his production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the whole area of the Delta of three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 mining drills and 7000 kilometres of lead more than two million barrels of black gold lies a oil field in the area of Ogoni Lady, for the company the situation is too unstable.
Each few hundred meters are bars made of water steel constructions such as bizarre statues: ‘A Christmas tree’, so too softly called the heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them are rusty.
Every minute, such head breaks down, tells Akpobari, and then flows a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion liters in the Delta have flown into the ecosystem for 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that went off to the sea at Alaska during the Supertanker crash -Exxon Valdez - 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes which continue to suffer ecological calamity responsible.
While Shell company refers to sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectionists are talking about the cracking heads of drilling and inadvertent leadership as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than it is used in the world, said the US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only a number of failures on the lines are, in general, higher than elsewhere.
In a place that looks from a distance like abandoned oil covered under the wide sky, it comes out of the mangers of characters: they are completely naked and in the neck of oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly associated with the leadership, partly loosely scattered on the ground, burning fire: illegal small refineries.
The ropa is warmed up in the barrel over the fire for hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, from the direction to the capture pot of gasoline, then the drop at the end of the kerosin line and finally the oil.
In this way he makes Michael and his four coworkers a day up to four barrels of 300 liters: “We make about $44,000 ($22).
Delta residents use chronic fuel shortages in black Africa's largest oil state.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
Mixedly low EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be exceeded by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from the “bunkers” that are connected to lead everywhere in the Ogon region: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost in the entire region of the Niger Delta.
But only a negligiblely small part of the stored raw material is illegally depleted: the largest share will be filled with organised criminal networks to which politicians and high-level military representatives, to tankers and to sell it to the world market.
The debate whether they caused a disaster to the residents and their intervention or a lax method of production is considered to be an activist of Akpobari as purely academic.
‘If oil companies were not regarded as invaders, and if they did not destroy the life of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries.
In the meantime, however, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the departure of the company is taken into account: ‘Some other nations such as the Chinese are shown to be better,
Michael's gonna be fine.
“The best time for you to disappear” says the muscle manufacturer.
- Every moment the soldiers can come -
If they were found by a special military unit, they wouldn't be in prison, but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from the raw material.
“This cursed thing has been given our country in all respects to the bottom,” says Akpobari.
The investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in engines A380
A380 obviously has a major safety failure.
The investigators found in the search of the machine, which emergencyly landed, possible building error that could lead to a ‘catastrophic engine failure’
The Qantas Air Force wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
When travelling to Qantas was in an emergency landing early November, probably more luck than has been known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major safety failure in its investigations on some A380 machines - and now it warns against possible building error.
Perhaps the defect would have severe consequences: on one oil connection, cracks could arise due to wear, this Thursday was announced by the Authority’s ATSB.
This could lead to a ‘catastrophic engine failure’
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is also the Qantas airbus, which had to take an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine producers.
She had the reasons for the appeal in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows further legal action against this company.
The head of Qantas Alan Joyce said that his company would demand compensation for an incident in early November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released, and they damaged the surface.
Rolls-Royce called it the cause of the burning oil.
After this event, there must be a change of up to 40 engines worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further security tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines in question.
Security recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB Martin Dolan.
Security deficiencies were considered to be of sufficient importance to make sure that all of them were informed.
After the emergency landing of Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of her eleven A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one of the A380 engines as security measures.
Two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowing creates chaos in transport
Germany snowed almost all night in white: almost all over the country.
There are chaos in many roads, train connections, and letads are cancelled.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter cold Germany: almost the entire Republic fell on Thursday at freezing snow temperatures - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several highways and many roads there is a very limited right.
On the A7 at Flensburg, road service was still in deployment, but did not manage the newly loaded snow.
There was still a strong impact wind above the Baltic Sea.
The Baltic Sea coast in Sleswig-Holštynsk is expected by a turbulent flooding in the morning with a water state of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow curtains caused significant problems in Sask on motorways and state roads.
According to the bad weather centres Meteomedia was therefore in the Saudi Switzerland the level of the alarm on purple - at all the highest degree.
Part of there occurred 30 centimeters of a new snow, strong and fresh winds caused curtains.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left in the night.
In Sask-Anhaltsk, police authorities reported great road problems.
On A2 caused the wind and snow of slow operation and traffic.
There were troubles in Durinsk because of snow on A4 and A9.
According to Germany, there is a great deal of trouble in Sask, Sask-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and Northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, pierced trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and bends.
There must have been a remote operation from Leipzig to Nuremberg in Saxony.
In Dublin Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received a train from firemen and rescuers of wool blankets, food and drink.
Snow wind was over the road.
Many years have been cancelled in large German airports because of snow winds.
According to the spokesperson, information about years have already been reported from Munich's late years.
In Frankfurt, namhan has been canceled for 40 years by spokesperson Fraport.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
There are few passengers left at the airport without connection, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in East Holštínsk.
The engineer was easily injured.
Due to the snowed road, there was a similar accident near Nuremberg: there was also an capture of trucks on the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers injured - the Bayreuthu route to Nureumberka remained closed until the morning hours.
And then one 30-year-old woman died after Aschafferfenburg and her car turned to a glider road.
But the meteorologists have good news: snow stays in the form of a light request, and therefore it will be lifted even in light winds.
But the wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will the rapid winds of the strength of the wind.
But it's going to be great winter - locally minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buy-in for the Tower Doubles
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one news contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the capital seat in Frankfurt.
The inability could take up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters of the company: Towers-doublers in the Franciscan bank district have upgraded; in the meantime, bankers have been switching to their old jobs again.
Now, however, he seems to want the financial company to renovate again - and he is looking for buyers for both marbles, as he informs -Financial Times Deutschland - with appealing to the speaker.
The spokesperson didn't name the reasons for the planned sale.
“We are constantly examining whether it is more meaningful to own or sell property and then rent again,” he said.
This is the largest credit institution in Germany again after a short period of time giving up its corporate headquarters.
The bank only took over the doubles in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from its own funds investors and then significantly renewed them.
Energy reconstruction has swallowed around EUR 200 million according to data.
Selling would probably bring a bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper text, experts estimate the value of the registered towers to “Greentovers” at the price of around EUR 500 million.
The spokesperson said that it is not decided whether the building will be sold again to the property of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of poisons for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memory of the miners in New Zealand who have been declared dead after several explosions down there.
Still hasn't been able to free the dead, because security situation is still complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 have been incinerated downstairs.
The shafts, where the disaster occurred, were the trigger probe, did not show any sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not proceed due to safety.
Second, the authorities and experts of the fact that the miners no longer have any chance of survival.
Still failed to free the dead.
Now they honor the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand for sunny weather.
They've been quiet for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, lamps and names of miners were built to honor the monuments of the miners.
Also pictures and personal things like clothes and surf board found their place here.
The government's buildings have been framed by flag to half-yards.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out of the country again - on the surface, said Minister John Key to the participants.
But they never came home.
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was caught down there.
A number of foreign diplomats were involved besides the Ministerial President and related victims.
During the 19th November the British and South African miners were also caught.
The rescuers began to fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as poison gases are dissolved, it begins to cool down high temperatures inside the mine, told the journalists of the police president Gary Knowles.
Hell, warriors!
Is the horror of an artistic cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to re-establish the old border with its battle epos -Wallalla Rising -
On what audience he was thinking of the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when he was doing the \"Walhalla Rising\"
The captured Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will free himself from his martyrs and kill largely with the supernatural force of his opponents - it sounds ideally for young men's viewers who are looking for a bloody event, because our hero helps with cruel killing methods and his enemies even rusts inside their belly alive when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, as it is actually called, he will not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters will pass on one or two sentences at most, or they will be able to move to the permissive dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and moving in a terriblely beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a sphere of the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult enthusiast cinemas with interest in existentialism and very quiet footage of the camera.
It's good to have a movie with more target groups, it's only a shame when they rule out each other.
The director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers - Pusher, is considered to be the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantina, has constantly prevented himself from bringing its works closer to either more humor of the main stream or less brutality of an artistic audience.
Most artists of the art cinema seem to be reborn everywhere by spraying brains and interiors.
The beneficiaries of action films shall be bored at the latest at the moment when one of them appears freely explained with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will remain hanging forever in faith and fog, before the manship seems to be added to America and remain silent there.
So there is nothing to wonder that in Germany - Walhalla Rising - did not get to the cinema and now was released only on DVD.
It's a pity mainly because of the beautiful footage, but also because it's behind a personal fascist, places to a broken blood, it hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
This film is not about dialogues or accurate events, everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that has become a film.
And it's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn will not give him a moment of release and slowly strangle him with his frozen shots and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, but especially unscriptural hatred, which is said to be from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps one another is left to something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all the most unique hero whose motives will never be explained, which will become time for enemies and temporary allies from hell, perhaps by the messenger of the Devil.
It's creating destruction, but maybe it's only for the spoiled ones.
“Wallalla Rising” is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Estimated ground work
The Authority for Nuclear Energy has new warnings on the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, countries are prevented from expressing themselves - and will not allow controls.
Around midnight, from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli combat planes F-15 and a mysterious square building in Syria attack.
It stands on the shore of Euphrat; the nearest city is 30 kilometres away and its name is Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Office (IAEA), her name appears when it comes to a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns from the current.
On the basis of a communication from the US-American foreign intelligence service, the CIA would be a reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village el-Kibar, would well throw on the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
There's nothing else wrong with the technology from the '50s.
The CIA has presented a video with unmanned satellite images.
By means of computer animation, it explained where components of the reactor could have been destroyed, it is intended to be a reduced copy of the North Korean nuclear model Yongbyon.
In addition, photographs were still submitted that showed the building close or even from the inside.
The Reactor was said shortly before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, they don't know much more than that, even the puzzles have increased by time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memory that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building up in the el-Kibar reactor, but essentially did not have evidence that the country had a “active nuclear weapon program” in the country.
Some intelligence services in Europe are even more careful, and they speak only of a resonative reactor, even though the CIA's presentation considers it to be a good thing.
They lack clear evidence, just like IAEA.
On the question of how certain it is that it has a reactor ahead of itself, he answered the UN high diplomat in the summer, and IAEA has some materials available to ask questions -
Although the sum of the unused military buildings was quickly decomposed, they also properly compared the terrain.
Yet, in June 2008, IAEA team was managed by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar by a trace of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, IAEA received satellite photos of commercial dealers from a Member State just after the attack, which should be higher than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these are not on the market because they are exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program and has not even built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israel's weapons, said Damascus.
But that's what IAEA pulled out after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss things - as has been satellite footage.
In addition, he forbidden the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silently silent.
\"We will never comment on this,\" said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently.
The investigation of this case takes place as of June 2008 and is increasing to a serious problem due to the credibility of the Authority, as the High Western diplomat in the seat of the IAA in Vienna, but this is a serious violation of the nuclear ban IEA is being supervised.
IAEA considers it a key to progress in the case of another three equipment to be, in a functional connection, with an alleged reactor - and unlike it, still exists.
The revisions have not yet been conducted, nor have the equipment to which they are or what they have a function or why they are suspicious.
According to the news Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iscandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex on satellite images of a building that is probably one of the suspect objects.
It is probably located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason it refuses Syria's access to these three places.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of so-called fishing expedition - that IAEA would be sent forward to search the military base.
The Jader detectives were alerted to the U.S. secret service facility.
IAEA has the background and satellite images that between these three places and the squares at Euphrat transported material here and there.
In Vienna, he said high Western diplomat that at least one of these should be managed in connection with the production of fuel.
However, there are no evidence of sensitivable activities - i.e. about enriching uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by a uranium that is not enriched.
But where that uranium comes from and where it should be released later on, the plutonium on the bomb, these central questions are likely to be estimated.
It is also unknown whether concerns that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
It's like they've disappeared from the surface of the Earth's hundreds of cargo cars, no one seems to have information about where that bitch got to.
Only a few kilometres from the el-Kibar remote and on the other hand Euphrat lying salt mine al-Tibni, which left Syria to check in 1998 as an appropriate storage for radioactive waste, IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former Inspector IAEA Robert Kelley put him in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But images from space show that after IAA requested access, Syria performed at all suspicious places of groundwork and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it did not help to clarify suspicions.
In addition, they speak diplomatic circles about the fact that IAEA spent many months creating a revision plan that would allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only this effort shows how great the interest of the revisions is.
In the meantime, Damašek refused this proposal.
If, a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna were satisfied that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why it does not burn, the United States Ambassador Glyn Davies has been speaking for several months about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest resources that the Vienna nuclear office has to enforce controls.
Chief of IAEA Yukiy Amano, who had to propose inspection, even though he had already talked about the possibility to which I would lie in the future - yet he hesitated.
This option is taking a huge risk: On one hand, most of the IEA Governorial Council is required and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: ‘What happens when they find nothing’
Love at the time of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on a still nameless real estate in the summer, there have been trouble.
She wrote a script herself, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
There's much more he doesn't know yet - but that also causes rest.
It is persistent that the woman who is Muslim falls in love during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosen's women's associations immediately protested, so they moved the planned film from Sarajev to Hungary quickly.
Meanwhile, in Hungary, the film has finished and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosensk.
Bakira Hasec from the Organisation of Women's War victims wrote through the UN-organization to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, now informed the Bosen newspaper - Jolie is also the ambassador UN-organization to help refugees.
She's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a week ago to meet in Hungary, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where they were raped, the love stories did not happen and the attitude of Jolie towards the sacrifice reveals a lot about the script.
Its organisation therefore recommended the UN-organisation to assist refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador, informs Guardian.
What scene did Jolie write?
The Bosen Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, allowed the smaller tahanices in Saraev to film - is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come yet.
The young author points out that in his film there is no political intention that she has devoted to the conflict in Yugoslavia with great effort to show the terrible consequences of the war and to all interested parties to give space.
In view of the content, it remains indeterminate.
On the internet there is another version of the film that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the beginning of the war and again met when she is like a Bosen Muslim, put into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds rather different than “the time of rape is falling in love with his torturer, ”
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is a pressure on it that is not fair and is based on incorrect information.
Now they can release it already from Hollywood: By publishing illegally on the Internet her script, as they have done so many times.
Nothing but gone
It's good again this evening for Ira.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates too much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans are happy to hear loud music, ass legs.
Bailey-Pub in the Southair Cork version because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit.
“Piva pong” is called a bizarre theatre, and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and to make it a flight to Las Vegas at the World Cup in a beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this crystal beer game and a sustainable computer, that doesn't work together very well.
Yet a 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, to react from the distressy questions that will bring the future.
His plan is not playing passion in Las Vegas, he's in January for an interview in New Zealand.
- I feel so weird about it - he says.
- It's so far away and I don't have a job yet -
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - she has gained her dream job as Eventmanger, perhaps it is a good sign - says a young man and smiles.
Because of their bad prospects at home, they've tried their luck abroad for two of the three Tanner siblings.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
The boys are leaving, just like Tanner's, it looks like a lot of families on the island.
10,000 Ira will leave the country in an in-depth period, and the experts of the scientific institution for the economy and social affairs of the ESCI in Dublin are to be advised.
They even count by 2015 with 200,000 migrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar discharge wave that Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise, which brought to Irros great prosperity, once again expands unhappiness.
In particular, the economic crisis offers young, educated Ira, who have experienced only the rise.
Loss of employment and social retreat seemed to be absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was too much.
In the meantime, there are three of ten women and men up to thirty years without work.
In the Irish Times there are many letters of readers complaining: “In Ireland, everything is coming from a hill.
“It would be possible to rise up against politicians and bankers - who can, but can, go away and lose our country the entire generation.”
“Let the last one turn out, please”
The Leanne Caulfield law student, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future blackly, because the government says it's only cheating and young people don't offer any views to the future.

Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the topic positive.
McLarnon organizes the WorkingAbroadExpo - exhibition that offers overall service on the subject of work abroad.
“For starters in the labour market, work abroad is an excellent chance, though, how to make the first steps on the career ladder” says the manager.
There are pictures of surfers in Australia and skiers on the snowboard in Canada on his website.
The report is clear: working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build somewhere else, Seán O'Donovan has known for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house at Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan gets rarely home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home a loan to the house.
“The situation is sometimes a bit crazy,” he says, when the first time after a long time the threshold of his own home is over.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am essentially not at all -
He laughs at the despair and goes through cold rooms.
Small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, in entrances there are big expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought a house together with his sister four years ago for €380,000 - 100% funded by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions,” she says.
He's afraid it wouldn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan is thinking for a while, and he says: \"I have no children that I would have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over again.\"
A construction engineer doesn't like to talk about what he hears so often.
“No one has to starve - our situation is not even as dramatic as it used to be on this island,” he says.
“For a while to work abroad, that is not the worst that can happen - perhaps then we will just feel like the Irish -
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England for the last economic crisis.
“After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply“
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
To keep an open future and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is another thing that is very concerned about him these days: his 27th birthday party on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she could go crazy for a bachelor party.
“No emotion,” he says, and he drinks himself with a good beer.
- Good-bye, that sounds disturbing.
\"Let's call it a party of departure, quite simply, with some friends, several drinks, several games --
Common practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing as well as support for private business.
Criminal activity raises greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more powerful than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobarómto, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been regularly held since 1995, it can therefore monitor changes in positions across the whole area.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, dominates two related things.
The first is that Latin America has quite a happy mood.
The second is the increase in stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries at the edge of Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, with the average growth of 6% per year since 2002, democracy support increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most human areas, are democratic beliefs, which withdraws the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in their country in practice, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it was a large increase (graf 3).
About 34% said that they trust the snow in their country and 45% trust the government, it is the same figures as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, she undermined democracy in Latin America's economic crisis.
The aid was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, a stronger social security network helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin American people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% in this year.)
However, the charge is turned into a wide spectrum from country to country (see Chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its president Luize Inácia Luly da Silva is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where recession has been more serious and has worsened the state of violent crime.
Only the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America are seen as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
A total of 31% says that they either became victims of crime last year or close relatives, but this is a decrease compared to 38% last year's data and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Massier economic performance reflects the growing support for private business and market economy: about 71% of respondents across the area say that private business is essential for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a leading country in the area, as stated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States are considered to be the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and in a large part of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and the Netherlands.
Criteriond Options
No one expected a general election in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country get scared.
The elections meant full-blown and repeated voting, voting tickets broken down by channels, broken electoral rooms and intimidation.
Volunteer room opened after hours late.
Many Haitians, including many displaced because of the January earthquake, were roaming around trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several supposed predecessors, shouted it was fraud and called after the election was cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent characters, spread across the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a highly built UN official in Haiti, stated that there were quite good choices in many respects.
The observers of the American Organization and the Caribbean community have carefully said that they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process.
In other words, the show continues.
The elective authority whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, a non-popular withdrawal of the President and his candidate Jude Célestin, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive fight is scheduled for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Miranda Manigat, the former first lady, have resigned from their initial challenge to make the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has a small or negligible support between voters, will be designated by the election committee for reaching a decisive fight.
Because of an epidemic of the devil and more than 1 million people who still live in states after earthquakes, there were concerns that the election would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganisation they were prevented from doing so.
A total of 250 000 ID cards, which are necessary for the vote, have remained unseated shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
The donors see the choice of legitimate and popular governments as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
So it is clear that the Haitians are on their own.
After point to center
In the weeks when, suddenly, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity strengthened from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in elections next year may depend on whether Mrs Fernández's intimidation of his late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner will give up.
And at these signs, everything will be based on.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy, even after his wife successfully became president, had in the way of drawing up budgets that valued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first pair to spend more income on the amount of quantity.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most of her last year in Congress.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized in the death of Mr. Kirchner for a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of Peronist's ruling political movement joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (which took place in slapping and accusing the government of corruption), Congress could not approve the 2011 budget.
\"I'm not going to come over,\" said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to the next year, while the President will have more space to spend on whether he wants it.
The economy is overheating overheating: this year is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the figures that are close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina sued economic collapses, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleansed INDEC, the statistical agency that joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now die of this policy?
She called for a meeting between private companies and trade leaders.
And her officials say they want to reduce wages to 18% next year.
The economy was encouraged by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández tells you that he wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with bond holders who had previously rejected the restructuring of the debt which Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Madam President Fernández is facing an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudu, the Minister of Economics announced that the Fund would provide technical assistance, in order to propose a new national consumer price index, which would remind the opening to clean INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of his term of office when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of a middle class that is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of return of the Argentines from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will be added.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to break down the many views her husband held in politics.
Half encouragement to China
Taiwan's voters are closer to closer contact with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the legitimate, voted on 27 November for mayors and councils in five urban districts, which may be considered to be a wider evaluation by President Ma Ying-Jou.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail and have a strong commitment in business relations, including the agreement on partially free trade, in the greatest comparison with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma went through the test, but only close.
Although his side of Kuomintang (KMT) ended the defeat of three of the five mayors' offices, she could not win most of the votes.
In addition to this democratic progressive party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to have a greater independence of Taiwan, gained almost 50% of all votes against the 45% of the KMT Party.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the proportion of the votes of his party decreased by around 8%.
For the first time, DPP was a party together with KMT in city councils.
The elections were held as most of the Taiwan elections, which included loud electoral trucks and mass meetings with flags with cast girls.
Part of it was even a mandatory mystery attempt to attentate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary President of KMT, was an appeal for KMT candidates in the election yesterday.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, hurt him and killed the viewer.
It was strictly not intended for the gunman to hurt Mr. Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, DPP leader, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspect falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps China was the only big winner of the campaign.
It was remarkable how it remained behind the question of the mainland itself.
Instead, candidates have agreed on plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT is therefore tended to avoid ties to the Beijing Government.
But this time, DPP also dropped anti-Kinian attitudes.
It is a reaction to the reality and to realise that China's trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma for his part confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
From the Beijing Government, it can be expected that it will continue to continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending the negotiator to Taipej to set up a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
I'm sure he'd also like to see political integration, but after all.
It would be better to wait after the 2012 presidential elections.
In any case, the DPP site has appeared itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on the basis of a corruption charge.
President in 2000-2008 was a storm and advocated a clear independence.
But under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is dying and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was called as a candidate for the president of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party now does everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations may take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a reliable alternative - to Mr Ma's reliable approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In his statement, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would have succeeded better if they insisted on Taiwan being a single country.
He even ordered Mr Su to not run as president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's ratings were bad, despite the overexcessive pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its disbelief seems especially to be based on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
The KMT spokesperson says he's reorganizing his cabin as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan's commitment to friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, a point from which there is no return that has already been completed -
Grammy Nomination: Jazz singer Esceranza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
The statement at the request of the President and people must notice the law.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer President Obama chose to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is referred to as one of Grammy's surprise awards in this year with nominations in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album was released - Esperanza, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with Grammy rules, when an artist must not release more than three albums before it is established by the public identity of the artist,
Its ambitious album from 2010-Chamber Music Society was certainly a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style, and the nimble hands with the elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that Norah Jones has recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent to the voter in Grammy who are looking for a similar jazz work in this category for the last years.
Other jury Grammy rightly appreciates the album Vijay Iyer Trio-Historicity - in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing alba ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of an experienced saxophoneist James Moody-Moody 4B - and keyboardist John Beasley - Positootly -
Trombone Shorty, a chrable favorite from New Orleans, and a frequent guest on HBO-Treme, was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the halls of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorbe.
The Wild Group of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society has gained several merits in the category of large files in which the Childs Ensemble chamber jazz stood in competition and still courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with octetem-Pathways, created a beautiful example of how the bassist could have free hand as a bandist.
Nomination Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classic music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53th annual prices.
The leader of the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his “Deus Ex Machina” for piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album-Dreamhouse - eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
Among the nominees in South California appeared the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his symphony No. 4-Los Angeles, a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer located in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for the manufacturer of classical music of the year has five nominations, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was won by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his “Deus Ex Machina”, and “Metropolis Symphony” from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his“Dreamhouse” from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals;“Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati; and Verdi’Requiem, from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.

Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonena.
About 30 minutes' work is called ‘Los Angeles’, and is dedicated to the former oil magnate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is trapped in Russia.
Dorman a -Mandolin Concerto - was nominated for an instrumental performance soloist with orchestra.
The composer of L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specially for the Mandolín interpreter Avital, who performed at the concert with Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.

In the category of transition the classics obtained the nomination of sopranoist Jesse Norman for their recording - Roots - My Life, My Song -
The planned furniture in Temecule shall be approved by the planning committee
The planned Mosque in Temecule has received unanimous support from the local planning commission for more than five hours often a passionate public witness.
The critics attacked the project to promote terrorism and lead to suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in line with local laws and will be extremely impressive.
“A lot of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, who you will remember,” said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
\"I am very proud of it as an American citizen.\"
“It means justice will always win,” he says.
“The opposition is minimal,” he added.
“Those who are opposed only loudly shout“
- We have really good people in our valley -
The meeting began at 6 o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time discussed with people who were for or against the centre. These voices were evenly divided, he gives Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the news website.
“There is no America,” said one comment.
“We are the Planet of the Epic with Socha freedom.”
- America has fallen -
In other parts of the country, the Islamic Centre planned to raise protests, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, a tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families had been living in Riverside County for years without an incident, but wanted a larger and more suitable space than the warehouse space that he rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
The new furniture with dimensions of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and will grow up to 43 feet high.
She should take a place of 4,32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
The sponsors can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to the arena increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of strange bacteria that can use peanuts as one of its nutrients extends space to search for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps even further.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth, claiming that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and basic.
“This organism has a dual capacity,” he says.
“It can grow either thanks to phosphorus or aprinciple -
“This fact is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of a truly \"mosmian\" life,” commented this fact Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of reports which appeared on Thursday on the online issue of Science magazine.
Long was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake California are able to continue to grow after the iron is replaced by phosphorus.
“You will start to wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of news.
This finding is important to find life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, produced extensive speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider to be 'standard' may not be necessary for life so absolutely,\" explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
“This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure,” added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felix Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobological Institute at NASA, which led the study focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of iron.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically similar elements, so it considered that the microb that is exposed to both elements can be able to replace one another.
“Aron is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to phosphorus,
‘The result is that organisms can very difficult to separate these elements from each other,
“The iron is so different that it does not work as well as phosphorus. When it gets into the organism, it starts working in the biochemical processes,” explained Anbar.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exhibit them increasing concentrations of the iron that bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes are growing better in phosphorus, but given that they can also survive with a replacement of peanuts, the possibility is that the form of life that uses peanuts can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or months where iron is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a specialist microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of an iron that could be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example in which this fact could be achieved.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists were speculating that they might have used him earlier in life.
“This indicates that there could be other ways to create life, not just the way it was created during the early Earth period,” said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simona research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four dog shows that someone stole from Bellflower Motel were found. He informed the sheriff of the Los Angeles area on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two akits and the Welsh Pembroke Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower Motel 6, they informed the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered in the middle of the afternoon and left two dogs then in the middle of late evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the police department for the Los Angeles area.
“The good news is the dogs are fine,” said Whitmore.
They're in good shape.
‘They were transferred to their rightful owners’
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found in what location he did not share detailed information about finding them.
The investigation continues:
“We don’t want to talk about it,” said Whitmore.
-We follow the rules -
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not found to comment on the case.
They were very happy when at the Wednesday afternoon their two akits were found in a shelter in Downey.
The Sheriffs found van and two dogs separated from Compton.
Trace Akity, three-year-old Trace dog and 10 months old female Didi, were unharmed, informed the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breed, who were planning to participate in this week's regional competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unfounded until their discovery late in the center.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are this weekend in town to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they plan to show Trace.
The other dogs were supposed to compete in other competitions, scheduled in days before the show AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek Journal The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only once a stop at almost monthly steam travel after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered to the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a puppy boxer, Parson Russell Terrier and a British fire - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They've opened up the windows a little bit to have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dog. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether prices would be awarded.
The lion is ready to scream again when the restructuring of the MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green to start over.
The federal insolvency judge of New York on Thursday officially blessed, before the packaged, with a plan of creditors to make up about $5 billion of debt and clean up the way for 86 years of entertainment, which focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
The fourth result is that the plan meets the U.S. Convention Order requirements does not remain any legal obstacles to reinventing the founder of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the research.
The number of employees decreases to approximately 320 of the original over 400.
MGM is not built suddenly from Chapter 11, until the JPMorgan Chase does not match the planned financial resources that allow a loan of 500 million dollars to finance new MGM operations and production.
It's now a connection with an investment bank that needs $75 million alone and funding is expected around the end of December.
The restructuring process started in May 2009, when the Moelis & Co investment bank was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management fought to afford an interest rate of 300 million a year.
On August, Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former general manager of Enron and a turnover expert, known for Krispy Kreme Dougnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and 140 R & D creditors took much longer than expected.
Following several months, the parties agreed that they would give companies for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several candidates, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion of US dollars plus the funds that the creditors requested.
In spring this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began to work on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal failure, the plan was finally approved by the creditors by the end of October.
When MGM is officially up in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive many million dollar bonuses for their work.
The Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of 9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which infect for their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called \"success fee\" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to restore production in MGM, which only released one film this year and put together a design for seven or eight films that will be released from the beginning of 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the financing of two films, which will be the book-Hobit, together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share in these two films, directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, owned by approximately 18% of MGM's debts, sought to combine studies with Lions Gate Entertainment with the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your budget up balance
The leader of this year is the most amazing toy of iPad, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention to the budget for gifts.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and one Kinec game costs just as much as 10 coral drawers or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toys dealer - Wal-Mart, Toys -R - Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to recent years.
While relatively fewer new toys appeared with associated websites, two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, it offers more.
The number of buttons with buttons batteries is increased, as well as batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All these prices are from Toys-R-Us, except for cases otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, since 3 years) are stuffed animals who sing when you press their belly.
At one press, it gives the animal tone and the other press starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: As soon as you're starting to work, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, since 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed 14 inches of animation doll at Elmo Live Technology, which can play the game Simon Says and can also take a month's walk thanks to his innovative bloc with bicycle blocking.
Children are testing Mickey's dance instructor, although their parents complain about lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn the car into fun with self-righteous, amusing work.
If you look after the smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have such effective teaching as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first significant change in the Leapfrog series, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot to the SD card that allows to display family photos.
And in the end, Scrabble Flash (30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a file of five cubes that are not larger than a box from a match, each has an LED display.
The goal is to create the words by placing the cubes in a series before the time runs out; it is great for competitions in improvised composition of words.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkinz toys and Club Penguin were represented to the highest extent in the toys.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin - Mix 'N Match Figue Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will receive enough credit at Club Penguin stores on any two items.
This could include, like, wheel skates or Puffle animal.
A little bigger than your dentist's brush is Hexbug Nano (10, for children from five years old), the latest of a series of microbitters on the know-how battery.
The box moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun to make a maze out of the cube and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very durable.
Ours was able to fall down with the kitchen table and spend even some time in the background of our dog.
The introduction of softer police controls in China
As a city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlled his orders and issued orders in half-end with military authority.
He wanted women's members - Chinese state-of-the-art urban order enforcers, surrounded by and discarded for their hard cover and adversity in violence - have led to some impression of the crowds around them.
- Stand straight -
- Help yourself -
Show them, whispers silently, “what nice girls look like”
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood up.
Four pair of black shoes are sorted as a ruler.
Four head covers perfectly sit on hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
“I personally think they look average,” said Mr. Tang.
-Models are nice -
More than one government tried to restore the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new goalkeepers to have higher education.
The Guangdong province has changed grey-green uniforms to allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China replaced his strong-armed views: in 2009 it was stated that in one report 50 officers were surrounded by an inseparable carriage with snacks and had carefully looked at the owner after half an hour of the seller packed and left.
Xindu, a city district with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, have chosen the operation as the main image.
Since 2003, the period has been completed by its municipal police by 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The goal is to show the police in addition to the gross side of the police also the softer, the woman's side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson alone would have been in trouble to get into secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue criticism for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce the city decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media generally captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei's province were walking an undisputed viewer to death after he used his phone to film, as they began in the procedure in the case of protest against the dump.
Last year, police training in Beijing took place, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, the manual was a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators with no blood stamp.
This year, a sublime melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injury to the left part of his brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet shows Chinese police how they attack street dealers.
“Chengguan scared the government,” China Daily, national edition, said last year after further discussions on tactics.
In fact, there was a thorough clean-up on the paper.
Skeptics say that this is not enough access.
After the period in October he was interested in eight new female police officers, the founder of The Beijing Evening News addressed whether women had real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be both.
The period required female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age with a good figure and - again features of the face in the right proportion -
Adeptics should have a height higher than the average - i.e. higher than 1.6 metres.
The service at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The shareholders claim that work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years.
“His image is an important thing,” said one of the most named police on Rednet.com, as if of government websites.
“The candidates must first demonstrate the external quality that they then determine are heights, weights, facial features, etc.
Then it comes to a number of nature and “inward quality”
Women are like flowers' vases, said and added, “Although they will be vases, they will also have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City, disagrees with this description.
But he said that the higher requirements are common in China also for other positions of work, both sexes.
Just like the requirement to measure the facial features.
Which means that the question of good judgment between the Chinese is discussed.
I'm sure you don't get sick or freeze.
“It cannot allow a lame or proud man to serve with us,” said Mr. Zheng.
- His image wouldn't be good -
Liu Yi, who holds watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, face like apple and finely shaped mouth.
He doesn't think that the emphasis on her appearance might have a sex scene, she said.
“You think I look sexy in this uniform,” she asked with an ironic look.
Her coworker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says: “Our task is to represent the image of the city,
They do not object to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely to start traders in the alley where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers who run foot or bikes and try to sell as many cans as possible and a bowl of tofu before they are thrown out.
- Mr. Wang, you have to leave -
“We have already told you so many times” said Miss Xu when he started running the marketplace, and he left his bike with noodles for a while.
The police describe their duties as more monotonous than they are.
“Every day is basically the same thing,” said Huag Jing, 20, who studied in his choice of marketing.
- Large routines -
One reason for this is that women's policemen have no powers as their male counterparts to entertain the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leader.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public expressions of hostility against official aparate, which are common within the whole of China.
This year hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after the false rumors of the police killing the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the nighttime; 14 government vehicles were turned over or burned.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Only two blocks from Baoguang's quiet square, where the police guarded the morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
The police took care of a motorcycle that was fixed on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could've cried as he wanted.
15 minutes' distance from the police, the rage, the elbows against the cars, and quickly away with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator attached to the male group, remained in the back, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female policemen, coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in maintenance and cooling the image.
- We sometimes fight verbally -
“We sometimes fight physically,” Mr Li said.
“It is most of all a public that will begin with it.
The prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign.
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges concerning his affair with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced at the center of the senator's attorney.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat which Mr Ensign, the New York Republican, faced and which he was, until the scandal, considered to be a possible Republican candidate for the president for 2012.
Mr Ensign's office said that he was a decision that followed almost after an annual investigation, - certainly pleased -
The Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate's ethical committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the object of the investigation and that there was no further accusation against him on this matter.
The Ministry of Justice refused to express the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in New York Times said that Mr Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to provide a lucier lobby that led to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, of the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier at Ensign's campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton has employed so many documents and interviews for them.
Since Hampton was recently Mr Ensign's assistant, he was excluded from the lobbying law of his former employer or Senate for a year.
Experts on ethics claim that the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were before an affair with friends, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
The evidence that has been published has revealed that this is a clear case of preparation for infringement,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer, who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator Ensign, Mr Brand, and other legal officers with the ethical specialization, they said that the Ministry was cautious about political actions, after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to put an action against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of a violation of state attorney.
Federal prosecutors, clearly hiding weapons, said Melanie Sloan, CEO of the Civil Society for Responsibility and ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group who filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in this case.
“This essentially shows that laws do not apply to highly constructed government officials,” she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr Ensign, told him that on Monday he had called the D.A. of the Ministry of Justice and then the other day, and told him that the Ministry had not found any charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defence team cooperates with the applicants in trying to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated on Wednesday's statement, negotiated in accordance with the law.
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments that Mr. Coggins gave him.
“I do not feel comfortable telling the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal electoral Commission decided to suspend the investigation by a separate complaint in which the ethical group accuses that the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents amounted to $96.000 broke the federal election law.
The Election Commission said that there was not enough evidence to prove that money had no meaning but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find the lobbyist work was the NV Energy company, the main state-of-the-art company that supported the senator for a long time.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began working as a lobbyist in society, the head of Mr. Ensign's employees - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had ‘budget’ to the Home Ministry regarding the discussed subject.
Mr Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another New York client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of an airline after Mr. Hampton's hire of lobbyist work.
When the report on the Aphére first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned to his function as head of the fourth Republican in the Senate.
After many months of appointment, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third term of office in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the objective of investigating the criminal act of his spokesperson Jennifer Cooper said that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and will end the investigation.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing her personal work in the name of the Western people,” she said.
The challenge of Cheshire is to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the courtroom.
One minute after a minute, they sent news of terrible testimony over Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140 000 Twitter reports were involved in the rape and attachment of children to beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced to kill three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was to take the official end of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed a appeal with requests and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive submission of the process reports - including the extended use of Twitter's main reporters - created a \"circus atmosphere - and this extended, immediate penetration of information with blatant details then introduced a jury in decision-making in the sense of public influence.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether new rules in the courtroom are required with the start of new technologies.
“As I experienced in this overturn, I believe that the integration of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair process for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ulllmann, Chief Defense Officer Hayes.
The Judge of the process Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State has briefly rejected the claim concerning revenue from last week and that the media were closely controlled, and there are no evidence that the jury acted under public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that reporting of well known cases may raise questions about justice.
In the 1966 U.S. Supreme Court of the United States, Dr. Sam Sheppard canceled the condemnation of the Cleveland Chiropraktika for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that, in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, it was a “carnival atmosphere” in the process due to the media.
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration for television show and film, a shower,
Some lawyers said that the appeals that examined Hayes' rulings about half a century later could be surprised by the argument that the new rules could be needed to determine the way they communicate from the courtrooms, which was in the case of Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media,” said John J. Donohue III, Professor Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said that it was performed in any way.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be taken into consideration by the idea that the restriction of direct communication towards the courtrooms can make a process more fairer.
The Twitter case is only one of Mr. Hayes' many defendants who would be able to argue for years in order to maintain their judgment.
For example, advocates also argue that in Mr. Hayes’s case, for example, it may be a predisclosure when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential judges by showing them a crimeful photograph of the fearful.
Some of the judges said that they were apprehensive of the victim's photographs, which Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The advocates claim that they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge unlawfully dismissed the jury, who was critical to the state's representatives and that he misplaced his decision to put greater pressure on the verdict and direction the jury to reflect on the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They held in opposition to the verdict raised last month that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly breathing the flames of emotion in the matter of this case.
“The daytime media, cameras and reporters before the trial,” wrote a lawyer, “there was something that was not yet seen in New Haven and may also be a national rarity.
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the talks, some journalists argued that the immediate submission of reports was more encouraging than the reports later and, from their point of view, the judicial police should follow the area of scope of other processes.
However, some lawyers demanded appealing courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the spread of the process and wanted to clarify the demand that new media require new rules.
“This case,” wrote Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century,
Can politeness overcome the gap?
After a campaign that was remarkable by its insulting and negativism this week in Washington, a small amount of politeness appeared.
Is this the first flag of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusion moment before returning quickly to a party fight in the capital?
The Tuesday negotiations by President Obama and parliamentary leaders did not bring any major discoveries regarding the essential issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion of the opinions of two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than the other empty episode of the party's flood.
The mid-term public meeting of the Presidential Board was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close synergies for a few months have been building mutual respect, which is beyond the ideology that members continue to divide.
And it's pretty hard to say that a new era of cooperation began.
The two parties are now under trial - they assess each other's signs of collegy and compromise, trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the constituency of the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday negotiations and subsequent evaluation of participants were carried out with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change in the ratios that have been in place for the last two years.
Whether it is a question of taxes, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
The question is whether regulatory matters have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at Ethics and Public Policy Center.
-You're inevitable at the election.
The elections demolished the emotions of the strikers, and then they kept quiet.
It's good.
On several issues, especially those to discuss at meetings, the Republicans and Democrats have a little chance to find a solution.
Bush's tax reduction at the end of the year expired and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, as a likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because the Republicans cannot look at how they support tax reduction for property, while the unemployed reject unemployment support.
After the Tuesday negotiations at the White House, more optimistic about possible agreements on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening contract.
But William Galston of Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress calls for January.
More likely the period of non-conformity, or even inevitable, he said.
“In the short perspective, psychology will return to one of confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that politeness will lead them to real cooperation.
“I look at all events between present and 2012 as on the shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012,” he said.
The reasons are largely related to the compilation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
The Republican leaders now face the dangers of high schooling, know that they have to behave according to their promises and have to reduce government expenditure and repeal the new law on health care.
These pension lines are clear in the initial reactions to the deficit recommendations, which include the reform of the tax law and the increase in certain taxes, increasing pension age and reducing expenditure.
The Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, developed pressures of the deficit on the public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18th Member Commission, so that they can present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to draw closer to this number.
The greatest resistance is among the chosen officials in the jury who propose that we have, at least today, a small basis or a will for compromise in the case of financial questions.
Galston predicts two stages in battle between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first year will start in the form of partial conflicts, when the Republicans will call on Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, when the period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What's the direct shift?
Public opinion.
There are many evidence that, despite the partiality of the last elections, most Americans still want to see two sides that work together.
If it could go to the heel as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely monitored by public response.
Whoever threaten to reduce the votes will probably change the course and seek a compromise.
Could be an optimistic view of things.
Stranicity and proportionality are now greater than in the mid - 1990 ’ s, and it turns out that a greater ideologie between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans has been created than was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a pre-game to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
However, it will cost many efforts on both sides to find common foundations on the issues that they are still sharing.
The revealed American document sets out Moscow as a refuge to corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of “kleptocraticism”, and this continues part of the bribes and charges for protection that come on the way to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia in February records.
Both the Federal Security Service and the Federal Security Service hold largely protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal trades but also from organised crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the Bureau’s “versical” - will marry his when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The record that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accused him of a great deal of corruption.
He was called off in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only follow the minimum changes in the clear.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Basuina, who owns a prominent design company, has constantly denied corruption charges for many years, and he has won several accusations for perjury charges for such anticipation.
In September, he said to the Russian television station when he was asked to testify to corruption: “It’s crazy, it’s dirt, it’s bullshit.
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will show itself to the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also heard that they would do so by diplomats from foreign countries.
“The power of Moscow and its association with the criminal elements has led some to call it 'distinctive,' and confirm that the government operates more as troublecracy than as government,” says the report.
‘Criminal elements are looking forward to the so-called 'crisha' (the third of the world of crime and the mob which literally means 'the roof' or protection') which the police, Federal Security Service, Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Office of State Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
“Analytics have identified and three-stage structures in the criminal world of Moscow -
“Luzhkov is on the very top -
“Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and Milice are at second level”
Finally, at the lowest level are common criminals and corrupt inspectors -
“It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill out empty places in certain areas, as the city does not provide certain services,”
The report says FSB takes money from the largest companies and the police focus on smaller businesses.
One source said, “traders in Moscow are aware that it is better to obtain protection from FSB or the Ministry of Interior (as opposed to organised crime groups), since they have no more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.
- For this reason, the protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course -
The record says that while choosing money is comprehensive, protection alone can already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their business is closed under different pretenses.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he only made little progress.
The embassy report is about men taking bags, probably in a rush of cash, to Kremlin himself.
“In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team Indem.
\"But he is part of this bureaucracy--
“It is not part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia any longer -
Without politicians, without opposition, without power distribution, corruption is inevitable, he said.
In India, it is estimated that Russia costs more than 300 billion dollars a year in its nationwide corruption.
The country ranges to 154th place in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGOs of the Transparency International.
The discovery of the American embassy's report, which appeared in Moscow until late evenings, certainly did not create enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the point that, for Moscow's shortcomings, Luzhkov may be charged, it may be the possibility for Kremlin to argue about solving the problem.
When talking to CNN with Larry King, Putin said that the documents that WikiLeaks published could be counterfeits and reacted angryly to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
“The truth about the whole matter is that it is about our mutual synergies, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
But in order to be honest, we did not think that it would be done with such arrogantness, with such a pressure, you understand, so inexorably--
The veterans of the Red Godfathers are forced to cope with the past
The head of Anlong Veng High School, who built it, was the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
-Everyone here loves Ta Moka -
“He was a good leader and took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the “cuttle”, for his sovereignty during the Red Khmer government, remains the commander in this distant holding of the Red Khmers in North West Cambodia popular where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up, it's crashed a long-lasting loyalty also in Anlong Veng.
In April, sacrifices were made to the forum of truth and reconciliation to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July bring together the UN and Cambodia's court the first condemnation of the former Red Khmer member, a sentence of a former leader, a notorically known violent association of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years of prison.
With all such progress, there was an increase in restlessness between the Red Khmer vets in Anlong Veng, which complicated the efforts to reconcile and try to reconnect into the Kambány Society.
“The former Red Khmers is enraged and fearful, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, the Head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
“For them, life was wonderful between the Red Khmers, but the regime became a symbol of evil.
-It divides families -
During the reign of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, according to estimates 1,7 million people were executed or died of hunger, sickness or rework.
When the Vietnamese attacked and deposed the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and his soldiers fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara were driving partisan wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated a standup in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid - 1990 ’ s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The great group of Red Khmer fighters began to go to the government, which went up to Ieng Sara’s surrenders in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, which lasted, was captured by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 during waiting for trial.
Their mercenaries no longer cared for them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters have fallen into the ordinary Kambodž rural life, and many of them nostalgically remembers the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
“These people have only had minimum benefits from surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and reconciliation, which leads public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
They're surrounded by utopian agular ideology of the regime.
‘They have been brought up without any idea of the implementation of trade;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in a jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled down as a poor farmer in 1998.
“Life under the Red Khmer was good,” he said.
- That's where Mok enjoyed all of them -
But now life is hard, because we have to secure everything ourselves.
The ongoing judgment of the Red Khmers also raises concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court starts investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Khmers.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the manager of the rebuttal and the people responsible for crimes, but has not been told whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was just a little bit to calm down the concerns in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, which was a regional leader in the Bantey Meanchey province during the Red Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma dams, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Last night Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirty trip outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows appeared through the dusty grass, Im Chaem refused to speak about her past between the Red Khmers.
If the court had called her in, she would refuse to go.
“In Cambodia, peace is in place and stable,” she said.
“If other criminal prosecutions occur, war will be“
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court were to seek further suspects, although experts and historians disagree with it.
“The house must dig a hole deep and bury the past in it,” he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chang Youk from the documentation center.
“Smoking in Khmerian ratios means blinding broken pieces,” he said.
\"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand--
The Centre published the first textbook approved by the Government of the Red Khmer, has 75 pages and the title “History of Democratic Cambodia”
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides about the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only little detail about the Red Khmers, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents responded sceptically when he took home a book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and courts,” he said.
“They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will prosecute the court.”
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more difficult and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbooks, and the court are beginning to have influence, he said further.
The Red Khmers still have a strong spell.
The mountain in the Mountains of Dangre Mounts is a road grown by a weed and filled with a plastic bag that leads to a rectangle of black bees, covered with a rustic sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, mobile van on the edge of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated in that place.
“But he has a strong spirit, many local people walk here and pray to him,” she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday, and she was planning to visit a place of rest of Pol Pot, where she would bring a bunch of mature bananas in hope it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to be its weapons supply on the basis of uranium
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign regarding the provision of nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced at the centre that they would surrender their supply of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Security Summit of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergeie Martynova.
For years, the US government tried to convince Belarus to give up a highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit a stone of injury last spring.
But American officials said The Washington Post that several undercover operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared land for the midterm agreement to eliminate the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to an official who spoke on anonymity condition, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement has proved to be one of the most important results of Obama 47.
And it was probably a good move to ensure that the former Soviet Republic was invited to a subsequent summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 nuclear security summit -
“This proves that the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, the president of the Partnership for Global Security, the nuclear security groups.
Clinton called the agreement as a major, important step from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, that they would secure all the sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to rid all its supplies of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
During Obama's nuclear security summit, President Alexander Lukasnko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium,” Lukašenko said.
We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell it to anyone.
“We use it only for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus has joined the United States a few months ago and has shown interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was lightened, reported to officials.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles into the Russian storage and disposal facility, told the officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday, and it was carried out on air, told the officials.
The U.S. government spent $113 million on the program, most of it to deliver to the Belarusian Research Institute less enriched uranium, which is not enough to produce nuclear weapons.
“All have been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust, which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Baniaewski, official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Three Redution.
James Martin Center for the Non-Proliferation Study this year estimated that Belarus has at least £88 of the uranium used to produce weapons.
Belarus will, in accordance with the joint declaration, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tight for years, especially because of the Lukasenko cruel repression of human rights.
But the Wednesday statement indicates the possibility of a gradual tattoo.
“We are seeing progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the country’s progress and its people,” he said.
The Spanish government didn't do drugs with CIA flights
The Spanish government did not do drugs about CIA flights of prison Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guantánama via the Spanish territory, as expressed in its telegram by the United States of Madrid.
Thus, it follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks journal El País, where it also says that the first Prime Minister María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vegan asked for Spanish exekutiva to be informed so that he could show that he had proper supervision of foreign aircraft through Spanish airspace.
A meeting between Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de La Vega took place in June 2006, following a Communication from the Council of Europe in which a dozen states were accused, including Spain.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the message of the Council of Europe - brought Zapater's rule out of the game - insisted that Spain has nothing to hide on this matter.
De la Vegan stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights across its territory.
“Only they want to be informed, so that they are not unprepared, reports Aguirre in one of the documents.
In addition, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish government was willing to give this matter as low as possible, but by means of this matter being in the hands of the judges, he had limited possibilities to influence.
In February 2007, the D.A. Vicente González said that, as far as it concerns it, he does not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the withdrawal of documents from the National Centre for Secret Service (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence relating to CIA flights.
‘This information does not contain any incriminated file or sensitive information,’ explained the embassy after the interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns rather because of clear coordination between the Spanish Judges and German prosecutors, rather than because of the disclosure of CNI information or the Ministry of Defence.
“This coordination between independent experts will make our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments,” regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of lunch by Ambassador Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the ambassadors that the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate - he already gave instructions to his co-workers, - and they will avoid angry comments with the intention of reducing tension -
The ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political conduct of Party Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - I.D.) on this matter.
- Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partyo Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any sign that Zapater's government tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if this revelation could have negative consequences for the Government of the United States - it is noted.
The admitted mother-marriage complained on the network of parent - old age -
A young woman talked about a child when she was dead, and she had her blog: “Teror in Galician“
Mónica Juanatey Fernández says “Muki” on the Internet
with this nickname that she used since, she communicated with her cousin and at least once a friend; both of them are from the village of Noah in the area of La Corunia from which a young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, you need to know the woman's emotional life, which the ABC daily rebuilds with the help of the testimony of her family members.
The 13th woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with the industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if he was a newborn child, but his ex-girlfriend never let a DNA test.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their use took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When a girl went to Balearian islands looking for a job, she stayed with her partner who even came to Palmy for a week.
However, the content of its communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorce and writes: “Alberto is some angry that I went to work--
“When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he must be with a small day and can’t do what he wanted to do”
Then she's talking about the text message she just got: \"I want you to come back this month or give me an address where to send you a child.\"
He complains: “If he does not like me to leave a little girl with my mother, I will marry him when I return,” he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his residence: ‘This week I will go there, but I will only stay until 19, because 20. I have to go for work to lose the place.’
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to himself.
“It will be with who it is to be with, so with me, and it will never happen again in my life that I will leave him with someone other than my mother, a questionable purpose given to her bad relationship.
There's another post in July.
When using this report, the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month is expected to have been murdered by 10, is already dead.
“César is satisfied on one side, but on the other, it is not--
\"On the one hand, he's with me, and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day.\"
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
\"I'm going to go to summer school, and I'm going to save some money for the nanny.\"
Seven-year-old greetings and complaints.
“A big kiss from Caesar who asks me when you're coming”
\"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos he wants, look how he's going to meet me, sex is needed.\"
Thirty more news: “Kluk is well, goes to summer school to learn Catalan“
There is also one message about the Emperor, the current partner: ‘He gives me money’
On the Internet there are Móni's contributions on the blocks dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she had to say, ‘Muki ex-wissian’
-Teror in Galician (motto) -.
The last man she lived with, the keeper, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
The mónica entered the province book in Palma, where she arrived from the Vase Center in Menorce yesterday.
The advocate, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant did not remember how everything happened and “that she had no intention of harming a small one. ”
But before that, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
The prosecution and the D.A. also require psychiatric examinations.
People would receive 4 chairs and PSCs in the House (Sociistic Party of Catalan - Read more) would lose 9 mandates
with the results of November 28, the PP side could have the main word on the councils in Lérida, Taragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (the People's Party of Catalan - I know) already has the idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually once compared to Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610.473 votes in general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections only 3162.22.
Last Sunday, PCP received 384.091 votes.
If this trend of upbringing, which was supported by the transfer of votes from PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, analysts of this party calculated that if the elections were held general, PCC could obtain 12 Members in the House compared to the current 8, the CIU side (Convergence i Unió, Czech Association and Union) would also receive four mandates (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalana has a major importance for the parties of PP and PSOE.
According to this analysis, the People's Party would have lost one Member - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiatives for Catalan - I.C.) would still have one mandate or another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest addition will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where people might also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist superpower in four major province cities, as well as changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administration with the largest expected budget - €61 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree to the possibility that the PSC could lose the city hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive most and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
In view of the Republican debut, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representative - since at least 5% of the votes need to be obtained.
PP has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play the main role in the turnover of Tarragon, where they ruled together with a party to PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida only received 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
Humans also received on other important councils such as Badalon, Castellldeels or Reus.
Currently, PP has representations at 34 councils in Catalan and would like to create candidates for as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided by Al-Kaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven held in Barcelona, the next three were held in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and one Nigerian, who were arrested by the agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona, formed a Jajiddistic cell managed from Thailand, which established travel passports to various groups of Al-Kaida organisations, among which were also ‘Tiggor of the liberation of the Tamil Ílam’ or ‘Lashkar-e-Taiba’, and the second group was the author of the Athens in Mumbai, with which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to this matter, aims to ensure that Kampai's activities are implemented - the weakening of Al-Kaida's counterfeit aparate at international level and thus to limit its operational capabilities.
The investigators estimate that this cell could have been active in Catalan during two years, sending thousands of passports to Thailand, then counterfeiting, and then supplied to groups that form a criminal galaxy of Al-Qaeda, in order to allow their fighters to travel forever across Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active network in Europe, and therefore these investigations were involved in other European police forces in addition to Thai services, and therefore cannot be excluded from the fact that there will be similar intervention in other European countries in the coming days, such as last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistani Junaid Humalog, Atiqur Rehman, Jabra Asghar, Malik Iphtikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeria Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested by Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were just those men driving from Bangkok's cell located in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was destroyed in 2009, especially the tourist passports that met the requirements of the Islamics.
This means that documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, had to be valid for several years and without marked visas.
In the investigation documents, it is stressed that there are no facts yet known that would link to the French attaché to the Attate in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, “Lashkar-e-Taiba” should be one of the groups that have taken the passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that several days before this attack, some thousands of dollars have been sent from the Catalan transfer agency to purchase cards on mobile phones that later have been used by members -comanda - who have killed 106 people.
The police have already taken up a lot of evidence.
The human party (PP) requires Masa to stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PCC (Lidové stránska) Alicia Sánchezová-Camach had the opportunity to give himself to Arthur Masa, under which he is willing to support his introduction to President Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to reanimate the economy and conflict with risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists wants to propose during their mandate.
The President of the Catalan People has reached a meeting with Artur Mas with certainty 18 Members' chairs received in elections from last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory to obtain the ceremony, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations of the opposition to refrain from voting for its entry into office.
The possible agreement with PP depends on future alliances which the nationalists in the House would like to hold when the general elections are held, but, so far, the talks that are held in Mas with the rest of political leaders are in Catalan spirit.
With regard to the president of PP, in order to obtain its support for putting in office, ‘it will have to end with all the sovereign and exclusive speeches - as with the Economic Agreement - similar to the Basque One - which CiU leader wanted to even vote in a referendum.
The two leaders would like to undermine the excessive political aparate of autonomous administration and reduce the inheritance tax and donation tax.
The details of the Masova negotiations will be discussed within the framework of PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
The meat has already met Joaquine Nader (PSC) who promised to be a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and is meeting with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidat Catalana).
The manager of the geriatric device ensures that death has not occurred as a result of a non-measured nature,
Centre presentation Olot does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) was provided yesterday by a press conference to identify the damage caused by the institution of the criminal behavior of Joana Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who, in the meantime, had been employed here - killed by at least eleven seniors he had in his care.
The director of this home for the Senor Joan Sala came along with a lawyer of the facility, a lawyer named Joan Canada, and announced that, by giving home to La Caritat it would be able to charge charges against a guiltyer, responsible for the killing, but the law and responsibility of us are obliged to leave this process to the competent authorities.
In addition to damage to the good name that this institution may suffer due to the fact that it did not reveal the criminal activities of the carekeeper, the great threat to the home La Caritat now represents the material compensation requirements that already calculate the legal representatives of the deceased families.
Joan Villa Dilmé admitted that his first crime was already in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the home for seniors to suspect that in many cases no doctor looked personally at the deceased, but that, given the age and poor health condition of the patients, everything was done on the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through her Director, refused this extreme and stressed that, in no way, the lack of measures could have been the cause of what happened.
The lawyer La Caritat added that, in the case, there are no indications that, in addition to his own accused person, any third party would have committed a doubt,
The man who was now “the Angel of Death” admitted yesterday 11 killings and specified that the first crime committed on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old man by a month and a half later.
in this case, death caused the administration of too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case when used a mixture of calming tablets.
Director La Caritat said it's complicated to check staff's access to meditation.
Insulin and cocktail sedativ were probably in six cases with nine means used by this caregiver to kill patients in their efforts to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now being conducted in the laboratory should show whether Villa is lying and actually looking for his first victims less cruel death or, on the contrary, killing them by louhu, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, he does not believe in medical claims and does not even rule out that the number of killed may be higher than he admitted to, and justify his conduct in various versions of the court's judgment, knowing that he must change his actions when it came to show that he killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want to be available for justice to be illuminated by the whole range of this matter.
The European Central Bank is at risk
The investors responded strongly yesterday to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, which pointed out that the markets should not underestimate our ability to respond.
The external differentials have been closed by force and the shares of the European Bank have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just increased over critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-destruct market, which, although there is a decline, is recovered - but due to a short and very speculative position.
Investor will take some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow will have to call off the fourth in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of state debt for ineffectiveness and elimination of all exceptional liquidity rates within a period of time and leave unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted by-at least by March - and will receive three months' licitation with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations they will restore the market response from yesterday, and if they continue to remain blind in the collection of liquidity rates, God will with us!
It was the same at a convention in May where they claimed that they did not even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets - tomorrow could repeat history.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armored fist announced it on Monday and on Wednesday it said that she had already bought many of them, resulting in another collapse of the market.
Last year's exchange rate for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only spent 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in mood in the market that followed the words of Trichet.
in Ireland, the figures represent the loss of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after in July the problem has not revealed stress tests, the amounts are acceptable and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to obtain approval by the new Parliament budget, and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland continues to be insecure.
Angela Merkel reduced the tone of her speech to release tension in her face for the next meeting of the EU peak on December 14, on which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are a union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner while others prefer Beethoven Oda for joy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction in deficits, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - to the ears of investors it sounds like four annual periods from Vivaldi.
The dual effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish storm increased by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as other European storms.
Unlike February, the government response and the Spanish national bank was swift and convincing - we are looking forward to the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a key bond licitation for three years, which will benefit Trichet, because of which we hope, there will be a great demand for it, which will help to distract doubt about our refinanceability.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-defence for Spain.
They'd give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would be closed to the hay die.
However, the strategy of Cesar's wife must continue to be used - not to be, but also to seem -
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group is going to attack Vega Sicily's children.
The storm in an open conflict in the Alvares family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, will not be happy.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will be attacked after having taken it into account for an insignificant - the legal conduct of El Enebro planned for 16th month and the required five of his seven offspring, at which these should try to force their majority and strengthen themselves with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are in charge of the legal group for the new chapter of their dispute on the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to rely in its dispute on membership in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
Five of its seven children were established from its administration committee, who were appointed forefathers during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January this year and objected to them in the Commercial Register.
El Enebro’s hearings planned for the 16th month, which was called by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, restored the fluctuation in the womb of the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means guaranteed by the Commission's call.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Álvarez Mezquirizi consider David Álvarez to be a desperate means of his five children serving by means of a court of justice and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of 18 January, which was totally invalid.
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this act as a result of an insignificant -
Protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried to bring the court down in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned alongside other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Álvareze 100% of the capital.
However, the founding of the group according to family protocols requires 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when the question of a judicial assault has been changed. The date of such a trial has not yet been established.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull fell into Formula 1 series in 2004, his history in this exceptional world of speed is characterized by surprises and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new arrival team, and despite the rising tendencies of recent times, all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alons.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine capabilities that drive his car, in the world of Formula 1 were born a legend - a “secret weapon” by which multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is an efficient simulation software of derivatives that the German company put on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for high accuracy devices.
Its aim is to reproduce the product faithfully or stimulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon camera, Suchoi aircraft or the most famous utility vehicles of the Nissan brand.
Siegfried Russwurm, the leading industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software device has enabled Red Bull to perform a few hours, in almost real time, the modification and improvement that are otherwise detected during races and tests.
In 1992, Russwurm says that in 1992 they were employed with a average of 10 technicians capable of carrying out a maximum of three or four improvements over one period.
on the Red Bull team today works on 180 highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology that analyze and design each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours due to advanced production systems using laser and highly advanced autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up approximately 50 km from London's top technology race to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are limited to visitors - especially journalists.
All that is happening here is considered a “great secret”
The list of participants in this project consists of 580 people including two pilots - Champion Vettela and Mark Webber.
Hrdina Red Bull is in Formula 1 without doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable and no one knows it.
The head of production technology Steve Neney claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was the merit of the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth the success of 85% while pilots contribute to 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer techniques, since they are non-predictable gladiators -
HP will establish 20 own stores in cooperation with local distributors within two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes yesterday opened her first exclusive shop in Barcelona.
This company will be the first of the 20 trades in the area of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing commercial houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Ingles.
The Vice President of the Spanish HP Helena Herrer stated as an example of a newly renewed sale to Barcelona Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has set up a plan for the establishment of 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belarus (Serbsko), then the trade in Barcelona is third.
Herrer didn't want to reveal where other shops would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrerová, also leading HP personnel systems, ensured that the philosophy of opening stores will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with exclusive sales equipment (with products that can be interactively tested) which will be identical in Europe.
Besides, HP also deals with the provision of business personnel.
Helena Herrer said that it would be a franchising and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, serving, selling service and even packaging.
The trade in Barcelona is part of a global pilot pionary program aimed at addressing any problems with computer equipment in a guarantee.
Online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Nizzie).
So we can solve problems within 10 minutes that may otherwise take up to two days -
“This system is designed specifically for SMEs and for regular customers, since large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service,” highlighted Helena Herrerová yesterday.
Sabadell is betting that it will steal, within three years, its competitors have a million clients.
More optimal than other bosses, the delegate of Bank Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be demanding for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, which will try to compensate for the reduction of bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and thus survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to the survival without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by inciting millions of new private clients - respectably 700,000, if any, to withdraw the bank - since until now and the constitution has moved small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50.000 companies.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another fundamental idea of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it is also possible to say soberness, in order to reduce the cost of which the bank's challenges will show when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, a small bank institution dares to set targets and publish them as the financial crisis has changed all the world banking plans.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme, established four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension to another period.
Clients who leave the savings will be their main target group.
At the meeting organised by APIE, Guardian insisted that 2011 will be a heavy and very important year -
Indeed, the way out of the crisis in Spain - will be long - suffering -
In addition, it will be difficult to create employment in two or three years - which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that a passive war - which reduces the margin - goes away, the price of a premium for the risk that banks and savings pay for their emissions to receive liquidity, is already moving to credit prices, which compensates for the reduction of the margin.
‘This liquidity and funding is structural and will represent a pressure factor on loans’
“We haven’t closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high,” said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22, November 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking is a reduction in commissions, but there is a competitive framework here -
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not for nothing to ensure that in Spain, they will require greater size -
The stone will not remain on the stone for the next year.
It confirms that the needs of the capital are well reduced, and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions enter between red numbers.
It points out that the FROB can in the market to compensate for the collection of funds before the new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remains a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding by means of a tariff response, which reduces the crisis.
CECA excludes the next wave of mergers combined
The Director-General of CECA refused yesterday that another wave of merger should be formed together and again insisted on the speed with which the sector reorganisation is carried out.
When he launched the process of pooling Spanish companies, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase would not take part and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should be created.
‘I believe that most mergers have already been implemented, the incorporation of Cajasol to Banca Civica group cannot be considered as a second round, what happens is the Convention’.
“The majority are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish national bank, which cooperated very well on this matter, the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (the Association of leading and executive officials of Aragon) Olavarrieta ruled out that the concentration process is being carried out - at the highest possible speeds and we must be very satisfied as shown in the instalments that are in their time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the National Bank of Spain - stressed.
The average amount of assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that does not have a comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are larger and thus falling in line with the Basel Treaty.
Olavarrieta recognised that “there are a number of unlucky views on the slowness of the process, which show that there is a lack of seriousity and understanding - because what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind that we must be on a date before the end of the year.”
The CEO of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ensured that Spain has the strictest financial system throughout Europe and, more likely, in the world, and to those who question it, has attributed the lack of knowledge to Spain.
The Director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, we can be calm - as regards financial institutions and a system which he managed - the very important - the process of concentration and which continues - the highest possible speed -
He also reminded that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro but has fixed the conditions for the whole Union.
The tension on the markets has provoked two government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from the tax reduction for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private brokering agencies or the cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed persons without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spain airports and air traffic management - I know. over.), Barajas and El Prat Airport operator and 30% state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, joined the criticisms at the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel because of her responsibility for the launch of the current crisis.
How do we interpret this move?
In advance, Merkel's opinion is not an error in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complicated process of redeficiency of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of how his future should be, which leads to the idea of respecting old traditions, which holds a large part of the other members.
In the face of European opposition, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
The first is a strong Eurozone, a part of which is Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to march - although now it can appear as a scofi, this version has a wide public support that is approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is that according to the German proposals for redistributing the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary pressure, fines for guilty states, possible deductions of payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible costs for regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has already been defined for some time, so there is no room for the train now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German Government has pulled from the sleeve of the Constitutional Reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (the fiscal pressure plans and the stability of public finances) and the practice of its European partners, including France.
The second showed this Middle European country when Merkel was painfully making decisions about the rescue of Greece.
It has already been subject to sharp criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which has also been published, has been strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in recent October, Merkel again appeared with a clear opinion when she requested to reform the European Union Convention so as to allow the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, to have the privacy of creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat reduced form, has been approved, and in the coming months we should monitor the reform process of the Union, which should allow those measures to be taken from 2013.
Germany has specified a red line that will not be exceeded.
And he tells us all that although it is now necessary to take measures that are likely to disagree with too much, from that date, the euro will end with the old functioning.
2013 will present the birth of a new monetary zone, in which Member States breaching the rules that are heavily penalised and may be forced to report the disbursement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany tells us that we need to put ourselves on a firm path of growth with an increase in savings and investment, moderate consumption, improvement in productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which ruled in the years of the boom of Spain’s growth, simply does not tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we hadn't understood.
It is not only a renewal of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we might be wrong about ourselves.
I hope that these current turbines will be more peaceful.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us in spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) make it known that, despite criticisms, the Merkels had opened the path to the idea that things should be fixed.
However, the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities to be considered, it is not possible to rule out the euro area as a whole of too many serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and cover of rules
The Fintys that Alonso and Ramos presented in the fight with Ajax show no intention of escapeing the punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alons and Sergio Ramose) in the match of the League of Masters against Ajax from November 23 caused the sea to die in ink about whether this is or is not unportable behavior and whether or not EUFA should punish the two football players.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly won) named players one after another deliberately lost the time at the time when it was supposed to play the faul, so to provoke the barrel, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfill their prescribed punishment in the following fight against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end up in his band in the forehead - and they will be able to get rid of cards, continue to the next phase.
Finally, she granted a disciplinary commission to UEFA coach José Mourinho for two matches and guilty players received cash fines.
The design of yellow cards under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the étos football, i.e. the rules that are unscheduled, but they're watching.
Part of the discussion in this case was created due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (which in his anthem boasts nobleness and honors, and which has already been penitentiating his players for similar acts) and, as it seems, thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinhem, which thus adds to his long history of comedy and the provocator of another episode.
In any case, the debate is about whether this kind of act that is not specifically prohibited is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a breach of law; it is indeed an action which respects sports rules, whose meaning seems to be trying to bypass.
What kind of damage such an act is said to be a sporty spirit.
One of the appropriateness of sport behaviour is the physical indifference of opponents, which has not been violated in these cases, or if there has been no violent game.
Another of these elements that characterise the pure game is to avoid the players from having an advantage towards the team of opponents - which has not happened here either.
Thus, the paradoxy to the action of the players of Real Madrid is the fact that we do not normally characterize what we characterize as a lest or circumvention of law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour was to be as evident as possible with the aim of the punishment.
They waited and they loved to get the penalty.
Another question, however, is the benefit of the guilty of their intentionary offense.
Here it is necessary to say that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that there is no benefit in the current match, because the evident consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for another match, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
Clearly, the advantage is that players will start another phase of the League of Masters without cards that could jeopardise their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from the long term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first sight the team may be eliminated, and in spite of this, the players of the penalty will recover, and will go to the second round of cards, in which only one card will be excluded less than in the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be quite clear whether this is an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against a sports spirit which is part of making strategic decisions that will allow maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case of which we are dealing with here, players should not aim to avoid the granting of punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of rules), but rather choose when to be subject to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although there is no limit between důvtip and circumventing the rules quite clear, I believe that in this case, it was clearly about the court.
It seems to me that the pole arises for two reasons: because it was two self-departures, and because of the way in which the instructions were transmitted to their decommissioning from the management.
The damage to sports principles by these events is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers about having Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dict concentrates this year's reservation on 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations played by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros quickly come.
Like the Turkish honey or lottery, the preschool parties that still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and facilities for leisure in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis resulted in a fight against clients by price reduction: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the question of entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
In order to complete the complication of numbers, he focused on the calendar this year (when the Christmas Day came on Friday) the applications for a week from 13 December, resulting in a cheap reservation for days at the top (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the skinny years started, there are many companies which collective parties have canceled for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave tradition, many employees pay their own money at parties.
No matter the situation, many demand prices at the limit of kidnapping, the President claims the association of the Gremi de Restaurantó de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
At this moment, the representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities does not dare to predict what celebrations this month will be.
The people will think well before they make reservations -
“They want to come out, but as far as prices are concerned, they are careful to add.
Shops will go well to those who offer quality and good service at a favorable price, saying and reminds that, thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go a step down, and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
The survey in various facilities shows that the biggest proportion of the request for booking is on the evening of December 17.
Soteras reported actual reservations for this Friday, with the most requirements for losses up to 30 euros adapted to the menu offered, the total prices of which are between 25 and 30 euros.
in another important company, which is Andilana, reading 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the speciality of this calendar more early reservations from the beginning of November.
“We have made possible even impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, each of which should be chosen, move from 19.95 to 30 euros, report.
In the AN group of groups that include El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and total 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have recorded an increase in profits since the second half and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas markets.
The sources of this society point out that December 18 will also be a busy day, as the pre-accession celebrations between friends will take place.
to their six group menu they added Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, because they recorded a 10% more exchange in comparison with last year’s guests’ trend for other items such as coffee (Slovak wine - already mentioned).
They also noted that companies that again call their employees appear, and the size of the group seems to be slightly larger.
Vice-President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of bars, restaurants and centers of free time in Barcelona) Enrico Goma believes that it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has been relived - although the clients - agree on maximum -
This impression, even during the Christmas celebrations, did not come forward, so that whoever pays the price, would point out.
Pakistan’s nuclear program produced great restlessness in the USA
Islamada produces nuclear weapons faster than any other country.
Wikileaks documents confirm the ties between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks, confirms an extraordinary unrest in Washington, which encourages Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to the clarifying and important details that offer regarding the content of communication and ideas of representatives of the North American diplomat in Islambad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states with regard to nuclear safety is a place to increase, - is at a retreat - and that this unstable Asian country produces -more nuclear weapons than any other state -
The strangeness of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after the works to prevent their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's divinity.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Pattson in one report before visiting the national safety advisor James Jones: ‘A closeness of certain nuclear equipment against the territory under the control of the Taliban, alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials,
The increased number of persons associated with the nuclear arsenals and with the control program of the missiles is no longer observed but Russia, as it is spreading and representing the reason to be alert.
“The Pakistani had to hire staff with strict religious faith, given the collapse of education and culture levels, have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes controlled by the shootings” said the expert Jurij Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their counterparts from the US.
The largest new documentation published by Julian Assange server is increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the issues of the spread of nuclear weapons and the increased rate of the Pakistani production of these weapons.
Depose issued by the embassy in May, which qualifys communication with Pakistan as ‘frustrating’, says: ‘Transparence often does not exist; offers of aid remain without notice or are rejected;
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that, despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world,
Ambassador Pettson also asks Washington to end the military chief General Ashfaq Kayani during his visit, to be very clear - that the “Pakistan army must end up with silent support to terrorist groups” -
Hon on Wikileaks boss
Obama calls on a highly built-in worker responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a red challenge to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of facts.
The interpol yesterday announced the extraordinary challenge of red note, to relocate and follow the movement of Assange.
However, it is not a classic arrest warrant.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with sexual abuse charges that Australians face in Sweden.
Next to this, the legal representative of Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures that “police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang”
It was 20 November when the International Police Corps, based in French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, did not publish it until yesterday, when he received authorisation from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange in order to set up temporary ties on it and issue it.
Although Interpol cannot order detention of the person involved in the red challenge, many Member States, as explained by the organisation, consider the so-called red note for arresting - this must be ensured by the national police component - especially if the States have a bilateral agreement on issuing detained, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be found.
This step worsened Asseng's lawyers, who published the writing yesterday, where they claim that the nine-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of Swedish authorities using videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge asked and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutors of their case, which compares with legendary Lavrentij Pavlovič Berijou, chef of Stalin's security.
“This is a hunt and not a legal persecution,” says a letter.
While the whole world is looking for it - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange is still in an unknown place, however, he does not shut up.
On Monday, he provided Skype with an interview from an unknown place to interview the editor of Time magazine - in this interview he requested the demission of the Foreign Minister of the United States Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for the orders of the U.S. diplomats to conduct espionages in the United Nations and to violate the international conventions signed by the United States, he should withdraw,” he said.
His opinion yesterday was rejected by the press spokesperson Robert Gibbs's White House, who qualified the demand for demission as “smoking and absurd“
“I am not entirely sure why we should care about the individual that operates the website,” said CNN.
Obama himself entrusted a highly built-in worker responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The intention of President Barack Obama to stop adding Assang to the importance contrasts with the views that have failed these days with conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, chaired by the Lower Sea National Security Committee since January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility to include Wikileaks among terrorist organisations, to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance to them.
Tom Flanagan went further, an advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who declared Assange to be killed, which he had to call off.
“Obama should put a reward on him or use an unmanned plane or something like that.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist priest, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for president.
“Whoever will be in the government, whoever is responsible for the leak of information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” he declared at Fox Station.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC - by mutilating - on the supporter of Cardoda
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on their continuation.
Huguet proposes more plural exectivation and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerós seems to have found a recipe to combat several hundred internal revolutions in the ERC series (Levica Republican Party of Catalana - I.D.), as a result of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding the demission seems to be the supporters of the former leader Josepa Lluíse Cardodo-Rovory insufficient, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as his leader itself today, and that he cannot absolutely cause him the kind of trouble he had with other blackout streams.
That's why Lice's leader will try to get new criticisms using a cloud that will help him defend himself in the general elections.
First Puigcercós yesterday announced that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able to secretly refer to his maintenance as a function.
With voice leaves, not by lifting your hand.
If Carod’s supporters want to give the President a criminal voice, they will be able to do so without fear of respite measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the divorce and the subject of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered to be confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added without clarifying the percentage that there would also be no good outcome - after Bulgaria -
The Stoupenists of Cardoda demand more than to give their function available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, because Puigcerós controls the largest organ at the conventions.
But given that they do not have enough majority to force demission, they will try to make an excellent point to the plan from now on to May.
Because of this, they expect to participate in the development of a strategic reorientation document, which will give the lead to vote by the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcerós in exchange for the promise to move the Congress in autumn 2011.
The ERC leader stated that ‘mno-hodity’ harms stability and that its objective is that once and for all, the organisation is able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it appears to be an important article, which currently counsellor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into consideration Puigcercós' ideolologist, he took this innovator for the finished cause that the leader would be confirmed for several objectives:
And they named five, two of them.
The first is to recompose, executives to represent at least 90% of members, which also means to include new faces that are from the sector called Cardod.
The second target can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC be completely completed by the meeting as a functioning mechanism.
And so he fights for reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through the delegates selected by voting.
Concluding with the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system is the intended goal of Puigcercós' team, who has already fought at the last two conventions in this direction.
However, the 2008 Christian Assembly decided that the meeting had to be assessed at the Special Congress on Reforms.
This issue is still unsolved, as the situation inside the Party has rejected the solution to this issue.
Now, without critique sectors, it could be a good time to deal with this matter again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for November; 390 for 2010
According to the journal MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decline of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as MILENIO said.
There are cases of three women between the murders and a couple of separate bodies in Mexico Valley.
In the last month of the year, they count in Mexico a total of 390 killings, probably linked to organised crime.
In between cases there is a finding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the Toluca district.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, and also a blow from grace to the head, and had hands and legs tied with ropes.
The next day a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecs street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, in the Naucalpan district.
Soon on Thursday 4th November, the teammen discovered a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body, there was a report signed by the most likely criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
About a day later, a 50-year-old man was killed in Niehualcóotl, after he came out of his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec district.
in Chalco was found on a remote road in El Naranjo's colony by a man shot in the forehead, and under the body a bullet from a gun of a calibre 25.
in Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewer water in the Playa Golondrin colony.
The rescue files have made a thorough search for other parts of it, but they have not been found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported the finding of the body with their hands tied back to the back and depleted heads on Pena Colorado.
A man had a bullet wound from a gun on his back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in bed linen and left in the luggage space of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district was reported to the victims as a threat of death.
The day later was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz, a cardboard box that contained the human head.
The rest of the body was found in the near colony, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
The 17th were found in two dead women wrapped in the bed linen in the Zoquiapan settlement in the Ixtapaluca district, and the second morning was found dead men wrapped in yellow sheets, which was initially left behind by the accident in his body, identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in San Francisco Acuautla without signs of life with two wounds into the back.
On the skin of a woman, a tattoo of Santa Muerte's sacred characters was discovered (seriously - Holy Death - I know.
At the end of the month, a man's corpse was found in the village of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found, who had their head wrapped with a belt and found a message in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The report was probably written by one of the criminal organisations in which it stood: ‘This will happen to those who do not adapt.’
There were two bodies found in Ecatepec, which carried signs of torture and had tied limbs inside the abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month were found by the remains of two men in the Los Reyes La Paz districts and Nehualcoyotl.
The first was to wipe and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left with a message; while the other was washed and found in a plastic package in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together, they found an agent and a message ticket.
China complies with its target to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of this country at the UN climate change conference COP16 ensured that its country has developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprints and has specified that it insists on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public performance at the 16th Conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that its country has developed enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested 245 million dollars in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
However, he noted that China would not change its objectives and continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change issues is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
Furthermore, it stressed that the federal authorities co-operated in China with the authorities of the provinces and locals in order to achieve their targets in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he has said, they are in progress or have already completed various multiannual plans, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
This is, for example, the programme for the efficient use of energy which has been introduced over the last five years, which received investments from the UN, governments and private initiatives.
There is also a development project of climate change, a project for the exchange of lamps for saving bulbs and a project of mitigation and adaptation, specified.
At the same table, Martin Krarol, an expert advisor to this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than in general thought.
For example, emissions of greenhouse gases per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of its historical share in emissions.
Also, it has developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased by 20% in energy efficiency over the last five years and expects further progress by 2020 to be made.
Espin: César Nava
The National President of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - Čerk.) said that the former President of this party is entitled to request his rights with the National Order Commission.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vazquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientose was illegal, and that the former chairman of this party is entitled to contact the National Committee of Economics and demand his rights.
in an interview that was ordered before the statement of objections by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espin is, in any case, a decision taken at local level.
“This is about the autonomous decision of the Peace Commission in Sonore,
“Mr Espino has the right to address in his case through complaints against the National Council's Security Committee, in order to add a decision made by a competent authority.
In addition, he explained that now there is no time to think for 2012, and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidencies of the alliance.
Nava Vazquez expressed his belief that PAN would come out of internal elections held on the following 4 and 5 December in which his followers, strengthened, will be elected.
“This is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for the present time, intended for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
The President of the PAN said that the dialogue is behind him 71 years, and therefore, we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we are extracting and strengthening us - he has added.
He said that the committee could decide without discussion the best chair or chair he deserves for the next three years, so he would hand over the staff of the committee to identify.
“I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, and I am proud to give the President’s office to any of those five who are proud to the President’s office.
He foretold that the rise that the party had recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future climates, although not yet the time to think for 2012.
The Governor Gabina Cué needs to be accompanied in this task.
In this context, he pointed out that these three governments, having roots in the Oaxation, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be subject to observation throughout the country, since they are included in many expectations and desires, and I am sure that Gabino will reach these expectations.
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón side of PRI (Partido Revolutionaryario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institution Party, I know.) because of his speeches within four years, César Nava called on the members of PRI to think about the six-year periods of former Presidents Ernesta Zedilla and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the government of Fox and Claderón, they should start defending them from coming out of their shells, they would testify.
He said that the Federal Executive Chief has the right to express himself as he did during his speech in the National Auditory, since there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to promote students without evidence
If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, please let your senators know and insist that this law be approved, the US president tweets on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilisation in support of Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
“If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, please let your senators know and insist that this law be approved by Obama.
His short report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more extensive document that calls on the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on this law is approaching.
“If it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now is the moment to let your opinion be heard, it points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block approval of any law unless an extension of the tax from the Bush era and government funding is approved.
Such blocking, which was notified by letter signed by 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote on the law of Dream Act and on other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, entitled START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of Dream Act and other proposals, the President's spokesperson expressed his belief that once the fiscal theme is resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects will be possible.
“I believe there is still plenty of time left -
“We all agree that we need to solve the issue of taxes before the end of the year -
I believe that we can reach an agreement in this matter at some point, and then we can plan the order of other things - he said.
The democratic leader of the Harry Reid Senate announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a vote on the conclusion of the discussion, concerning the Dream Act law, so that the proposal for the legalisation of students without evidence could be voted in the Senate from the next quarter, although more likely is next week.
The Senatorial approval of Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream - would legalize about 800 000 young people who have reached the United States before they were 16 years old, lived in the country over the last five years and were admitted to an institution of higher education or army.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve, so that several Republicans need help, so that the organisation of their supporters is conducting intensive agitators to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, most of whom Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebrasky expressed his support for this law as a vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to obtain several Republicans in case other Democrats choose to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators who are most negotiated with are Senators from Maine Olympia Snewová and Susan Colins, as well as the withdrawor of Florida George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they have said that they will not support him any more.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, hasn't expressed up yet.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning to another version, most analysts are going to face the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature, they put their finger in the wound -poner el dedo en la llag - translated - put your finger in the wound - is similar to the Czech - to hit the nail on the head - recoil.
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of the language was the prominence where participants presented the literary gala performance
“To sex in the language I understand, but... Frst to the wound? What is waiting for me?”, wrote writer Luis Valenzuelová, who was invited to start a second round of The pleasure of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a substitute (at another fair, they devoted to Sex in the round table, she explained).
The hair into the wound is brought to a close - she has presented a leading Argentine writer to the audience, mostly composed of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to hear this debate at the round table, the fashioned Marisol Schultz and the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayry Monterová and Luis Garcei Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel reads a text dedicated to Gonzal Celori, and which Schultz later called it a great story in which Luisa performed in the first person as a protagogue who, when looking for the knowledge of the ‘rana, goes from a doctor to a doctor who does not respond to it, although the mark of the same story is yes.
From the Infectologist, he leaves the conviction: “Perhapsy is not my strong suit, perhaps it will be my wound.”
Finally, after a frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained that the wound was not a scientific term, it was a psychoanalytic that would reveal this mystery: “The morning represents a really dilated and the symbolic scar is“
The protagogniist took a deep breath and concluded that, in the morning, she was able to learn only so much that she was really wide open and that there was no belief, but there was no belief that the pleasure and persecution in the language had to go hand together.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicoravujec Sergio Ramírez also came up with a pleasant story called the Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not appointed in the wound, but appears at one moment.
With the elements of magical realism, she talks about the famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who went far, or corrected the chastisement that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to speak to America, a great novel, in which from the beginning his own guides did not miss him, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes overcoming the overcoming captains.
“Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked us with a falsified testimony that was presented in the course as real, but in other ways, it was never possible to tell the story of America with such an image that even the study lacked. ”
However, he pointed out, “they are fools and liars who have bigger imaginations,” and just where they are famous for reality and a lie, where they no longer know what belongs to one group and to another, achieves the fictional literature of their peak.
Indeed, this calls it “cervantian tradition“
\"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have--
Following this, Mayra Monter stressed and commended the diversity of interpretations, which the invitation of the International Book Fair with its Besed Prst to the wound allowed.
Cuban-portoric writer showed her finger for the great wound of social violence that passes through her country - and shared by Latin America - and is the consequence of business disputes and drug sales.
“I think that good literature, good poetry, and good songs are a silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended,” she said, after saying that the reality of literature is communication and dimensioning a compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their “chemical response”,
In the evening he concluded the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance was also aggravated by the writer, who was led to this finger in the wound of the writer called the writer.
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and in control of the consciousness that overtakes dogmathism, it is forgotten that, for every attracting, there is little and for every denying it, there is also little yes.
“To be masters of our thoughts and reality we must color: and to color means to put a finger in the wound many times and to harass those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in caricatures, black and white, in fixed Indians and without colouring, and to bother also the authority that prefer this black and white world - they have made to support the sense of writing.
Romano goes to his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts in three defeats in the finale, experienced good and bad during careers, but he has already achieved three occasions on a decisive series.
In the distance of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finale, two different styles with their techniques, teams that have a significant difference in results between them.
Rubén Omar Romano accounted for three defeats in the finale, experienced both good and bad during careers, but he has already achieved three occasions on a decisive series, but until now he has left with the uncircumcised, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
Argentinec had to settle with the silver medal, remained a step behind the winner, and he played with the same team the following finals.
Santistic stratég got into his first finale in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had in his hands the Morelia Club, with which he based on a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then he went back to a decisive duel and thus lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna Club in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the Devils - from Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the \"Uzeners\" (the next nickname of the Deportivo Toluca Club - I know.) after 210 minutes of the game undecidedly 2-2, after a series of criminal shooting he got to the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but eventually his three players passed out of 11 steps and the team suffered a turnover of 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Black Devils - from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that he is the most important institution for him.
“I want to come out as a winner, I don’t want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I’m committed to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important,” said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
In live memory, he has the previous finale in which, as he confirms, he has learned much, “we have learned a lesson that, until the referee plays the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared for the event, as well as the players, because last time with two penaltes, we have already been prepared to celebrate, and I think that we have learned in this until the game is over, we cannot celebrate.”
It does not concern him that this series could decide in criminal shootings, believes its players: ‘You never try to get to a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option, and we need to be ready for it, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately, we have a bad move for us, perhaps because of the nervous or anxiety we felt when we were in our hands, but we lost it, that in us has left something behind, and hopefully, this time, we will not find something like it.’
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other one and taste the glory that the titles bring for the first time.
United States changes the rules for the sharing of visas
People will have to turn to the centre of the Service for visa applicants before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and waiting time will be reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the visa negotiations at the United States Embassy and consulate will change.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to turn to the centre of the Service for visa applicants (in short of English ASC) before interviewing the Consular Department.
The ASC staff shall collect biometric information from the applicant and shall be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages among which the following are calculated:
The total cost of issuing visas will be lower, no longer needs to be paid a fee for the agreement of the meetings, the second for processing the application and another for the delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 per tourist visa, $150 for visa cases (including temporary staff visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to undergo an interview with a consular officer, but only they will turn to the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and will be taken away from their fingerprints.
Given that biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Unit will spend less time here than in the past.
Also, those who will ask for a visa at the consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for $26.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The American Space Agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in searching for alien life.
The U.S. Aviation and Space National Authority (NASA) will notify the United States tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by experts on astrobiology, science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe, at a press conference in NASA, Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that she would represent a “seeing that will break the search for alien life”, which encouraged the speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are also other creatures living in unhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility of becoming intelligent creatures, such as humans, if they improve the conditions in which they live.
According to appearance, it is a microbe found on the bottom of the Lake Mono in Yosemist national park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered to be too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is rich in the arena.
In some way, the arena uses it to its life, and this is what makes it more likely that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no atmosphere on Earth.
According to astobiologists, if these organisms use in their metabolism of iron, it will be shown that ‘there is another, the second form of life different from the one we know.’
The Space Agency shall notify the actual range of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference will take part in a geobiologist Pamela Conrad, studying the possibility of life on Mars; biological Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with a perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón are born by the opposition block -
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of bipartiscism - declare.
The 60th parliamentary period was not yet opened when the opposition block was created in Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolucion Demortica, Czech - Strana Democratic Revolution - - I know. over.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech - Strana work - I know. over.), Convergence (English) (English) and Jesús Manuel Patrán Montalvem, who declared themselves independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of “bipartism” to Sněmovna.
Before the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo, they acted against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it is directed.
This reform, repeated, begins “bapartism” because it will now be two people from the same number of sides who will control Congress.
These four Members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only people who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by the party PAN (Partido Acción, Czech - National Action Party) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms were institutionally formed by a political marginality from the popudu of PRI (Partido Revolucionalario Institutional, Czech-Revolutionary Institution Party - and PAN.
He stated that they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI in the following days to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not have it, they would be subjected to these two parties again, thus ending the opposition coalition.
I look at it because we're out of any decision they don't even want to consider the opinion of others.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from the Convergence said that the PRD, PT and Patrán are in agreement, and thus will form a pluralite group.
It is not possible to allow, continued, that Congress after being monopolous, was now “a dual“
Aspiring reform of the law is not to be an endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, on the part of PT, explained that the Congress has now become a two - in opposition to PAN and PRI.
“Only one party controlled it, and today two of them share it.
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the Member to give him a seat at the table.
\"For the five Members who are likely to be nine, but right now they see us in five, they don't stay behind, everyone in another fact, we are united to find a place at the table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed to, we are standing outside, and we disagree with this reform.\"
Another 200 000 pesos for the provider is issued.
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check discussed by the owner of the company supplying electromaterial.
Another check for something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent by the council to Loreno Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This is the sum paid in this second half-year of owner of the company supplying electromaterials will rise to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the city's transparency website, this last check of 9258447 was sent on November 16, this year, it was issued on a turnover of 200.144,56 pesos, and as its subject, it was described, ‘the compensation of unsettled payments’,
The commander Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was followed by the National Review Office for sale at high prices, another price.
What has not been said is the total cost that the city council owes her yet, and how many checks are still being sent to Camach Palazuelos.
“It has not been purchased now, it is only paid to what we owe it, as well as to other suppliers,” he said in one interview.
The last checks appeared on the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this businessman has not yet been published in the Government Paper, as he gives the law in the case of companies audited by the National Review Office in order to avoid their use of other administrative authorities, the cashier assured that the service of the city's contractor did not use it again.
in the previous time, after 25 July, he published a diary of the Noroses revision of the checks issued by the councillors to its suppliers, which revealed that during the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel Lópeze Sáncheze, more than 10 million pesos paid the town of Camach Palazuelos through 42 checks.
This also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she filed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor state of the town of Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of foreign tourists to the depths of the Sánchez Taboada beach, the tourist sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to the area and places which are in bad shape and do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubi, President of the Association of Traders of the Zone of Adrad, reminded that they repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of destination and the bad what tourists find here to replace with new activities or routes.
He said that the wrong state of the streets and walkers are working on tourists who are going through here and seeing a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Polices don’t know what it’s like to close on one day a business, and they have no idea of the market that they escape, otherwise they wouldn’t discuss these matters for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
The Council will have to take over responsibility and avoid such a repeating effect, it will have to take care of preventive maintenance, not just correct existing failures, to express itself.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, for even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its city maintenance strategy -
There are other places that look carelessly and sorry, which have noticed, such as the Mazatlian Emblem and El Venadito (monusion, statue of deer - recognized.)
“In today’s time for tourists to come, it is not only important to promote, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city flying the cleanness of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out,” he said.
“There was no need for attention, and this fact emphasises something that is well-known to all, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the council, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and well in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a subtatist Tourist Promuse, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is inseparable because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will be necessary first to make sure that we lose these places and so that we can put them in the list that we have for the promotion of this destination.
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dałalos, President CCE, would like the Members to take great responsibility by following an example in finding a better Sinaloy, in various challenges facing the state.
Parliamentary period of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State exectative calls for the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is being thrown down in the bushes and faces great problems.
From yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI MEPs, 13 from PAN, three from Partyido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRDs, one of the PTs, one of the Convergence and the last of the PVEMs, including a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, commitment to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that they will not repeat the same party and paternalists.
Eduardo Dałáos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and follow an example on the way for a better Sinaloa in various challenges facing them.
“We expect Members to exercise their rights, without agreements between the parties, because they are usually taking measures to promote their own interests and they are the criminal guides of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.
Therefore, he talked about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overflow to shift the rulings forward in order.
“We want them to do decent work and are primarily committed to society and sectors, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloy who gave them their voice in previous elections of trust,”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Isle hotel association, expressed that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in an effort to reach economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth in order to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage the creation of jobs in a certain way -
As far as tourism is concerned, he asked that new legislators give him greater weight in the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
“I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which, in addition, is directly competing with agriculture,
In addition, in order to provide means for starting tourism projects, Congress should help to deliver the state in security and help with the alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings.
The dolls, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the list of children's wishes in the Coronad Valenzuel family.
For their parents, the coming holiday of the Three kings will be difficult to fulfill their ideas, as their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Issaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will grant them toys and clothes that they desire so much.
Family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since father doesn't have a permanent job.
“We sometimes have it difficult because our husband is not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I get out with the ‘plebeans’ on the street selling on the street” said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wishes a doll or a bike while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Miss Barbie.
As for the 10-year-old José Alfreda, he would like to have some time-monster - a car, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesúse would like to wear Cayetana in size for one year.
\"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I would like this monster car', but I said to him we'll see the son 'cause it was very expensive - he remembers the sadness of Cayetan.
For older children who were in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, which is 11, has a size of 12, a 10-year-old Isaac size 10, whereas eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
José Juan's 14-year-old lacks sneakers so he could use a pair of five and a half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can take part in the campaign -The three Kings are looking for - and at the reception of the Nureste daily will bring you a gift or money in cash.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
The ten inspections were carried out in Estria, Wednesday, as part of the net disposal for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen have been arrested and face various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
“Comparedly 750 bays of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashis, money and equipment that served for production were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, the spokesperson of the police in Quebec.
There were 11 men and three women arrested in total, both of which the chiefs of this entire network, two of Sherbrook's men.
Arrested persons must have gone to the Sherbrook Justice Palace after they were arrested.
They could face the charges of Indian hemp production, his holding with the aim of trading with him, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections followed by a long-term investigation which lasted almost a year.
“This was the information that we received from the public and which enabled us to come to these arrests,” said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers to investigate the city of Estria State Police of Quebec, the State Police Department in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal for a system of conservatives who, according to government, should regulate the ship's problem with illegal immigrants, will be clearly overstuffed, while all three opposition parties on the centre have told them that they can't support it.
“I'm leaning on the Charter, ” he says.
“I am standing by the side of the side that built the shed under your feet,” said the chief of liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the du causus.
The liberals insist that the draft law, as proposed, is the law that would allow any person from the ship to be held for up to one year, identified as a ship carried by illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
Chief of thequebeck Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill's proposal because he was headed towards the wrong goal.
“We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do,” said M. Duceppe.
The NPD criticism on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, refused criticisms who wanted her party not to be strong enough in terms of illegal immigration.
“Neo-democracy agrees that we should take action against illegal immigrants’ leaders and that is what we consider to be part of another bill, C-35” said Mrs Chow.
“We do not support the proposal for a law of conservatives because it is in favour of refugees and putting children into prison for at least one year,” Mrs. Chow explained.
Minister for Immigration Jason Kenneth accused the opposition party.
“The Canadians report to the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that can be taken upon the torture and treat it like they are with some kind of foot-and-mouth disease.
They expect Canada to take consistent action, reacted to Minister Kenney.
The government has not voted in favour of its draft law, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative said to the QMI that the government would demand a vote, that any Member who opposed them would respond to his position in front of his voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement , the possible creation of a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and collusion, many observers continue to require the creation of a public investigation committee for the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, aims to prevent this idea from falling into oblivion: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Investigation from New York on January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why we surprised the Tuesday notice by one of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Police Service Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary for the public security critic, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as a ‘circumvent made out of the hat’ - a-amatorial solution that was dried on his knees -
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
“You will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we report it.”
-We are aware of this problem -
For president CSQ, Réjeana Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a public hearing.
\"So Mr. Charest insists that he does not want to create this investigation committee, and people think, like you and I, that he hides something, he explains.
The only way to achieve the creation of an investigation committee is Jean Charesta, which explains the case by Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute of Education of High Government officials.
In order to be able to come out of this blind alley, he suggested Quebekau to grant special mandate to the General Inspector so that he could investigate collusion and corruption.
We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Inspector - to decide.
It also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as Commissioners who allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of Charest's government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code so that it is better adapted for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on Agent Marteau (Cladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the caselaw of this kind of investigation is not exclusive.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments associated with this file.
During the operation of Jaro 2001, which had hit a group of bikers, although the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottowa then made changes in the Gang Law.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water flows came under strict control due to strong precipitation that fell from Tuesday in several regions of the province.
In the middle of the afternoon in Shawinigan, Maurice, there was a land meeting.
Two houses were pre-vacuated.
In the evening, there was another land set in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudère.
The road's down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit strong precipitation, i.e. it ran from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 other millimetres was not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north river and the Outaouais valley have been hit most.
There could be a total of up to 100 millimeters down there.
If we count these precipitations with the campaign snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of flooding in some water flows.
Quebek's rescue service reported a warning on Wednesday evening from the dangers of the river Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
Rivers north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, Lotbinière, became subject to flood emergency and continuous inspection.
In the area of de Lanaudère, there was a strong decline in the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a visible rain bridge was removed from the strong rains.
Two residues had to be pre-vacuated.
In Outauouais the discharge of some lakes from the banks caused the closure of certain routes, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefrac.
The rescue service has an emergency and takes care of the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a safety advisor.
The Quebeck Centre for the Prediction of the flood gave a warning in the middle of a warning against strong floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partially bluffing.
Quebeck radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards (RTV) due to controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians and, as well as for gross expression during the broadcast.
The Board for Radio and TV broadcasting considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained non-exclusive information on social assistance and the inappropriate negative selection of the Haitians of gross expression, which did not correspond to the broadcast during the day.
The Council also concluded that the suicide discussion, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Radio and TV Board received several complaints regarding comments made during the transmission, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the common front of beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts on the broadcast were inseparable.
Drivers must submit reliable information, not false.
As far as suicide is concerned, the moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the Commission members concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide cannot be understood as solving the problems of everyday life.
The Commission considers that the disputed episodes of broadcasting-Dupont's lunch reports have encountered a delicate topic in a impartial and appropriate manner -
There was no objection against him.
The last dispute was on a statement following an earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort thus entered a media shootout that caused many reactions.
He said that he had not sent any gift to help the Haitian because we cannot know for sure that the needers would actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments have not been incorrect, but that their cumulative effect creates an incredibly negative picture of the Haitians.
- I have already rescheduled my three-day respite of the matter -
\"My file has been intact for one and a half years,\" said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcasts have cooperated beyond their duties;
For a station which, inter alia, will have to notify these decisions once during the main transmission within three days, are the minimum consequences.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The municipality of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special course.
The Atlet, which emerges in the \"sanda\" (ung-fu-ful content, in the Kickbox and the Thai box enters the dads and ringes of the world and looking for new challenges.
“I started with martial arts such as kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explaining Zemmal, who lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals,
In my case, I'm looking for games a little everywhere, because for those who don't like playing on a country that appears in combat sports, there's a rare competition in North America.
Recently this person who works as a security guard and as an assistant to UPS just added his opponents bad news when he won two gold medals at World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won the category of kickbox full content and Thai box,” he said.
I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in the San Shou -
“They were invited by opponents who ended up with the first four at the last World Championships in each category -
I won a bronze in Toronto in 2009
In 2005, I ended the eighth year in Vietnam.
In 2007, I ended up in a tournament in the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished the third, added -
“The interesting thing is that in every competition I have made some progress, ” he says.
- At this rate I will be the first one or the ecclesiastes -
‘shou-or-sanda’ is a discipline originating in China, where the punches are grown and feet, as well as throwing on the ground, allowed.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rare in the ring.
The most famous boxer, from this form of struggle, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal has to keep in his career only one result, he confirms his participation in the Superturnaji-King of Sanda - Super Bowl in kung-fu.
In China, this competition is the highest and most prestigious, explains the sympathoic guy -
-It's kind of equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand) -
It was a great experience.
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the final.
- The one who defeated me was a real pro, analyzed--
‘There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)’
The following categories shall be used in the category finals:
“After that, the winners of each category are to be crowned by one champion, King kung-fu,
450 million without public competition
Hydro-Quebec agreed on a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering on the Eastern-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this casino, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, the SM Group and Axor, which received the most significant contract, a contract to manage the project in total amounting to $295 million without competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie gérance, was authorised in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec, to entrust its responsibility in the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortia-Énergie géerance received a Luke contract without any publication of the competition.
For Quebec, the complaint against the consortium of undertakings before us is putting in place a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and calling for price increases.
“This is a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition”
“This means that people, no longer secretly do post office agreements, are already making them open today,” said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at the press conference.
Something earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says he has a hard time carrying on how public interest can be sold this way.
Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said in the afternoon, insisting that this colulsion contract would be possible.
“I have my own journey,” she gloomed and claimed that the PQ was non-poorative - and lacked accuracy -
She said that - that would be the least - that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
These are usually allies, limited in time, which will allow two or more companies to gather their mutual experts in order to respond to the call for offers for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of the work.
Construction is already running and must be broken down until 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to admit that the formula of the consortium is no longer an exception in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the formula of the consortium in the field of engineering consultancy is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly at the speed of the business register ofquebet companies, this will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, with some appear to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; we call CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, and this is Dessau.
As regards the Energie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau especially underlined the fact that la Baie James' merger is a typical special dynamic of labour force and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s.
The main patron of the project Eastmain, the Réal Laporte, from the Energy Society Baie James (SEBJ), provided an explanation that forces us to take the edge over the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
-If you are going to a public competition and if there are few participants in the competition offering offers, your offered prices can be higher -
‘You have two options: i.e. you will gather people who are in that contract as participants of the competition, and that you will say: ‘Let us conclude an agreement with satisfaction and good price.’
But the main idea is that the price is not valid, but the competence of people is confirmed by Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie géerance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for over 50 000 dollars received by the Party of Quebec.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following verification of Le Devoir, 109 contracts for engineering advice concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin summarized 22 contracts, of which Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in the “Énergie géerance”
All contracts have been closed.
A total of 449 783 344 dollars, including a contract with the Énergie gérance for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Group) are great friends of the Quebeu Liberal Party.
Minister Normandeau released a report that the PQ was also linked to companies that fund it, before it specified that it was more of its management staff.
The corresponding consumption barometer - green - the label does not encourage confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development players, but also in the non-participating, brands and environmental certificates, to follow in product selection.
The worst part is that, although we are purchasing in a media space that urges us and urges us to consume socially responsible, this media universe tells us that there is a lack of credible information, the failure to meet the obligations that qualify even as a brake for its commitment, says Barěmètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption has increased in 2010 so called socially responsible products, the people of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, do not believe them much
Two thirds of us actually say that they don't believe in company promises concerning the environment, simply because the green advertising of the company is an instrument for measuring that the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke has developed.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates, which are attached to such fair products, but also to the credibility of products and brands that are referred to as ecologically responsible, says Barometers.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious only 14.6% of the people of Quebec.
However, the information on the corresponding consumption appears to be the prime priority for stimulating this site's consumption that is now almost third of the quebean consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and questionable nature of information would reduce the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified after the higher price of these products.
Finally, the third population of Quebekusus builds untrustfully on the reported data on the products or ‘green’ services that we seek to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and especially change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
The entire 61% of them favoured purchases of traders from their district and preferred to buy food, grown in their region, reports Baromètre.
More - green - and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québek likes to present himself as king of recycling which seeks the least environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained outside their vehicle, says Baromètre: in 2010, nearly 28% of the people of Quebec said that they use public transport or recommend using a car to drive at least two persons, in order to protect nature.
Walk and bike also supported 39.1% of those participants in this extensive behaviour survey who used this cliché.
State loan to purchase of the cinema eXcentris complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema eXcentris complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation but only to the amount of the loan.
The Developper Society -Angus et le Parallèle, which sought a gift of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to purchase a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent's taboo and which demonstrated its mission as a lover of film art, did not show what she requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation but under its own conditions.
More than expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, which would have been lower, some would have been the original expectations that could have set the basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with resources originating in the state.
The first action plan and the demand for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan were sent by the Minister St-Pierre President of the Society for Enterprise Development in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opposition came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to answer.
However, it appears that the hypothesease of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Let us remind you that the association of cinema owners and cinematographic centers in Quebec has come against the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, stating that the Minister of Culture does not have to finance a project relating to real estate when it did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants required essential economic support.
Daniel Langlois, owner, got into his cinema within ten years of film art after he financed the construction of the complex itself, which could have been the reason to change the state’s financial board.
The lack of halls for independent films is perverse in Montréal, and eXcentris could get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccharini in his forehead, directs a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will last $700 000 to push acquisitions.
Since spring 2009, the only of three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on February 27, next year and present the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccharini didn't remind Le Devoir and so he ignored himself, he and his group think of the designs to reduce that he's doing.
Lifted tires to Canada as a whole...
The new U.S. diplomatic springs, mentioned in the knowledge of WikiLeaks, reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of underestimation to the Canadians, but the same blow reflects their sense of superiority to Canada.
The American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voters lie at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009.
The four new reports between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday, which were published in public church, also provide sensitive details to each other, under the skin.
Communication with the date of September 22, 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, states in detail what point the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
To the great wonder of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives some explanation to this situation.
“The Caadian complex of less valuableity, almost stuck, mentions perhaps political leaders to talk about internal stakes rather than to realize that these elections also concern the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade campaign)”, writes.
“So the countries in question are“ closed,“ literally an elephant in these elections: all the conscious, but potentially too threatening to talk about them.”
The ambassador understands this, deafening silence, less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the party or even better chief of the Party to manage these important relations should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to the elections”
Other comments of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Brees, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your path will help ensure that the government remains in the vote on trust at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget that Canada will publicly acknowledge its first deficit for more than ten years, because of the recovery plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars, says M. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone Parliament's preliminary meeting so that the coalitions could not be defeated and that the opposition parties would mention their survival with the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington on the increasingly negative picture that the United States cast dramatic series on the CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the transmission of Borders, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which it can be observed not too charming links to Maher Arar,-No-Fly-List, or also to kidnappings for violent interviews with the CIA.
Another report suggests that during their first bilateral meeting of Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánama.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the principle, if applicable from the case-
At the end of the meeting, he wrote here, “he made some paper concerning Omar Khadr, 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, state secrets,
“The secret accepted that the file revised“
Finally, let us know that the person involved in WikiLeaks is sweating.
Tom Flanagan, former adviser to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of the CBC that a person responsible for this massive escape should be “destructed” -
And Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World lighting recovery plan
Yesterday, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries in Cancún with a view to achieving reduction of greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of further restrictions, which should be achieved for stabilising the planet's climate from now on to 2020.
This ambitious plan is located at the stage of large specific projects which the UN wants to promote in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult commitments to reduce on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the proposed plan yesterday, if the heated bulbs that monopolize even more than 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace fluocompact light bulbs or, even better, bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or LED) in English, a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions on the planet created by lighting would be removed.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of emissions from the car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, between Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow the decline in global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be deducted from this balance of 5 Gt to reach a 2nd degree climate heating stabilization by 2020 so that it can be excluded that it will not get out of control.
In hot bulbs, 95% of the energy is distributed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluocompact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs will last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
New DEL light bulbs, which said that this week in Philips production, were allegedly involved in the UN study - are expected to take 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, which gives us the idea of a possible arrangement with a refund plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostants and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations with fluompact bulbs because they contain mercury and they need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, as manufacturers would set up collection.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompackic light bulb, but rather a heat coal plant, which release many mercury needed to produce the promrrhage electricity in hot bulbs.
Only in the United States give these headquarters 25 000 tons of mercury a year.
The report also presents in detail profits that each country would benefit from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions a year for electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 heat plants, which would cost 2.5 billion.
The coast of elephants is patiently awaiting the results of the election results.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Coast of elephants after the expiry of the time limits laid down.
The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent election committee to complete its work and immediately notify its preliminary results, stressed the UN spokesperson's spokesperson,
‘He asks all parties in the Coast of Slavovina and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the notification of the evidence results are made.’
Despite the pressures developed by certain foreign governments, the election commission had reached the longest date - Wednesday midnight - without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's repentance.
About 40 minutes before the end of the term of President CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission continues to work - so that it can report the results.
On Wednesday, there have been challenges throughout the world to finalize the name of the second round winner between Laurent Gbagbo and the member of the opposition to Alaska Ouattar.
But the camp Gbagbo relys on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council for the ‘underwater’ - vote in the north, which the former rebels of the New Army (FN) are preparing since the failed state coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in the Synergy Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters who practiced the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have advised President of the Coast of the elephant to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaint given by Gbagbo.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is governed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally from President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demented any connection with former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of the results as “an unacceptable” - and asked Gbagb to respect them, but did not go so far as to require victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he suffered loss and that he would lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election committee from sending the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was considered coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two half for years.
The United Nations pointed out at the centre of the political faction of the Coast of elephants that it might be carried out responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended up in the first round on 31 October, as winner with 38% of the votes against Alassana Ouattar, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment rate in France, as stated by the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stablely at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by ISEE’s interim deviation correction data.
The number of unemployed has stood at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in metropolitan areas and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether they are looking for or not.
The current situation of young people on the labour market has yet to take place with a new increase in unemployment rates reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, the words according to the International Labour Office were 637 000 young people aged between 15 and 24.
As regards seniors, these have been reported in metropolitan France with a moderate increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months as well as in the year), this is 482 000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 has benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Inse has no longer published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after the field on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put in custody
Alexander Guérini, 53 years old, one of the chiefs of the waste processing companies and the brother of the PS Administrative Board of Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the course of the investigation of public procurement, allegedly obtained.
Alexander Guérini was charged with abuse of the property of the company, abuse of public funds and public property, concealing, providing bribes, taking bribes for the purposes of affecting the office and holding the shooting, reports his attorney.
“Alexandre Guérini is wary and insists that the judge understands all the questions he intends to ask him and not any misdemeanors.”
“It is easy to pursue it for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them,” said AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said by means of his lawyers that he sent the judges a short message before he was questioned to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapez, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to ensure the functioning of the dump that he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the distillation of funds related to their operation, Mr Simon has never known anything about this.
On this matter Daniel Pinna, former director-in-chief of Auuganne's services, was accused at the centre of abuse of public funds and compost, and left him free, under the judicial supervision of the prohibition of contacting the whole matter, the protagonists.
“My client has been able to explain to him all the facts that are being applied to him,”
“The investigating judge looks at it and leaves it free,” said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
The other four persons were charged and released for freedom at night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with the fact that they were under judicial supervision for two of them, declared a state attorney Michel Rafin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with elegant Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for taking bribes to influence the Office and for passive corruption.
Two activists from the agglomeration Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringier are accused, one forcision and abuse of the assets of the company - the second pro-complot in the abuse of public funds -
Finally, the business partner of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with securing the abuse of the assets of the company.
Among those who have been confronted with Mr Guérinim, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been accused in the parallel case of fraudulent public contracts concerning Korsika.
The investigators suspect his company that they helped to fight money from extensive gangsterism.
The investigation is conducted under several open court investigations against X in April 2009 subsequently after the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From sources of a close investigation, the search is focused in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the dump in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille community (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace overcame Syria's mediators
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotildy Reiss' work, a young research worker arrested in Iran because of the “sampling” - united his views in France, conducted diplomacy into a battle emergency and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this was carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received by WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to Americans, and went so far that he gave them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian prisoner in France, and a search for American justice for the sub-determination of material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they are subject to the sharp light of the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredited the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotildy Reiss.
He didn't really do anything for it.
The Diplomatic telegram, signed on 12 August 2009 in Paris, has titles: -Iran:French comments on how to solve in the event of a hostage -
A consultant from the Elysey Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Central East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of American diplomat Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They recommend the Americans to do so as to be prepared back into the country by their own nationals of violence held in Iran.
“Be noiseful,” they say, “you must constantly express, in the media, the fundamental rights of man, the involuntary - of every liberation -
It is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in an easy way, sensitive to its image.
“Do the more, the more they ask you to stop doing this,”
Because there has been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, “those will solve nothing,” says the Iranians, “the masters on evasive maneuvers.”
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is a ‘Iranian family tactics: taking hostages for ‘political blackmail’ purposes.
It states that the exemption of Klotildy Reiss (which will occur on 16 August, on the day on which it will be granted the refuge of the French embassy) is requested to pay a high financial amount to the Iranians (cauce EUR 230 000).
And they will announce that the Elysian Palace is anti-consumptioning hostage cases, a phenomenon that will “cut off”--
In the future, Iranians could arrest some 1,800 other French living in Iran - reports.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still being blocked in Iran.
The information is spread: Iranec Majid Kakavand, which the United States declare to have been fired for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released free of charge in Paris on the basis of a ruling by a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, following the illegal Iranian network to obtain the material intended for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majida Khakavanda with the bad news.
France's made a deal?
Release Iran for the release of young French?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that it is not.
The Elysian Palace, as it states, was not only ‘staffed by this decision by a judge, but sought the opportunity to stand against it.
“The talks between the President’s Office and the Minister of Justice (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but the French government cannot change the decision of the court - noted.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the authority of the French intelligence service.
Adviser of the Elysey Palace diales the telephone number, hangs up the phone headphones and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in Paris buildings managed by Iran's embassy -
At the time of the detention of Klotildy Reiss in Iran, the Elysian Palace develops its efforts, negotiates, through communication and organised-outs, to the media to convince the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play a significant, and, in effect, the role of the ‘Medicator’
Americans observe this activity not without irony and say that handling carries its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evocates the media-blest - French official officials -
What is the peace of gratitude, expressed in relation to M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
In spite of their statement, French officials have recognised that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.
The document then deals with the reasons that made the Elysian Palace pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication is aimed at the validation of President Sarkozy's policy opening with Syria - is analysing.
The policy applied in 2008 was observed by many critical votes in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved;
By continuing the Syrian role, Paris is trying to “monstring Syria, what a boy can serve when playing a constructive role in the area”
The aim is also to suck the grain of an accident between Syria and Iran.
The U.S. embassy knows that from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier believed him: ‘We do not know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is.
But we thanked them,
‘This should at least bring confusion and inaccuracies between Iran’
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysey Palace.
In communiqué thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their active role in the relief of our country -
End online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called “Peciválský”, which will ban the adolescents playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, stated responsible government officials.
The draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask the company operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to those under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family.
“A lot of children play these games all night and then have school learning problems and are unable to lead a normal life during the day--
“We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said AFP Jo Rin, who led the minister, who has the bill of concern.
On-line games will be newly accessible from 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the law, to clarify.
The government also assumes that it will ask the company to limit their daily access to these games for young people, whose parents request it, will complement the responsible worker.
It also provides free software to those who request it to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “concerned” countries, and daily press brings various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an indisputable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November South Korea, she won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, face to face 58 other nations.
The 2018-2022 World Championship: Fifa will establish host countries.
Full anxiety due to suspicions of corruption is established by the Executive Committee of the Fif on Thursday of the host country of World Cup in 2018 and 2022, the selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where fighting for influence and lobbying risk making technical criteria more precise.
The issue is sure, the Royal Fifa competition in 2018 will take place in Europe , the traditional bare of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgie).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping that it will be able to conquer the new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the premier on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be committed to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
A list of the personalities involved in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leader of the government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidan, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political stakes of the world.
The negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will take up to the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish a hierarchy according to candidates.
According to the assessment report, Fifa's English, Spanish-portugal (2018) and American (2022), they contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the Executive Commission at an hour to vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to the suspension of two CE members / European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynold Theme et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the collage of the fossils, which had hosted the world championship only once in a year.
The BBC set up a crown on Monday when she sent out a document that was \"putting on the pin\", the Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fif unsatisfied and bring the English leader to trouble David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that led by his predecessors in Tony Blair's office, which he managed to obtain for the London organisation of Olympic Games in 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to bring England to its name a new gloss with the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because two Spanish-Portugals don't miss the coffins already prepared by stadiums, their well-being (The World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any recovery measures against the English and the doubts about the payment of Spain and Portugal are merely increasing the position of Russia, which was outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadens, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared a non-German competition in the preparation of the vote - in the words of the opposition to the English press charges against members of the CE (European Commission).
“We will throw mud after them, we will try to compromise them,” said Mr Poutin.
For 2022 they seem logical to be the United States with their significant 1994 experience.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of Fif's main sponsors, seems to have a great lead in front of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, made a beautiful project.
But these candidacy seem premature for both countries, which, together in 2002, have undergone a test -
Another threat: the 2026 World Championship of China, which Fif hotly wishes, made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who pulled the big ace out of the sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new countries in its expansion, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the chatal charges of TV (because of the time shift) paid by European countries, creating a momentum force for Fif.
Second mandate: obviousness (certificate)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand made it look important.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in any way.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The Mandade of the Elysean Palace calls someone else.
The current head of the State will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
But obviousness is not in a good agreement with a share in the secret associated with the Presidency's function.
It is therefore necessary to do as doubt remains.
One way or another.
In 2006, without wanting to believe this, friends of Jacques Chirac made demands that the third mandate should not be excluded.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that, at some point, he would decide in autumn 2011.
As he recalls before the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the two mandates was limited to a hot state.
Was it the official announcement of his candidate?
He wasn't far away from it.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year term of office to two.
It was just his submission, not his notification.
It's not the first time he reminds me of such meetings as the humorous tone of the presidential election.
In the worst case, or in the best case, you still have seven and a half years before you with me - it passed in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: ‘Don’t think I’m not considering the next stage -
His earlier statements will not be done by his candidate more than his previous day; he will not make him candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of the two truths.
A fast way to run to PS, on the one side.
But it's not the entrance to Segolène Royal's collage, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because his run-in in 2012, it is evident that many in PS want to arrange for battle formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, the right-wing voters would prefer the François Fillon candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44% according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and we are not discussing this issue with the UMP, they responded immediately and cautiously to the president of the government.
“If they believe possible defeat, they will not run” says Jean-Pierre Rafarin.
“Stable will believe that he can win - correct Alain Juppe, balanced with obviousity.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Council in the year had to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for the introduction from the crisis or, at least, to notify the suspension of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of a sovereign European debt obliges, the institution for issuing securities will no doubt be able to afford so much categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation today in European securities markets.
The political price would be higher in this case.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde's press conference, he gave tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of addressing the claims of the European States.
She didn't want to say if she thought that the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their purchase programme of the sovereign bonds.
“I am rewarding my consideration for my European partners...“.
In the evening before, in Brussels, in its hearing with the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, he did not show himself as a more ecclesiastical as regards his intentions and satisfied with the fact that he stated that the programme of purchasing state titles on the secondary market - continues - and that we will see how we will decide - during the meeting that takes place this Thursday.
Only certainty: Central European Bank will monitor its basic unchanged interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of bonds made by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost €1.35 billion in the last week.
And due to the inadvertentness of the contractors on the market yesterday, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the counterparties on the market for anti-cipation on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change in course.
If the operation of loans for more than three months has already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, this last designated bank shall be subject to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a duration from one week to three months.
The Ekonomic today expects this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine that it would change its programme in a significant way -
“If not, this would mean taking a risk of calling a short-term new tension,” says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank’s economy.
The progressive East announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to take over Norbert Bräms, the economy at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the public debt market intervention plan, the European Central Bank must maintain the volume of purchasing its bonds in order to reinvigorate the weak market - it attaches Norbert Bräms.
In view of the European banks' exposure to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no further choice than to maintain their presence on the market.
“It needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at any cost and act in such a way as to prevent the decommissioning of paid performances of the countries belonging to the most fragile ones,” said a major bonds manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly away, the States will be more concerned about it to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government has its back
After the beginning of the week for Italy’s worrying situation was a little slowed down, yesterday with the back-up rate of bonds interest for 10 years.
Returning to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the president of the Regions said that they heard Giulia Tremonti qualified the situation as “incorruptible”, and that he expected“ an unexpected weekend, which he later commented on.
In any event, on Tuesday, the derogation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) went up to 263 points, which caused some resolution in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right-hand hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself to be “not too busy,” rather than developing the markets - and possible disease originating in Ireland.
‘The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not Greece or Ireland,
“The bad news is that it is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, the economy in the Hudson Institute.
Of course, and insecurely, its problem is the lack of growth and indiscriminate fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts the state of risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission is calculating, the government deficit will represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (compared to 3.9% by the government) and 3.5% in 2012, instead of 2.7%).
From here on, a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
‘If necessary, new strict measures will need to be taken - will be valued by Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy has accepted the support of international institutions.
“The basic stones of its economy are well and its calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time, provided Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the International Monetary Fund Administrative Board under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product 2011, MRLs), the stabilisation efforts required in Italy are smaller than the efforts required by other countries - recorded by Pier Carlo Padoan, the main economy of the OCDE.
The issue of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face the proposal for distrust in the Chamber of Parliament and then after that they could start organising the elections with which it counts at the end of March.
This would open up a period, little suitable for the adoption of a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde once again stressed this in Paris' press conference yesterday: ‘I think that Europeans have demonstrated it on Sundays all day and night, are clearly very solid determination, commitment to defend their currency and their currency zone -
Although everything is relative, last night's recorded expansion concerning interest in European state bonds, it brought water to mills and central European banks.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Bureau announced that it could degrad a record of Portugal's debt, a goal most focused on various speculations.
“Because in May there is a lack of transparency and public policy, consisting mainly of banking systems, the economics of Exane BNP Paribas.
More so that the political time runs slower than the time of the market -
The knowledge of this disrupted context and the dangers that it hides intensifies the European countries' discussions to strengthen the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, the most concerned problem, and in the wider scale with their G20 counterparts, is developing very well.
And that, taking into account Eurogroup meetings and Ecofin group since the start of the next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is held today.
The programme is the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As regards the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, announced on Tuesday in Singapore a trip to Asia, with a view to informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this path to increase the funds, it prepares the additional land to achieve this goal.
The first issuance of FESF securities is expected to be next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support possible increase in mobilised funds by additional direct engagement in the FMI.
The countries concerned in the first instance, Portugal and Spain, are prepared to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at any cost, asking for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and, before deciding on structural reforms, necessary to regain their continued trust.
The capital participants in the European funds are finally talking about options, available to accelerate the process of normalising markets with sovereign bonds.
On its way to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came with a thought that it would not be enough to reach EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
The Economics of Barclays Capital, which is the very first plan of trade with European sovereign claims, considers that the addition of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, ‘administratively, in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
It exists: this is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is the euro 60 billion on this date.
The Council, which has all the chances of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and sport: 24 countries have an orange emergency.
Snow rations still cause problems in transport, especially on the roads of second classes in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four periods have since now an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and rain.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres les and la Vienne, joined the 20 periods which already have a announced orange emergency, 18 from Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, there are significant snow flows of problems in the north of la Gironde and the forest Charentes and the weakness of snow on How much-de-France.
Snow covers from 2 to 5 cm, places 7 to 10 cm, are expected in the periods concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The periods of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, How much-de-France and Limousin.
Snow sulphides are large enough to cause problems in transport and disrupt certain economic activities, predicting Méteo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods prohibited the passage of heavy freight transport - trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the second class road in Brittany is very difficult by police officers, and police recommend driving with their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of certain truckers has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are envisaged for restrictions on freight transport.
The Office, as a general rule, calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on roads and to adapt the nature of the vehicle.
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) has requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Airport and 10% on the Orly Airport due to expected snow flows.
DGAC recommends to passengers using air transport services, to contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport is closed to the south of London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the Il-de-France in full current, billions are running.
At least during the discussion.
We recall especially 23 billion on the Grand Paris Metro, which is supposed to build a company called Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the State shall notify the grant of EUR 4 billion.
A net theoretically, this is the amount which will then allow the SGP to use part of its double funding to apply to the contract.
Today we finally get to the first supplement.
The 2010 Accounting Act, which examines the National Assembly's Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms laid down to ensure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and an increase in the tax on the office in Il-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is, in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris.
It is calculated: ‘The amount of this interest is EUR 117 million per year;
The second is the reconstruction of the rate at the office which already exists in order to upgrade it to increase its yield and to affect the increase in Société du Grand Paris.
How much would it take?
Overkill.
It's not numbered in text.
We've got a long way to 4 billion.
“It is specified that these fiscal resources are linked to EUR 4 billion from capital subsidies, which will be mobilised by the State and incorporated into Société du Grand Paris according to the project, we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us in the SGP.
Since we have created revenue (tax, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then lose up to 4 billion, it explains here:
‘This will be incorporated into the budget and applied as necessary;
The SGP considers that 4 billions will be added until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which 4 billions promised are still inadvertent subscribers, riskes it calling a somewhat disturbing parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will be December 7th.
Mistake hackers and cassual extorts
WikiLeaks case is of two importance.
On the one hand, there is a apparent scandal, a scandal that appears to be a scandal in the face of hypocriticalism that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it refers to deep international changes and assumes the future of controlled regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, which is confirmed by the fact that each document drawn up by a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of print cuts.
“The extraordinary revelations of Americans about the way Berlusconi's sex life has been reported for months, everyone could have read in any newspaper (all except those two Berlusconi own), and the caricature profile of Kadafí has been a long time for cabaret artist the subject for sketches.
According to which secret documents can only be composed of reports already known, it is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookstore that deals with ezoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templách or Zednářích) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And that is not only because the author does not like to look for new information (and does not know where to look for reports of the non-existent), but because those who are concerned with the ophthalmism believe only what they already know and what they have already learned.
That's a success mechanism for Dan Brown.
The same applies to classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, a editor in Libération's paper), who considers only true what he admits.
Information about Berlusconi, which the US embassy sent to the State Department, was the same information that Newsweek published.
Why, then, did such a habit happen around the revelation of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, although embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of States can call or fly by plane to dinner together, they have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in representation, they have transformed themselves into a spy center.
Any viewer watching the investigation is very well aware that it is only from the licomerity that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly, the obligation of hypocriticalness is disgraced, and that bad light on American diplomacy is ingesting.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the strictest classified information of the world's most powerful country represents a hard blow, not insignificant, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his “contractors”.
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all the power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvellovo's prophecy has been shown since the possibility to control every move thanks to the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, used highway and so on, became a citizen of the complete victims of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even the tombs, with the most secret information, cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, it ceases to be a one-way control report and becomes a orbit.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker, elected as a citizen, can know all the secrets of power.
How can he maintain power that no longer has the opportunity to keep his own secret?
It is true that George Simmel has already said that the true secret is unobtrusive (and the unobtrusive secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is truly a mysterious secret because it is pulled out of public life; but it can reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were unobserved, it means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistake with Sarkozy or Merckel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of inherited power?
Clearly, in the future, States will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be equal to its publication on a poster that has been put on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely clear that with current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that it can be kept hidden on the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and joined one of its colleagues.
How can private and sensitive reports be kept in the future ?
I know that for this moment, the forecast belongs to science fiction and therefore is fantastic, but I must imagine government officials who carry out discreetly a formality after uncontrollable routes and carry only those reports that know confusion or rather hide rare information in the heel of shoes.
The information will be kept in unique copies of closed keys in drawers: a total attempt to spy on the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward now, that means reverse.
One century after wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet was rehabilitating a telegraph based on wires (telephonics).
Videotapes (analogics) have enabled cinema lovers to dream the film step by step, move it forward and turn it off and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now CD (number) allow only to jump after chapters, that means after macroporces.
By means of speedwurs, we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to vehicles carried by horses.
Last note.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was in the secret of the embassy.
Now they are ambassadors who request confidential information from the press.
Klima: how France hacked its promises for financing
A year after Copenhagen, it is time to try to respect the promises for quickly blocked funding (repeated financing with a fast start or early start), implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks have been exposed
In Copenhagen, the developed countries committed to providing $330 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (this is EUR 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU has drawn up a large essay to convince its partners about the reality of its commitment to finance fast start: a report specifying the shares of its Member States, a press conference, grand side event, distribution of brochures...
Invaluable and valued operations: developed countries and civil society would want all developed countries and civil society to do them the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010 it released EUR 2.2 billion, which brings it to the right path to comply with its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find things are much more complicated.
These funds are in line with Copenhagen’s ‘new and additional agreements’ to ensure that there is increased burdens without public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus in what is ‘new and additional’:
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses that reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered it a reference year 2009: international funding has been maintained and it adds 150 million to it for three years the title of financing fast start.
Other countries have selected similar references with annual payment terms or deadlines at the level of public development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the funding of all new projects - 2010 is new and additional -
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public assistance for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the overall aid amount of France towards developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease) to comply with its commitment to financing new and additional funding....
Another decisive element is distribution into gifts and loans.
There's no rule there yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that € 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ gifted.
Clearly, it is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be added to some investments that are profitable (in time it is the projects associated with reducing emissions, consisting in more efficient technologies), it is the mud to present one euro that we will get as equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments but as a loan price for the creditor country (i.e. equivalent interest rate).
But France can only give such a reason: ‘maintaining its commitment to EUR 420 million, it makes 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million) and 8.5% of the donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan in such a scale.
Germany requested 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other ones) comply with their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the total majority of the European Union gives €1 to the satisfaction of its promise, France will give only 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful ducking piece!
For the summary, in its financing, France is operating with double-checking: on the one hand with the development of the stock in time and on the other hand with real financial burden.
Although it is only €36.1 million, it is able to convince itself that it produces €420 million - new and additional - in connection with its promises.
The Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it seems to be Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The early funding chapter is only a small question, a relatively short period, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine like UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should notify the change in its way of managing the accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respecting its obligations and integrity and justice towards other European Union countries.
But above all, France should prevent the debate on deposits in long-term financing (other fundamental chapter currently discussed): we will not avoid the question of whether or not the way in which loans are settled.
France should change its position to become as progressive with these deposits as others.
So hope is that everyone will be included in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
Surprising announcements on the fast start of France and its vision of ‘additionality’, and the use of loans could lead to an increase in international confidence, which is necessary in order to allow further discussion.
An alarm about pesticides that will end up with children.
One day, a ten-year-old will end 81 different chemicals, according to one study published on this Wednesday, from the Association of Future generations (ex-Hating for the rights and conservation of future generations).
The Association notes that its results are of a significant statistical value, taking into account the low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic of the processed issue - bought commonly consumed food between July and September in four meals and one light meal as a light lunch for one child about ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as diabetes, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is crushing: 81 chemicals, 42 of which consists of carcinogenic substances, possibly or likely, and five substances are among clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive for glands with internal mixing (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted are not individually exceeded, in our research we see that reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is an intimidating society.
For breakfast butter and milk tea, they contain about ten rhesy with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as in about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, submitted studies as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including in France the prohibited functional means.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in lunch, where studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
In addition, milked meat bifts, canned tuna and even mushrooms and gums were dusted with pesticides and other chemicals.
In water from the tap analysis, they revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
Steak from salmon to dinner was “the richest one, with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to warm food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this contaminants cocktail is likely to be underestimated - results from a study.
The Ecological Europe-Green Association (EEE-LV) has proposed, in the face of an emergency, to establish a moratorium for the use of pesticides to stop the increase in civilizational diseases.
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) surveyed the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 in cereal.
