Europe's inflation has jumped due to food
Accelerated inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1% registered in October, according to the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast was only 3%, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian Emissions Banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the basic interest rate, with the reduction in raw materials prices and the decline in unemployment leading to an inflation spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below 2%, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must “reflation” so that it doesn’t have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 percent of the 15-year record; in Spain, it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The inflation in the euro area has risen upwards due to rising prices of food and energy.
The price of wheat increased by 88 percent, and the rate of soy has also reached the highest value since 1973.
In the same way, it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The price of oil in the world’s markets rose 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will drop from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months of inflation will remain around 3 to 4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double its interest rate in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement after the long-lasting stagnation at the beginning of December has increased significantly, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured 13% of support.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater commitment of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of support compared to the fifth support of the MFA.
MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entry into parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
There is one percent more supporters of both camps among certain party voters.
The public's view of the economy worsened due to the previous minimum - there has never been a ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
The family assesses the change in its material situation after the spring and summer prospects are now more pessimistic.
As for the next year, the larger part of the population counts with a further deterioration and only a tenth with improvements.
In December, 71 percent of those surveyed, the most of which is from all of Gallup’s research that the Prime Minister is doing his job badly rather than well.
Gyurcsany’s ferencies believe or believe 13% of those surveyed, while Viktor Orbán’s supporters share is 38%.
The Prime Minister does not believe 54 percent of Fidesz 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be addressed without changing the government.
While, after last October’s unrest, the government and the prime minister considered it 35 percent desirable, at present this share is only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the writing of new elections.
For interested in the referendum, it is clear that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that a referendum would certainly come, and another 20 percent said it would likely come.
In comparison, “Parliamentary elections held this Sunday” would surely involve only 55 per cent and another 15 per cent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be beyond doubt based on current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, medical fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, medical fees and hospital fees would refuse 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth of Tesco's dead.
Hypermarkets in the Budaörsian Trade Triangle maintained last year, an average 16% increase in price levels, with the difference that this year did not increase VAT.
Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas shopping basket of the Napi Gazdaság daily in the Budaörsian Trade Triangle increased by an average of 16% this year, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase in the price of over a thousand forints.
As food supermarket prices have already flown out in December, there was no so drastic pricelist in view of the previous high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could buy last year at a price of less than 9,000 forints will not buy for ten thousand.
The Daily Economy consumable basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest cost of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but they very much destroyed cruel breasts, nuts and also flour.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found kilogram bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of the two-litre Coca Cola in the return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the backup it cost the product only 257 forints.
This year, however, the Napi Gazdaság Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket increased by 15 per cent last year, while Tesco and Auchan were about 18 per cent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumer basket value, the difference was 12%, while the rise between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21%.
In the forints, there was an increase in the average of 1 480.
The average increase in prices last year was 1,206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last year.
It was this process that had broken down the trade, and the houses apparently failed to decide how large the price range for each product was to be determined, since they could not predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If a trader plans the speed of circulation of a given product poorly, he may lose significant profit due to the price range adjusted to the circulation intensity.)
Due to VAT last year, the increase in the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest was the price difference of all 844 forints.
This year the extreme difference did not show up, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest topped by 1,284 forints.
In comparison to the two Christmas seasons, price growth has been demonstrated, with daily goods being destroyed in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, among other things, does not absolutely confirm the Central Statistical Office’s data: it measured an increase in prices above 30 per cent in 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, it seems almost impossible, according to the Daily Economy consumer basket, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed, given the basis even in the worst case, the price growth hardly above 10 per cent.
The suppliers of flour seem to be in a stronger position than the suppliers of eggs, with drastic price increases being successful in international chains as well.
Hypermarkets in the Golden Triangle do not complain, they still report on a good year.
According to our experience, most customers are no longer interested in the price in three shops visited.
They buy everything in quantity, durable food takes on salaries.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets there were long queues at the checkouts, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, there is a lower turnover in rural areas, with more international chains complaining to research firms that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, the overload of the disease cessation staff do not help, according to the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, it is also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, the traumatic department of St. John's Hospital has been diagnosed with MRSA infection.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria found in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
By December 10, 1,094 hospital infections were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance caused by multi-resistant disease originators, according to Karolina Böröczová, the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistent disease originators have been registered in hospitals with certainty, and others are not known.
Almost two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is worn by a third of people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsil inflammation, skin infections, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be well treated.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive extent or inappropriately, they develop from bacteria that respond well to antibiotics, which are very resistant to antibiotics and which spread rapidly in non-responsible hospital conditions.
First of all, if the immune system is temporarily or permanently impaired in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients over the years, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as morning infection or blood poisoning - Sepsis.
According to the Chief Doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections belong to daily practice in hospitals.
“Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there,” Tibor Nyulasi said, “where the presence of the causer of the disease is not investigated.”
Resistant to antibiotics
“We isolate these patients, treat them in rubber gloves and mask, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients receiving to the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their body, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
Sample collection is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable for the prevention and spread of multi-resistant disease agents, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs significantly in hospitals and homes for seniors, hospitals taken by patients should control and MRSA carriers should immediately isolate.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this examination.
Most of the cases are revealed if the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, the primary epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also home guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to avoid drug resistance, but hospitals in all cases do not respect it.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the basic and outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina Böröczová.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads most often among patients through medical staff.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in hand washing and the use of gloves and masks, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals as well.
MRSA is transmitted by both cape infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
According to Karolina Böröcz, unfortunately, we can also see that in hospitals that are in an adverse material situation, saving on disinfectants, caregivers are few, and patients are much more likely to develop infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections can be shown to be less or further spread of the disease can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written an MRSA prevention programme, or a reduction in its occurrence.
As the program seems to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a decreasing tendency.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistent disease agents (including MRSA), or hospital infections caused by these disease agents, among their priorities.
Police captain who caused a fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of a police captain of the XXII district, which caused a fatal accident, is done.
It can be ruled out that a police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who, in the meantime, resigned from his office, would be controlled under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a spokesperson for the Supreme Public Prosecutor of the capital Attila Morvai said on Friday after the expert assessment of the case was completed.
The expert assessment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already concluded that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
The then director of the police department of the XXII district collided on Tuesday in Lajose Kossutha Street in XXII. district with his own passenger car while turning a fifty-year-old man who came in front of him while crossing the road outside the marked passage.
(The last-named fact that the pedestrian has passed outside of the clock, in other words, according to the rules of road traffic is not an easing circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After the transfer to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned from office and asked for a transfer to service, according to a police announcement, because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain from the beginning cooperated with the prosecutors of the investigation.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
The three credit frameworks agreement totalling €400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy were signed on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties previously entering into a credit agreement of €100 million, and the agreement now concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
A €150 million loan agreement is also used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for these purposes, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of 50 million euros, which the budget will use primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk about the 4th metro route at the meeting.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has negotiated with the EU the details of the metro financing, it will return to whether and how to modify the original contract.
This may happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects of €8.4 billion.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission shall be bound by EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of the whole of Europe turns to a previously neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the most expensive yet rapidly expensive EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European property shopping destination is now without a doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the mountains are the most in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, ancient cities Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties near Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, investors and the central part of the country, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will sooner or later be encouraged to shop in the area of the cheap city of Rusa.
The capital of Sofia is also a promise of attractive options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best track to turn into one of Europe’s most attractive golf paradises, becoming, alongside the summer and winter season, the destination of the journeys even in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already shopping in large, for example, around Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers come from England, but buyers from France, Belgium, Spain also come from Romania more and more often.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, near the Black Sea and in the ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
To divide foreign buyers of lez into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Planting people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or flimsy old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category are chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the first 10 German recreational destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium or long term.
The cost of real estate in the capital is continuous, as demand is getting stronger and stronger.
In Bulgaria, the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are the lowest, but over the last five years they have grown by 21% a year.
The increase in property prices significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor’s meetings will be closed on Tuesday, and after Wednesday’s official launch, the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are dealing with the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the period of reduction of emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a stormy debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not want to deal with exact numbers now, although it will adhere to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 due to the state of 1990.
The next big question of the conference is whether developed countries will also come to a reduction in emissions to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member Board of Directors, probably under the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
The Minister of Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain a leading role in the efforts to achieve global climate protection and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of adoption of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to up to 30 percent reduction if other developed areas of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibility and commitments corresponding to their possibilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had the target of a reduction of 5.2%, with 15 EU Member States committed to 8% at the time.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which will be our country's responsibility.
This is a big deal in Bali, as an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would have moved with certainty only in 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments set by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new emissions reduction system, the need for which, in its latest report, was also pointed out by the United Nations International Scientific Council on Climate Change - the IPCC, which is the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in emission reductions and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military forces publish recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing server that they are popularizing themselves with.
First, YouTube liked the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command in the Kandahar area and then sent to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
In this form, there have already been 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers on the internet and more than 75,000 people have looked at their channel.
The British Defense Ministry registered in the spring of 2007 as the Defenseheadquarters, and publishes recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and international peacekeeping units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Air forces have released videos according to their original intention for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good at familiarizing the general public with the real goal of the military presence abroad.
“The promotion published in this form compared to traditional TV recruitment ads is almost worth nothing,” said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert at the BBC, “but necessarily it also carries a certain political message, as it confirms in a special way the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.”
Americans made a game
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully modified censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, which, for example, also captures the death of soldiers: in some hypocritical, ‘official’ promotional films, officers are most likely to talk about losses, but there is no bloody form of struggle.
After all, many videos have been released on the internet from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, but the British army has only found them now.
Americans recruit a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of soldiers.
There will be Christmas at the Ministries with tombols and pags.
The Minister of Labour, Monika Lamperth, seems not to be sentient: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold a final work meeting for his colleagues, at which he will say goodbye to the taps and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries, the celebration will be with live music, elsewhere it will enchant officials with the Christmas atmosphere with a tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and the Swedish table - this is how the powerful are enjoying.
The state authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year’s most expensive Ministerial Christmas party will be held by the Ministry of Defense, but it does not expect its employees.
Children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts about Christmas orphans, family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort spends 25 million on the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) are tossing themselves out of the dome compared to other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from six hundred staff.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a turntable will also be drawn.
The Christmas of NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - there were concerts and dinners on the program.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: here the company securing the course of the tender, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the theatre Vigszínház.
MAG a.s. has not confirmed this information because we have failed to reach the relevant person.
No Clothing is necessary
The OIT building was hosted not only by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which was held instead of Christmas on 7 December by St. Lucie’s Ball.
However, OIT did not want money from him using his halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with a health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the [origo] question on the ball, evening dresses or suits were not mandatory at all.
Puritan parties are preparing health, labour and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not even officially invite colleagues to a Christmas party, but at the final work meeting.
A hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and tea, so that only 350 000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply drink at the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, which 436 employees expect, in its own large hall.
The Christmas party is dedicated to 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since Minister János Veres has been celebrating PM Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missed, the officiality will strengthen not only the Ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The agricultural resort hosts a New Year's reception on January 20, and the Ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in the castle of Vajdahunyadvár in the Municipal sadles and according to the Ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are intended for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, at which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with the short health of the minister and end with a small hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not host Christmas parties at all, [origo] told the relevant press department.
The award of the Christmas celebrations of the Environmental Ministry in the press department could not be announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Arts.
Sliding towards a giant strike
The Association of Trade Unions of the League, or the National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s timeless bet.
On Saturday, a protest public assembly will be held, on Monday - the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious interruptions in transport, as it will almost completely stop rail transport and within 13 hours employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet the National Union of Workers’ Councils with details of the joint Monday strike.
The LIGA-MOSZ betting committee will also be established, which will coordinate the Monday event.
On Saturday, a protest public assembly is held, and from Monday the unions joining the strike will stop working indefinitely unless there is an agreement with the government.
This means that the deadline for the termination of the strike has not been set, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committee will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Monday agenda of the Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted only in the late evening or night hours.
Due to Monday’s start-up strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: on the railway the work will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning a part of Budapest’s public transport and more than half of Volán’s companies may stop.
At the same time, half of the track will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call to the strike, whose list is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations have announced an indefinite strike, others have declared temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungarian State Railways (MAVs) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of Christmas holidays more and more people are travelling by rail.
According to the previous announcements, from the start of operation to 13 hours, BKV will strike, from 7 to 9 o'clock in the morning at Budapest Airport, the four-hour strike will be organized by the Union of Workers in the Energy Industry of LIGA, to the 2- or 2-hour stop work called on the Trade Union of Teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), belonging to the Trade Union Cooperation Forum (SSEF), holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and presents a new concept for the public debate.
The second requirement is that a new way of counting pensions should be introduced gradually from next year.
Third, in order to ensure that early retirement for the relevant employment sector can be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZSZ), falling under the Trade Union League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding Railway Branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the Jobbik Magyarországrt movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
In the case of the Hungarian Guard’s activities, the most political risk is that, by focusing on the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roman population of Hungary, violent ethnic conflicts can occur in a short time.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to aim at provoking such an action - the research institute adds.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the biggest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: “The public debate on the Romani issue has left public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could put up a political strategy on Roma-Hungarians.
It deepens the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, Hungarian Guard’s activities, according to the research institute, have largely spoiled Hungary’s image abroad, especially as regards the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity.
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which since autumn 2006 have been getting more and more publicity and vehemence, is that in Hungary, since summer 2007, several organizations have been created, which themselves are called associations - national domestic defences -
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly proclaim, even armed, the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, attacking the country, violating order), in addition to pointing to the inability of the police, the army, or the state,” he adds.
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts built on the opposition of society to politics and parties into civil clothes.
The emphasis of civilization and the form of society, therefore, in the case of these groups, is not only used to avoid the legal difficulties of judicial registration, but also is a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also a risk-increasing factor in neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, Hungarian cities in several neighbouring states have been pointing out as a potential source of danger, and ultranationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policy by appealing to the Hungarian Guard.
All of this can affect the political stability of the area,” he adds.
According to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
The activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard there are mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish a guard, with the aim of an organization being a “national domesticist”
In the past 17 years, however, the state has remained inactive and indifferent in Bulgaria, according to the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a turbulent discussion by the Bulgarian public.
As he further writes, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations that it will create its own cities on the sign of resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard’s activity so far shows similarities to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own domobrons, we can read in the risk warning drawn up by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhasz, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued each year and, if he finds something that might have an impact on the risk change, he informs public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk alert.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, free days are precisely determined by law, and it has already become a general practice that working days are shifting around holidays, which will wait less for us next year.
In the European Union and America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national holidays and working days.
The days of work are usually related to church holidays or to important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a working holiday - for the New Year already so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the revolution of 1848 and October 23, the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the establishment of the state, on May 1st work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember dead relatives and friends.
In addition, there are two-day holidays of Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become a practice of moving the working day in cases where we work only one day before or after a free holiday.
However, the price for the extended weekends is that we stay in the workplace and school on the previous Saturdays.
When the day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday, we have been working out, the Minister of Labour has been preparing for many years in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employees, public workers and public service persons.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or in view of their destination, they also work on the days of working peace.
This year there will be a change in the working order only around holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to experience, most people will take days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance - work - or thus take advantage of the saved holiday.
In the coming year, several of our holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so that the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holiday of work so that workers can stay home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26th April will be a working day so that it can be Friday 2nd May of the day of rest.
Next move is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, the place of Friday 24 will be worked.
The end of the year, however, will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays even though New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six repressive little things you can get your colleagues angry with.
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we will hardly notice anymore: all of this is “inspiring” every day in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves and unclear situations that can upset others, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
“I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department,” a colleague told you.
Is that why you missed the party?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, a case is solved by an apology.
Before there is a embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you can prepare for your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to prevent it.
Do you borrow something that isn’t yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you're loaded up for some type of writing, office need, or your phone, and they're not there.
Remember, you put a workbook on your desk yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or have you discovered your pen on the table of one of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Without permission, do not take anything from your colleagues, otherwise they will be rightly angry at you, that you are taking advantage of them in matters.
Don’t take out envelopes or adhesives from your office because it can be uncomfortable when you run out of time, and you’ll need them immediately.
Drts about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the spreading cleavages.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t hang on everyone’s noses about their private life.
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, don’t abuse their trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know it.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and call for severe headaches, you report your absence because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, think that your work, urgent tasks and work, which have a certain term, will have to be done for you by someone else.
Keep an eye on your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you’re not going to work, or that something can happen that you’ll have to stay home for, tell your colleagues and leaders not to be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Scratching, Hygienization, Phone
Have you been immersed in a job where you'll be cut off by a dirty colleague?
Wouldn't you want to be a witness to a phone conversation that'd be better off not hearing?
Do not disturb your coworkers by squeezing, singing, loud calls (hem above your head), nor by squeezing, constant cursing, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not being prevented from some project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If something isn’t in time or you’ve forgotten to send an important letter or message, don’t blame others for your oblivion!
Do not appeal to any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you have been wrong and someone paid for it, and correct the damage!
Ask yourself how you can put things right, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Warm and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear clothes for free time, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in ordinary clothes - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegantly!
If a person wants to meet, he ceases to be interesting.
Congestion in usual morning constipation.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of the violin, to which the electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes the pace and the previous tone color adds bass, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
At the station m2 is a song by the band Zagar called Wings of Love.
The home music life has not spoiled us with high-quality electronic pop for a long time.
Suddenly, however, the constipation looks quite different because you are listening to Zagar's new album.
The apparition of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, is slowly changing the overall image, and although there is once again in the fashion of garage rock with its grinding into the guitar, even domestic electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in the Five-Earth, and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until eventually - perhaps because two dudators do not fit into one spell - went their own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Töröka
His formations, beginning in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after the magazine Wan2 ranked their first album of 2002 as one of the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie almost the only domestic actors to determine developments that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are without a doubt - in the course - although, of course, no one asked them if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as it belonged: they made a new, better album.
The now released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths to them, although the name itself tries to create a legacy with the initial flights in the Five-Bedroom.
This is a single verse from the song of the old band Balázs Zsager.
A reference to ethericno, flying would be in place, but next to the etheric touch of this music, it has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of the time - a louder guitar, influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, was introduced at the premiere of the Millenaires Park.
The album was also produced by one real radio hit, thanks to the station Mr2 Petőfi, which lasted from morning to evening popular music, we began to get stuck in the melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers - Underground Divas -
So everything's fine.)
The hvg.hu portal concurred with Balázs Zsager.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question of how much is left of what you are playing is marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they say nothing, and this is how it can only be created for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can stem from a sincere internal need.
There is also an attitude in this spirit, as it is adopted, independently of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people who are 20 years old, but also older.
Much more they watch the transformation of light music around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how much of your music listens?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling that more and more people are going to attend our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen at concerts, where there is already a mutual influence, but it is hidden only in the insignificant changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if a person wants to suit the audience, from that moment on, he ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and has built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t actually go his way, regardless of the fact that we sometimes try to explain our music.
We are more team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, we couldn’t avoid comparing our work to the songs of Yonderboie, because some of us separated from his band and went a different way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the station Mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love came first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Have you consciously opened up to wider layers with more popular style?
B.Z.: We didn't plan to write a hit to sell the record.
That song is all about.
We thought of it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you pick the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir from the soloist's home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member congregation, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judith Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, was put together, which we then baptized on Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that what you were thinking about, or did the girls change something about her?
B.Zs.: For a long time, the song existed in an instrumental version, when the material came together on the record, we thought there was still something needed for this song.
Following the chords, he led the singer to join him.
On that day of the night, I sang a melody on him, which the girls later learned.
It all came out almost first and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course, it needed Wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don’t have solo (except Judah Jay), they don’t have their own role, they sing completely together, and they’re not louder than music, so music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They also stood on the stage in the back.
Is that intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing in the back was just because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to split solo roles is intentional.
Even that song is about forgetting a little about our ego, where it is, where it belongs, and to just let ourselves have those wings, the wings of love.
I wanted this euphoric state, which we felt when the song was born, to feel the rest.
hvg.hu: What was the most important thing to do?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, not even with one, heavier pieces occurred rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, then he slowly found his place in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: It's always changing by performing, and I've already released the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor risked billions of dollars of inferiority.
A defraudant.
This is what the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka, refers to.
Because of him, he came almost five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to deal with his colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
“He is mentally weaker,” his superiors, who sent the police to him, said.
However, according to Kerviel’s statement, which was brought by the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, it was a person who, at the end of last year, had profits of 1.6 billion euros from his trades.
The crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
However, this crisis had no impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and wagered it right.
At the end of the year, his profit increased to up to 1.6 billion euros.
“When I made the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t leave anything to himself.
Throughout the hearing, he admits that he faked records so that they didn't come to him.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange was interested in his trades.
The risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come to him?
Rather not.
“I thought it was just a simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank, it’s a satisfaction.”
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 just after he reached Lyon University.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never earn as much as others.
In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were watching me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development,” Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the arrival came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz’s shares, he earned half a billion euros in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll let you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the bosses knew everything or knew it.
“As long as I was earning money, my eyes were holding.”
But then came the wound at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to destroy it.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
I have only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who is not allowed is a broker who does not want anyone to look at him in his records.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Czech Government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could receive €14 billion in the coming years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion CZK will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovation business.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more efficient organisational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
20-year-old punishment for Nicaraguan ex-President confirmed by court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday confirmed a twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Aleman, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (no more than CZK 1.8 billion).
However, he was later released from prison and lived in a home prison on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 returns behind bars, it is not clear at the moment.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now matter to the prisoners whether they let Aliman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and accounts belonged in fact to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Aleman founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
They approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year he went through the ČSSD with the support of Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford to accept him.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on the distrust of the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The House of Deputies traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, passed the law in peace.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether or not someone likes it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
This is more media-thanks and therefore he pays much more attention in the media.
Guessing politicians is much more interesting to the public than rough numbers.
State budgets in past Social Democratic governments have suffered three disorders, which for 2008 is not able to resolve at once:
The first of these is a high proportion of the law of mandatory, so-called mandate spending, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year before the elections were approved by the silent-coalition - ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first failure.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively controlled.
However, the time bomb is a deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, obtain additional resources for investments, often headlessly issue bonds that disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts by selling mass shares of energy and other distribution networks that they have received from the state from privatization.
They no longer have this source.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through growth phases for several years, as well as the rest of the world, thus constantly boasting ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state was more and more indebted.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
It is a shame that falls primarily on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, in recent years have completely lost their weight to gigantic dimensions.
Even if part of the absurd populist expenditures approved this year before the elections have been abolished, if the retirement limit and pension reform are not shifted in the near future, then in fact any policy in this country will end, and whoever governs it will be mere office.
With a small exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolutionary one, but it can only suspend the printing of normal spending by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if past governments had failed to deal with what they could in the past ten years.
If we do not want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and give this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can issue only as much as it can obtain in taxes and fees, peace of mind to prepare other reform laws.
Only these will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have jointly decided to fight the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will come to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks are auctioning interest rates for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and another twenty-four will be made available to European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is intended to address the biggest economic difficulties, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” Bernard Baumohl, an economic Outlook Group consultant, wrote in a report.
“Coordinated actions by central banks have reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50%,” Baumohl said in a report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion losses.
“Central banks need to be really afraid of what might still follow when they decided to do so,” said Amro Kieran Daisy, the chief economist of ABN.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend wires to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into a recession with possible impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, a London interbank rate that is used to borrow money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual lending, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain have reduced their interest rates several times in the fall.
“This will have the same effect as the further decline in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting to Reuters.
Some analysts don’t think that the central banks’ move will contribute to the crisis because it doesn’t solve the underlying problem, and that’s the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' Debates Are Incredible
Global climate change is most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his views on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now come to an end at the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he stated that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which is a strange mixture of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
“The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems,” Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that her topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so involved with them.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, “almost I encounter only cartoons of my opinions.”
So now the interested parties can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate scientist, but that he had enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main conclusions of the book, he referred to the thesis that the climate is constantly changing, and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet of all scientists, that the consequences of these changes are not too large and serious, and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained, on the questions asked, that he was not opposed to “intelligible environmental protection, but to militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits.”
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver did not replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed a deadline and failed to replace an old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue a new card to them by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would go on the road after the New Year without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card was not changed mainly by those who no longer wanted to drive.
While the village reports a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of a driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are instigated with requests and interest in the exchange of a license this week has increased.
The Magistrate holds around 2,000 clients a day.
There are about half an hour waiting in the fronts.
In Prague, the driver’s license has not yet been exchanged by around 140,000 drivers.
It takes 20 days to issue a new card.
However, it is possible to apply for an issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who fail to exchange their license by the end of the year and drive on the road without a valid driver will face a penalty from January.
The guilty will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, a police officer can also deal with the offence by means of an agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information, he could get a fine from the town hall and a man who didn’t go anywhere.
He could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum thousand crown fines.
According to a spokesperson for the transport ministry, Karl Hanzelka, but ten thousand fines are not a threat to anyone.
A driver’s license is a proof that people can decide whether or not they want it.
It’s not a ID that everyone has to have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
It is enough to take it or send it by mail to the competent municipal office.
At the end of the year, licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court has reduced penalties to detectives associated with Berdych.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with a gang of David Berdych, will go to 13 and ten years in prison.
With definitive validity, the Prague Supreme Court ruled on this, which so reduced their punishments, one by one and the other by two years.
Initially, the detectives of the Prague Department for the fight against organised crime threatened 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision; it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is waiting for the first-time verdict.
However, in other processes he has already received penalties in total of over 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the Regional Court recognised, in particular, the participation of 19 people guilty of robberys, and today the Supreme Court dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have refused the investigation since the start, with the case being designed.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, after an agreement with Berdych, were handing information to the criminals from the police sources, covering individual robberys and helping gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave 30 per cent for this from the dandelion for Opava and Koňarik.
It is a criminal offence of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, thefts, whose victims have often suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of public authority and illicit armament.
Police have discovered illegally held guns, missiles with a steel core, a laser or a gun.
Gang, according to the charges, has come up with thefts for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost twenty men in this trial, courts have already recognised the guilty of other thefts of Berdych and many other people.
Other men around Berdych are still in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been tried before the court.
The main account has so far been avoided by Tomáš Pót and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their release for prosecution to the Czech Republic.
Children's exchange account: 12 million
For the replacement of children in the obstetrics, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba after the Třebíč hospital wants 12 million crowns, plus court expenses.
For each mother, three million, two million for her father and one million for her children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál therefore strongly disagrees with Veleby’s proposal.
“We reject this requirement, it is very high,” he said after today’s meeting.
“In order to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, however, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has been able to draw up.
We'll find out if it's worth it at all.
But we still believe that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all,” he said.
The amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
He served Veleb as a basis for negotiating a compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motol.
The parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychology, suffered psychological harm and stress in different degrees and depths.
Stress was better tolerated by men, even though they faced regrets that the confusion of newborns did not prevent them.
Women, in turn, struggle worse with the news of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, Veleb’s content summarized.
Veronika and Nikol were exchanged by nurses at the Trěbíča obstetrics last December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermák to Příbyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojanová to Jabloňov.
Hejtman Vysočina Miloš Vystřil handed over to the end of October each of the families of CZK 100,000 for the reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the mistake of the hospital in Prague, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of a mistake, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far admitted relatively low compensation to people, the amounts were calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup has lost the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polížka lost the dispute about the Valaš Kingdom brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, for the first time, the name of the Wallach king was used, but the project was built by a long-standing team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The soup did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably does not end and the client appeals.
“The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolka Polívaka,” the lawyer said after the trial.
In the words of the Kingdom of Wallach, everyone can remember the actors and the comics.
Harabish has the same opinion.
There is almost a decade of work behind us.
Seeking money and inventing actions, he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
“They want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
Luxury business
According to the court, the Wallachian king first used Polížka on his TV show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzozohatý.
This was not related to the intention of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From the original recessionist event, trade and lucrative business activity, to which Harabiš established the Valaš Kingdom.
In 1997, Polížka agreed to indicate her name and signature in passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting her farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said that Harabis had only used the bare idea that Soup had published in manage for his business purpose.
“The popularity of Boleslav Políka’s project of the Valaš Kingdom has certainly helped,” the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted intensively to him.
The cooperation of today’s defamatory parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Polívka.
From then on, however, disputes began to accumulate between Soup and Harabiš, which culminated in the settlement of the King Boleslav I. elected on the furt.
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen's mother.
In 2002, Polížka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
There could be a clear dispute with Harabiš about the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and the deadline were not yet to be revealed.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be like driving kings to Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can login,” Harabis added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing prejudices
In fact, I've never fanned the power of Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not much, the quality of the gearing, steering and also production could be described as under-average.
But there is now a successor to Peugeot 207 on the market, which is much better.
And the combination called SW goes a little further and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the head space on the back seats.
This is already a complaint, because the bodywork of the combo means that there will be no two-metre lengths in this direction.
the Summer of the World
The interior will pass very quickly, so that I do not repeat much.
This is a pretty good design, where I have the only output for a lean central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side line also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As for space, there is also a feeling of an increase in the dimensions of the body.
In combination, the aforementioned lack of room above the head.
Bags for the trunk
The main thing in this car is his luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (even thanks to the folding rear window) and as a decent storage.
Deaf places are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not hinder, it can be stretched, yet it will keep even heavier objects.
But let's pause together over the volume.
According to the tables, it is in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is against competition rather the average value.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of youngster product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging by a very noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I had to pick up the positives, I still have to mention a completely straight floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre petrol four-cylinder with a capacity of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a sixteen-year-old must look like that, which drives the family's hatchback.
It is quiet, it has a small consumption and, above all, it pulls.
If I compare it to the pests that are often used as if it had an exhausted cloth, then I can only be excited about it.
The Price List
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must keep in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a petrol 14-piste for CZK 329 900 is still to be missed.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is already quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then fit the equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic start of wipers, electric rear window control...
The car costs all 531,900 CZK.
It’s a lot, but count on the additional equipment at Fabie and you’ll get a lot of similar numbers.
So there's nothing left to choose for the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils at British schools fails
In British schools, children from Eastern European countries are growing, which raises concerns about the further development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far come to a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the indigenous people are overwhelming in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants begin to escalate.
Disputes, bullying, and struggles between pupils have also been brought into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
She defends herself that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls of the man reportedly took part in racist notes and threw stones on him.
“When we went home, some boy was climbing the bus stop and starting to swim on us.
When I told him to leave, he ran on us with apples and pears, and then revealed his ass,” the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant event for The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even identified disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle to survive.
The above-mentioned cases indicate that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovaks are registered who have been heading for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters, offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and intoxicated cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea you will find this in a complete and even richer list.
Only on one island you will find much more, and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antiquity.
For the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by the human eye.
Havana became a treasure store and translation site that the Spaniards in America broke and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
He was built by one of the US Mafia boss Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially for prohibitions) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were me.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew up, after wide boulevards, there were cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and in Cojemar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguity del Medio, both show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls in Havana Bodeguita you can leave your autograph as well.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, you can mix a cocktail according to your wishes.
And the iconic cars of the 1950s have been driving around Havana so far, because once imported nets and fiats in that salty and wet wind have long been destroyed.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is very pervasive, yet nowhere around there are as many magnificent colonial monuments as there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, such as Trinidad.
As tourism brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown up not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguin and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pound that is unique in the world and appreciated especially by trainmen.
A third of the vast plantations were brought to sugars by narrow rails of steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been restored for many decades, and so there are working machines, whose layers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not pass.
There is not much to be said about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in Hemingway’s already mentioned estate, and anyone who loves this writer should not miss his visit.
The valley of Vinnales One of Cuba’s most picturesque corners is the valley of Vinnales in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone floor.
Mogots, limestones and rocks rise up from the bottom of the valley, and in their cavity a fertile soil has been caught, thanks to which even the weathery rocks are covered with thick growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final form if you visit any of the Havana cigar production factories.
It may be interesting that Major Zeman’s work was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him the slave and sugar trade.
Wealth has been transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road that would link the country with the rest of the country.
She helped him stay away.
There was nothing there, and therefore nothing went wrong, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth checking out even more interesting places nearby such as Playa Ancon Beach or the Cucrovary Valley.
In the evening it belongs to go to Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark, and the music in it ticifies over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Indeed, such an opinion affects the path itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánama must overcome the high and broken mountains and go through nature that human activity almost did not notice.
Cuba’s eastern achievements have been recorded by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact, about a hundred years after Columbus's cruise) and from the hill where the former castle and today's El Castillo Hotel stand, several table mountains are seen, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Gulf of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, about the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about Santeria, African religions, which are descended by descendants of former slaves, many pages could be described about all of this.
As they say, it is better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, says Americans
Few soldiers and the lack of the necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a specific plan for next summer.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to the idea, in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordinating allies.
While the United States has been calling on NATO troops through Defense Secretary Robert Gates this week to take more action, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next one is to allow residents to start further economic and security development themselves,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has been the highest in the last five years, according to US military data.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which are in the southern territory.
According to the United States, the allies reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they ask for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
“We will have to seriously think about specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
“I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
“We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There have also been disputes among participating countries over the past few months as to whether allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
Germany has quite a lot of representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country,” Gates said.
The British bulgarian newspaper Sun described German soldiers as leechs this week.
“Afghanistan Pophalecs Revealed: Germans play while our boys are fighting,” Sun wrote in the material, complemented by a picture of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will burn out to a trillion in 2009
Every Czech Republic has a government debt of over 84,000 CZK.
The total debt increased to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government was planning to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better state budget management.
The state debt of the Czech Republic increased to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
In nine months this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, it has been reduced by CZK 13.4 billion.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on state debt from the beginning of October.
For each Czech Republic there is a debt of over 84,000 CZK.
For the whole year, the state has been indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
“For now, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we would be able to overcome the limit of trillion crowns only in 2009.
The next year should be between 900 billion and trillion crowns,” said David Marek, an analyst for iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora said: “To exceed one trillion, we could get through the course of 2009.
When will it depend on the next budget we don’t know yet?
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could shift to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts are growing
State debt is the debt of the central government and is mainly created by the accumulation of government deficits.
The state debt is financed by bank bonds, government bonds, direct loans or loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The country's foreign debt has so far increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called tradable state debt at the end of September reached 803.3 billion crowns and since June fell by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
Total debt increased by 13% year-on-year over the first to third quarter, which is actually a lot of how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when the pension reform is here,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The financing and debt management strategy for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
In early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better state budget management.
The amount is mainly a deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
In addition, it is a planned maximum resource for the Czech Consolidation Agency for CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state bonds for CZK 43 billion and loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
The woman is due to come to court in Khartoum today for giving the name to a plush bear.
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday night, according to her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds give a plush bear the name of Muhammad, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with a whip.
This British 40-year-old teacher, acting at the Unity High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and the rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins already in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-olds to choose a name for the class plush bear.
“From the mouth of children, eight names will be heard, including Hasan, Abdullah and Muhammad,” says school director Robert Boulos.
After the vote takes place in the class, 20 out of 23 children eventually choose as the most popular name of Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: ‘My name is Muhammad’.
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the difficulty is in depicting the prophet himself as an insult to Islam.
One of the fellow Muslims, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knows her well, and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: “I only regret asking children to vote for a name,” he said.
Many teachers who describe it as “very attentive to their pupils” also share this opinion, adding that “no one in the classroom speaks of religion.”
Remember that the first name Muhammad is also the second most often given first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of worshiping the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible to give them a toy?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosov Albanians finished their sixth round of talks on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming divergent views of the future status of this separatist province.
“It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on status,” European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is “at stake” and called on Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to keep peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations have ended.
“We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period,” he added, “is evident that the situation is tense.”
Negotiations end December 10
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last travel to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 per cent of the Albanian-speaking population, could turn out to be brighter as of December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to hand over their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the U.N. in August of this year, Troika has entrusted it with a new negotiation.
Americans and Europeans expect talks to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had previously blocked Kosovo’s independence in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue even after the deadline.
“Russia has been and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community governance, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that in the event that the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, independence is ready to be declared unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
“Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement,” said the President of the Kosovo Authority Fatmir Sejdia in the Baden Hotel, where this “last chance deal” took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, the former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and the future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy introduced by Belgrade - it belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations -
The Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still coming into consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of any unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the “dominal effect” in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
“But for Serbia, that does not mean,” he said, “that compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
“Only solutions arising from the Security Council are acceptable for Serbia,” said Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
It took two years for this to happen.
It must end as it began: on the territory of the Security Council
The journalist Fatmir Sedjiu replied that “the last word about status will be held by the Kosovo Parliament” and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking citizens, it would have been, after an agreement, with the West.
Bush signed an agreement with Israelis and Palestinians
At the start of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called upon by his drive, US President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed to launch an immediate negotiations with the intention once and for all to resolve a 60-year dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure”, and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, and recalled the obligations that both sides have flown from the “road map” to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas were intended to “encourage a peace treaty that would solve all undecided questions without exception, including central issues.”
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees driven out of their homes in the present-day state of Israel in 1948.
Abbas took the word after the U.S. president and emphasized that the follow-up negotiations should be “total and thorough” and that it would touch all aspects of the solution, including “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Then Olmert spoke to the tribunal, who expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be “direct and continuous” and that it should be “composed to be concluded during 2008”,
Bush defined the end of 2008 as the date of the implementation of his ‘vision of two states’, Palestinian and Israeli, existing next to each other.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has accepted a commitment from Bush in this sense before she decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, offering Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories taken in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is fighting against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” says Prince Saud, in an interview with one Arab-speaking newspaper, which was filled with Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspection of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car passed on Sunday shortly after 17 o'clock on the streets of Louise-Michel in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
“The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on the patrol and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, while the side lights were not switched on,” the police source explains.
Kawasaki’s green motorcycle, “unregistered, and therefore without the right to ride on public roads” (read below), driven by two young people without helmets, passed at a very high speed.
“The motorcycle hit the police car from the left after it didn’t prefer to the right,” a police officer said.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew was negative.
The condition of the car (stretched forefather, broken foreglass, pointed bumpers) shows the impact rate.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry said last morning that the IGPN had entrusted the investigation of the unintended killings and the failure to assist people in the threat - which is also being conducted by the direction départemente de la sépartementé publique du Val-d'Oise (department of the Regional Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of an afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witnesses of the accident, who had been interviewed on Sunday night, confirmed by the official that the police were approaching them quite quickly from the left.
A kind of groove, undoubtedly caused by the friction of the clips about the ground, yesterday showed that both vehicles remained spelled until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles were secured and passed through technical expertise.
A pituitary was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people quickly spread the talk that police officers should quickly leave the crime scene without giving two young people first aid.
The IGPN should, in all caution, also rule out any serious guilt at this point.
“It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation that requires more research and with which it is necessary to be very careful,” the police source said.
The Libération daily met with an eye-witness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“We, together with our cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, ran down to try to resurrect them,” this witness says.
I couldn't do anything -
Then he saw a totally scared police officer.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the youths, and the fourth spoke on the phone.
Faced with the fast-growing tension and confidence that the situation of the youngsters is hopeless, the police were taken by car by colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the site.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the police officers left.
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
“Let no one say that police authorities did not help young people.
These young people were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them, the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan are growing
Pakistan's police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the announcement of the state of emergency by General Musharaf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken in exceptional condition, garnets with tear gas were injured, which, according to witnesses, used order forces.
The last names answered with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded lawyers.
A few of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were overrun on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement received support from religious parties grouped in the politically strong League of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president-invited the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency, and trash to those who had sworn before Musharaf.
“Musharaf’s promise is not true.”
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is a direct target of an emergency measure declared on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharaf’s re-election in an indirect presidential election that took place on October 6.
Iftikhar President Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
“All we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional, and against the Supreme Court’s judgments,” the official said in The News.
Parvíz Musharaf's promise to give up the army's leadership and become civil president, \"doesn't apply\" after the introduction of the state of emergency, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said Monday.
He was expected to give up military uniforms by November 15, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government otherwise also refuted the country’s ongoing speculation that a representative of the army’s chief was to order President Musharaf to prison.
More than a third of pregnancy still forms an unexpected pregnancy.
This calculation includes unwanted (24%) pregnancy as well as poorly planned or occurring in an unexpected way.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected today, a study led by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined)- State Institute of Demography Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which passed contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted (24%) pregnancy as well as poorly planned or occurring in an unexpected way.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% rate of failure, according to Ined.
According to the Institute, the use of hormonal contraceptives in women between the ages of 20 and 44 has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight births out of ten today are well planned.
One couple of five has a birth even calculated for a month exactly and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant season for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work was needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) for the remarkable repair of the torn solar panel necessary for the further scientific operation of the station.
It was a risky exit to space that collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed at which it was planned and the degree of ‘cuttleness’ that the astronauts used to repair.
The difficulties occurred on Tuesday, while astronauts from Discovery landed Harmony, a large rolling unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing moth for the module-laborator.
You need to be able to supply electricity.
Therefore, the second task of the crew was to relocate a 17-point module producing electricity using solar panels already located on the ISS to anchor at its final station.
After relocating it, the crew began to disassemble 70-metre solar panels of the module.
And in this there was one of the panels, decomposing as a drag harmonica, due to the snap of the cable, damaged on the area almost one meter.
The layout has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to perform a control output to the Discovery ship, and then go repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a failure, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the shoulder of the station, and carried out the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers (the space pedestrian) of the US Aviation and Space Authority (NASA).
High, stale, very agile, has a very developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was entrusted by the doctor to “operation” a solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed to the damaged places a kind of -problems -
He was assisted by a second Spacewalker, who remained near the balancing chamber, and also from the inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the commander of the crew.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey sealed with an insulation device to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and, after Kutilsk, produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disassembled and then invented his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Last afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day’s rest before seven astronauts returned to Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS
EADS shares are losing heavily on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the airline’s aerospace and defence industry announced it would have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face the delay of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange for 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from slow progress progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the start-up flight.
The price for relieving the delay in military cargo aircraft deliveries, announced in October, was estimated at €1.2 to €1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus, according to the European construction company EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT) on Thursday.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponded with a six-month delay.
In 2006, the production results of the EADS fell by 86%, particularly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army would be provided in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday’s elections will take place without a tense expectation: the Russian majority will elect the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
In this way, after the end of a very little free election campaign, its commitment to stability, or authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will tell voters on public law stations a pre-recorded TV message, but the content of which is kept secret.
He is the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, who seems to celebrate the overwhelming victory.
When he received ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president did not let anything come out of him and was satisfied with another attack on the West accused of intervening - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and wish for the most transparent and open choice possible, the choice without the slightest defect in beauty,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from happening.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says that \"no such dirty elections have ever been held, neither for Yeltsin.\"
Following the repressions accompanying the demonstrations last weekend, former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, has been banned by his lawyer.
Russians remained homo Soviet mentality.
Against the backdrop of these parliamentary elections of simple tensioned expectations, two more open questions are profiling:
\"Who will become Putin's successor to the presidential office?
The official letter yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
However, no follower appears.
“What role will Putin play after March?”
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and omnipotent parties of the United Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line in parliamentary elections as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
Russians are left with a homo Soviet mentality, they do not feel like masters of their fate, according to sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Petěrburg notices a more distant connection: civil society gained, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, a delay; that famous common spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin called for a paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than accompanying terror but some economic well-being, said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are now “voluntaryly giving up their personal responsibility” shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
\"Why think -
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total 85 heads of the Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, the Russians will also not vote for extremists.
Tamara Čerednchenko, 40-year-old professor: ‘Why think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, are open to the public.
47 million archival documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible by this time only for a “humanitarian” purpose, that is, individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven states responsible for managing archives, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open them to scientists and historians in May.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening of yesterday has come into force.
Sensitive information
“The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow us to explore, in particular, the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were opposed to making these names available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants assembled by Gestapo were collected after the war for a practical purpose to find deported or forced labour subjected to civilian citizens, to bring them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
“Nothing new can be expected from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin’s Technische Universität.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Today, bilateral trade between Europe and India amounts to almost €60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first business partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Treaty in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission a Green Paper to launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India is already reaching almost €60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU's ninth trading partner.
“The Free Trade Agreement is hugely overcrowding both economies, and “India will gain better access to the market for 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of India’s first ten products, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants are shifting €47 billion in goods and €10 billion in service this week, according to Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its full potential, the EU and India will meet at the 8th Joint Diplomatic Summit in New Delhi on Friday, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durau Barrosa.

The Bank of England took note of concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England said on Thursday it intends to mitigate current concerns that credit market conditions will worsen again and announced a £10 billion bid at a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer valid unusually long.
“In an effort to ease the concerns that the conditions in the financial markets will be very unfavorable at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty in the way they secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,” she said in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at a basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It normally takes a week.
BOE adds in its communications that it is “prepared to take further measures to keep interest rates on an interbank basis at the same level with its core rate.
The inter-bank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the rates of charge that have discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations strengthened by the development of the pound rate against the euro, many prefer to opt for amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and greater discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement populare, Union for People's Movements) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Center) refuse to address the Socialist (PS) proposals on purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the various paragraphs of the socialist draft law on purchaseability, which is equal to rejecting the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law came under the so-called socialist-hnid (meeting initiated by the individual member club) and included ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, including an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the restoration of fluctuating TIPPs, a transport check or the regulation of rents.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after the general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of opinion, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television performance on the purchase capacity.
PS MP Jean- Marc Ayrault announced that his club would re-submit these proposals in full in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act, which will be discussed next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations about C3 Presents setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, he announced this promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Republic Festival of the British organizer Melvin Benn.
“It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” said Charlie Jones of C3 Billboard.com.
The C3 is produced by the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer destination camper station.
The festival should take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500 acres private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known under the name Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the chair of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Republic Festival founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury “the most inspiring event” ever experienced and says that his company and Melvina Benna work simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
“We initially chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“I negotiated with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, because of the city’s current leadership, we have been in politics, says Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benne and we are going to start a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the residents of Philadelphia.”
In 2005, the C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after they made their debut on the festival scene by organizing Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to derail both concepts in a certain way, so that we create both the impression of the rural festival in European and urban terms in American terms.
Vineland is located about half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s audience, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims, “that they are advantageous enough to allow investment in such an event and to welcome the festival that it will have, hopefully, a long duration.”
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is “very high”, similar to that of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will hold 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is only given to the press.
“Vineland will have a rock touch, but the music will be beautiful to attract a wide spectrum of viewers,” said Carlie Jones.
C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter in the Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it.
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is \"politically demanding\" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns \"runaway productions\"
Is it difficult to fall into the “Guvernator”?
“It is necessary to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it will go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
“Our job is to offer what they think is the best,” he said.
Homba for festivals
At the moment, however, the priority of the Denise Turcottea is the promotion of the local film.
The hunt for Oscars has already begun.
At all the West Coast festivals, whether it’s festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about presenting quorum films, drawing attention to them and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
A few weeks ago, the age of darkness had a good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, it will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also introduced four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experty split 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors already have my hands on me in the expectation that a traditional marathon will occur at the end of the year.
This year, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banka Banif believes that “from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange”
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, some doubts -
These experts do not assume that the exchange is moving in recent weeks of the year, and they state that ‘the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is prepared to invest due to missing alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income affected by the turnover effect on quality securities, both in long and short periods’.
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, “especially because the impact of the likely decline in the Fed (Federal Reserve System) rates is unknown, due to the high level of oil prices and the risk of incentivising inflationary pressures.”
Javier Barrio, the head of BPI’s sales in Spain, agrees that there is no right time for a bold statement that a marathon will take place.
“There is not too much reason to be happy,” said this expert.
Ibex lost nearly 4 percent of the maximum recorded on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year by a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional pension insurance deposits that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitutional Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical levels and, therefore, we could observe a reflection of the index, triggered by US reports on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.
Analysts believe that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on selecting titles to bring Ibex to new maximum quotes.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that 'the summer is a series on strong titles'
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive.
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the rises will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been recapturing positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way,” the expert explains.
Cycle consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to increased sales during the Christmas season.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will do very well, even though it is not very well represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only two times a month of decline.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock market ended the crisis caused by the crack of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will see whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will succeed in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the popular bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular decided to upgrade most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a major change for the bank.
It is also the first group to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and open on Saturdays from 10 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to take this step.
Meanwhile, it intends to conclude an agreement with trade unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to join or not join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of trades.
This is exactly the goal of the project that has been identified by the Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, tradesmen and shops from selected streets, where there will be an opening of branches.
The bank wants to open 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting already existing ones.
For this reason, the bank upgrades the branches it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This is complemented by another concept of the branch space and a new, more recent design in lighter colors.
Ángel Rivera’s business director assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it moves from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with spaces for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative at three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
There were branches in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 immigrants who are operated under the Mundocredit brand also have a very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax affiliates will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
\"We don't want to compete with our clients,\" Rivera says.
They have just agreed with Telephonic for the sale of mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antenna for the first time on the stock exchange
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, Chief Executive Officer of Telecinco, in his satisfaction at the end of the trade, when he stated that the television he manages doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: ‘What I’m sorry for is that it didn’t happen because we would grow more, but because we fell less,’ he said.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, we 'we fell less'.
Telecinco ended trading by 2.54%.
This profit shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) thus, according to Bloomberg data, amounts to EUR 4,488,88 million.
Its Antenna 3 competitor, who fell by 1.52 percent yesterday and fell by 40.5 percent since January, has a half-value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been rated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million in Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Dies) and 1.779 billion in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is offered because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market at what cost and how we will evaluate it in the follow-up.”
Telecinco announced last week that this year it is counting on overcoming billions of gross advertising revenue to become the first TV channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive chairman of Telecinco and Publisspaña, a branch that provides advertising to the group.
If the estimated data were actually achieved, this television channel would see an increase in advertising turnover by 3.6% this year compared to 964.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (and thus reached 734.4 million), while net revenues of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay out, which has been maintained so far: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early for decision making, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
\"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported much more.
I hope this year we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market at these times shows some fatigue.
Belgrade Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco’s profit in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
This is due to the fact that the expected growth in revenue stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antenna 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles mainly based on increased yields for dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco (collect) better than Antenu 3 (maintain) because of its 'many advantages' and trade growth.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to overestimate them, as they face ‘similar threats’ (saturated market and a deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approves the transposition of MiFID valid from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were closed today by a vote by Congress on amendments incorporated by the Senate in the draft law, the government has been subject to a public hearing of the regulation that is developing a new law with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
MiFID, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized companies and legal entities and will create a new type of financial services companies (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities brokerage offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of operations with financial instruments is expanding by connecting multilateral trading systems and internalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stock brokers.
The law further obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires a statement of all operations carried out to simplify the supervision by the CNMV.
A number of adjustments were included in the Congress’s business committee, including the fact that securitised claims were considered as “complicated” financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the U.S. with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to statutoryly define the functions that bachelors in the field of economics and business management may hold 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide services for trading in products and acquiring clients for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November.
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat’s and Central European Bank’s (CEB) policies to provide data over time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the harmonised consumer price index, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore it does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will fall within the known date of 14 December of this year.
ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level.
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said November's ISC increase to 4.1% was - temporary - but he also predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively high in the coming months -
In any case, Solbes said that, even if this is not a favorable number, the inflational differential of Spain towards the monetary union has been the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November was less surprising than the previous month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
“We expected a value of about 4%,” the minister said.
Virgin plans to make $42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock’s crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually decreased over two and a half months by distrust of clients even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces its name with Virgin Money, needs to earn around a quarter of the income deposited in British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
A group of magnate Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for his iconic advertising campaigns, is planning to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its resolution.
This week, the Northern Rock Bank identified the Virgin consortium’s offer of three other companies as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of Totana (from the People's Party) in the early hours of the morning due to his alleged involvement in corruption practices during the construction that were revealed this week.
Another secretary of the town hall and the head of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current member of the People's Party, and until then the mayor of the village, who, according to the sources of investigation addressed to the televisions of Caden SER, could have been the head of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the City Hall and Construction Commission buildings and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect of corruption practices in construction, was accused of being discovered earlier this week.
As Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'people' MP Juan Morales, who was checked, was arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the sources of investigation, Morales’ alleged selection of commissions for his signature of a construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which was retrained 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono has accepted the offer of state at the head of the Toledic candidate PSOE and, if they win, preside over Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the proposal of Prime Minister and Secretary-General José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to lead the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general elections and, if socialists win the general election, he became President of Congress.
This was announced at the press conference by the PSOE secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place at the federal headquarters of the party this afternoon.
The head of the executive's offer to the former minister was justified by the fact that in political life it is important to count on the best - and Bono - is among the best -
He further noted that “yes,” it seems, that this politician from La Mancha will be a candidate of the Socialist Party for the President of Congress if the socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision not to run in the next general elections on November 15, and leave his active political career to fight climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had constantly urged him to return to the top policy he had left two years ago.
He further stated that, just as citizens know who will be the deputy minister of the economy, if the PSOE wins elections, his party wanted, in a transparent way, to announce who will preside over Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes that the House will turn into a “house of respect,” not an old age or a scream, and will achieve that “it will become more and more like a citizen”
“Unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where Congress cannot be spoken in peace, the Prime Minister of the Senate, on one occasion, was interrupted 26 times.
In the same way, he spoke praiseful words to the address of present-day President Manuel Marín and “his good work”, and he did not want to imagine himself in his place so far, that he would not reduce himself to what his opponents might think of as “the greatness.”
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subjected to merciless persecution both by those who view skeptically on its predictions and by those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must show firm coherence.
And in addition, to have a leader of a movement that is the Prime Minister like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal forces him to explain why his government’s activity or inaction contributed significantly to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this non-fulfillment, in which sectors this is happening, and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it forces him to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to stop climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices himself and who pays to save the planet.
But we can't wait to see this explanation.
It is because we have to sacrifice and pay.
Action against climate change, real action, is unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one centime of the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spain's Socialist Workers' Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of election that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords that miss any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by covenants with the planet; this master is so useful for an election campaign that does not even speak, accuses, demands nothing, but is a decoration of the meeting rooms and raises it.
If it is limited to being only a virtual party and does not require us to ride a bike and cool down with a believer.
Mayor and head of local police Totany arrested for suspected corruption practices in construction
As reported by the sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, the people of José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one entrepreneur in hospitality, for suspicion of committing crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transported to the town hall, whose premises are now located together with a number of police officers, who also came to the Construction Commission and the Municipal Business for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
The three arrests were added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving retraining more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the past election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but were charged in a short-term trial before the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, previous mayor of Totana is being investigated and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament of the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of the real estate agency, was charged today in Totana and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria Group, a lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Niger (the province of Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribery was handed over.
The investigation is carried out by a group of criminals in the construction of an operational unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also conducted eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the arrests, based in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was imprisoned, in the area of a very well-known owner of the company, on products from poultry meat, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with the position of the largest residential complex in Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf courses and two se-spa hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was retrained and its project was supposed to double the settlement of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruňa, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
And that happens too.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (although at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, on the same day that the critique of Blackburn’s book appeared there, according to the circumstances:
“The scope of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the city of Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, cited Plato and Nietzsche's work in his messages.
Pekka Elo, Education Councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, asked Helsingin Sanomat to take a critical position on Platon and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the mandatory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools.

One colleague informs of the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime at a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you alienate boards in the store at a price below 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to 1,000 euros in trade, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for withdrawal (§ 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for withdrawal (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a compact shift.
Participation in the breakage has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be the rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a film on a DVD according to § 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic material to adolescents (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, she was taking someone's hand, and that's right.

My treating doctor will push me one of his articles on strange research called “Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less”
The feelings that make a monthly salary for employees depend on how much your colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonances on the tomographer and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader group Viewing the neurocognition of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly”
Researchers observed that if both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one received twice, the activation was higher.
I don't really know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuted by a Balkan war criminal from the Court’s State Prosecutor’s Office in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, because the main perpetrators of the massacre in Srebrenica, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadžič, are still free.
Their names are on the list, from which he took the title of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach-Karlin List (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which at the pace of the detective thriller follows from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the pursuit of refugees and pressure on the respective states to pull the net.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, is a significant expenditure that depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driving licence, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This liability shall take the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking receives an agreed insurance amount of a certain amount for taking care of the payment of damages in the event of an accident.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined with respect to various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driving licence, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely the accident is, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons older than 25 years and women must pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the controls, insurance companies concluded that people living in marriage had fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the rides and thus the likelihood that it will have an accident.
The increase in driving frequency increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose such insurance that best corresponds to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables to choose one or the type of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages such as little driving experience and short driving license when they want to arrange insurance at an affordable price.
Although it is ideal for good coverage that insurance against all risks exists, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance so that they get insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
“The amount of insurance payment provided by the client will be fixed in advance when determining the insurance price, which will be higher, the lower the participation would be,” explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance provider.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants by insuring the client against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendations.
If you are under twenty-five years old, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, the small amount is an increase in the above-mentioned basic rate.
The bonus and the small one will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” explains Noguera.
After exceeding the limit of twenty-five years, drivers are easier to arrange insurance, because the risk index of the client decreases, thanks to their experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks with a discount.
“Young people can’t usually take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident and even in the course of the proceedings,” the director of the European company in Spain assures, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the proceedings, when the fear of the novice has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if, however, his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered to be clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their gains will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other traffic participants, starting from the third year after the vehicle was purchased.
“His driving is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford to gain the highest discount,” says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised insurance against all risks with a discount of the insurance ($150) or insurance extended to other participants of the operation if a high bonus was achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents considerable expenditure, which is a good reason to properly examine the insurance options that would suit us most with regard to our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point at AC Milan, which means 8th-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to score the point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, because it would mean first for Italy and for the Scottishs it would decide to place it.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured progress in the fifth match with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to make sure that the Chessman does not get in front of him with six points, which will play with Benfika, which has four.
The two games of Group D will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where he first enters the 13th in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the 16th final.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others and the indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems most likely, although both teams will try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tactify on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the win he would be the first and secure a better place in the 8th final.
Gordon Strachan’s team could even be able to lose if the Chessman did not win, but he could not rely on it, because with the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2:1) will move forward, but won in the first direct match (2:0).
So AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening of Scotland, who believe that for the second time they will get into the semi-final in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the past competition with a goal of extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hope that they will win -rossoners - will be Chessman, for whom he is worth a victory, only if Celtic loses, both for the progress to the 8th final and for the stay in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, could win a third place, so she would play in UEFA.
The first Spice Girls concert was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver.
Spice Girls started its first tour in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 spectators since it broke up in 2000.
\"Posh Spice\" (Victoria Beckham), \"Scary Spice\" (Melanie Brown), \"Baby Spice\" (Emma Bunton), \"Sports Spice\" (Melanie Chisholm) and \"Ginger Spice\" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place in Vancouver, they declared that their band's reunification is \"Great\"
About 20,000 people bought tickets so they could be present for a concert, which also included a video that depicts the history of this group that sparked sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time that they are getting a new album released in Spain by the EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, “Headlines” and “Voodoo”
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets, which was given to them by their husband, Posh Spice, a British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, although the nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Prior to Victoria Beckham’s performance, she told the British star that “he didn’t see our costumes at all, so I’m nervous about what he thinks about the show.”
\"Sports Spice - whose departure from the group in 1998 - due to the disagreements between us - caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, she also revealed her nervousness at a meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion changed, the opinion of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I decided,\" Chisholm said of the reconnection of the group she had dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time “things have settled and we all love each other”
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last appeared together in 1998.
At the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with the Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival at the airport, the army was expecting a carnage.
Five have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He will be performing in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns about the new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the price of natural gas, and thus the risk that Russian fuel supplies to Western Europe may be affected.
The majority of Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is led by a pipeline across Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas to Ukraine, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, seeks to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40 percent more for its supplies from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatolij Kinach told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) through Ukraine,” he said.
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev resulted in a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a devastating fall in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large part of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS must control foreign employees
The controller said the Scottish NHS chambers had to improve criminal records checks for non-European workers.
The recommendation came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to June’s attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key controls were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was interested immediately after the June attacks at Glasgow Airport on personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, an eight-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone shot Jeep at the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of connecting to attempts to bomb attacks in the UK.
NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although Scottish health commissions use Disclosure Scotland for criminal record controls, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
A report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the Commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which assists employers with controls in several countries.
“Although we found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they were not carried out regularly,” the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS has largely coincided with its own pre-employee review policy, but also added: “Our report draws attention to areas where the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the amount of foreign personnel,” he said.
BMA Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employee controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
“The report suggests that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS work well and it is not clear what further value these comments will bring,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would be probably higher also because the Commission had difficulty identifying staff authorised to stay.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Cyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are to a large extent carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently revising the policy and pre-employee control directives for foreign workers of the NHS.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “I wanted to do this job immediately after a terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She also added that the Scottish government will consider the recommendations of this report in accordance with health committees and ensure that best practices appear in the updated guidelines for pre-employee controls of all personnel - including foreign ones - which she plans to issue next month.

Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard guys, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This 50-year-old film, including Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones, the Kingdom of the Crystal skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of the films Camelet and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors for people like me,” he added.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, I'm very honored --
Independent film awards, known as Bifas, are awarded by a jury where filmmakers, actors and festival organizers sit.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbott.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Last year, Saudi Arabia announced it had arrested 208 militants for cell membership preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities as well as spiritual and security forces.
The state's largest oil exporter said one of the cells wanted to infiltrate missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, allies of the United States since 2003, from the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil facilities in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response unit of 35,000 members to defend equipment from al-Qaeda’s failed attack on the world’s largest oil processing factory in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested were part of a cell led by an expert to launch missiles that entered the country.
She said the militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were supposed to prepare the murders of spiritual and security personnel.
The government urged the spiritual to try more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied troops and Shia-backed U.S. government, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretic.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that authorities have co-opted many spiritual forces in Saudi Arabia to support a royal family that controls the government.
The militants, supported by the challenges of al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden, focused on the pro-Western Saudi government, focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
“This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months,” he said.
A 16-member media cell was also arrested in Medina, which was aimed at promoting “Takfirian thinking,” an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims labeled as non-believers and apostasy.
Among the arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is possible by looking at the future of the Earth.
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from orbiting European stations show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's own twin head than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbiting similar expensive ones, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago the conditions were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the plasticized greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower rotational speed sent Venus after a completely different path of development.
Today the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and winds about the strength of the hurricane.
Findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for one year, offers a meticulous view of how Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear why the climate in Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite different.
“Our new data enables us to build a scenario in which Venus began the same way as Earth, perhaps even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago.”
The police arrested the enriched uranium.
Kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was being investigated.
He did not confirm it was a enriched uranium, but he said the substance could be sold for $1 million (480 000 pounds).
Still open
Mitt Romney said that it is not worthy of answering questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and passed them on for broadcast to candidates.
None of the questions posted on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as a snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many about the state of the Republican Party towards the next year’s elections.
It is unclear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time dedicated to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest Republican topics.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the disc when they heard something comforting: the voter recorded the summits of consent when candidates talked about a hard approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who went ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake up the reputation of a man who was soft at illegal immigrants as mayor of New York City.
He attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two struggled especially fiercely when asked if any of the candidates would support “amnesty” (give illegal immigrants a normal status and citizenship opportunity).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game because they started hitting alarms because of immigration earlier and stronger than others.
At least immigration has the same opinion: more strictness at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns about the surrounding world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the contradiction between the libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to be very unpleasant when there were other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word from the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani said that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn’t literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the recent Iowa survey due to his long-term Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thus earning laughter.
The fight is extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise in Iowa has been lurking with recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul’s loud laugh at Wednesday’s debate.
The two have turned away from the bottom, because both parties’ wings are still unable to agree on more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning report on American size on the lips, mucking on both sides.
This time, the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour Pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
It does not seem that any orders were sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital rings were smelled.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have avoided without it being discovered that some wealthy entrepreneur had masked contributions from the ruling Labour Party for four years of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by surveys, there was hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of formulating this more and more funny representative of the Liberal Democrats, the once-feared Mr Brown turned from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unscathed rescue of the problem bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative management.
Three generals in retirement started a rebellion in the House of Lords; protested against cuts in military spending as they claimed that being commander of armed forces was part-time labor.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of Labour (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is always moving towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the tipping point behind which they find governance difficult.
People don’t believe in politicians and don’t like them, but they usually put their distrust away when a new party takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister probably won’t improve anything, and may not be in office for a long time, this is a move away: state administration is becoming bleak, ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming uncentered and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown’s position is particularly complex, because he cannot take the position of a new church against other political leaders.
Whatever he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the financial office are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as finance minister.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blairian maladies, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by the “worthy of money” voters can confidently judge that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's trouble is not as bad as they look.
They are not as terrible as conservatives do them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been deluded.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The latest excitement around political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's progress, but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly questioned; as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour money-seeker, who learned about the clumsy gifts of October.
But yet Mr. Brown is not involved in any way; there is nothing that suggests he knew about these troubles, even though the main part of the payment took place only after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but diluted his resolve by following a proven instrument, the commission for the investigation of the matter - also led by the bishop in retirement and judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complex.
If the law was violated, it is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require Labour who are in close contact with conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with trade unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party, such as Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The conservatives now have a decent lead in the surveys; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to extort victory is by irresistible integrity and high competence.
Cardiard sharks
Does the crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the back fins naturally begin to move around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is intimidating, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses, if other consumer credit variants were infected with subordinate mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
The number of insolvency cases (with more than 30-day late payment) and depreciated accounts (accounts considered unenforceable by the provider) is increasing.
HSBC reported last month that it lost $1.4 billion on the U.S. consumer credit market - also due to insolvency credit card loans.
However, it is still early in panic.
There are still few accounts and the inability to pay back.
According to Moody’s, the 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost the whole percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US Personal Bankruptcy Act 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcys that make a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase, regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how many consumers pay off their debts each month.
And trust in securities secured credit cards is firm, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney, a research firm at TowerGroup, predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct paths to spread the infection between the sub-credit crisis and the credit card market definitely exist: when property loans are dried out in real estate, consumers are rather indebted via credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, look at the cash flow rather than the value of the guarantee items, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the lenders.
They can even be beneficial for loan providers.
Consumer motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets drops below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up to the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid change in the price of the guarantee items.
“It doesn’t happen that one beautiful morning we would just rethink all loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s financial manager.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subordinate mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those back fins.
British bankers guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud associated with former financial manager Enron Andrew Fastow changed their lives on Wednesday and admitted their guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven fraud charges, where they and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves in the account of their employers -- denied.
They were to stand before the court in January.
However, during a trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest executives, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was featured on the front page for two years, which lasted the publishing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The allegations brought against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's collapse.
A lawsuit against bankers -- who earned the nickname \"NatWest Triangle\" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to sleep fraud together with Fastow and his former chief affiliate Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron’s partnership, controlled by Fastow, who was an architect of many enronist scams that pushed Enron after the spiral towards the declaration of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this branch by zero, but our three British knew it was actually of significant value.
Under Kopper’s control, the company bought the bank’s stake in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper for his share of the company $250,000.
According to Fastow, Enron has falsely reported that the energy company will pay $20 million for its share in Greenwich NatWest.
But those 20 million were actually British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received $7.3 million, and Fastow, Kopper, and others increased by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow guilty in two cases of conspiracy for his role in Enron’s collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were free on a $1 million deposit that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of billing tricks could no longer hide billions of debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse cancelled thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron’s founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the company’s downfall.
Skilling is in the exercise of more than twenty-four years of punishment.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were cleared after he died of heart disease last year.
The Moscow Non-Impotence
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
“He can carry up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of them are interested in so many places, because it’s for a narrow family or corporate president.”
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of great consumption in a mammoth exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers have built their booths, hoping that freshly rich Russians will attract everything from mahogany-loaded yachts to diamonds decorated with bulkheads into cars, for which 50 Cent would not be ashamed.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche at the side stand.
“That’s a nice car, but it’s fives and tens of tens against us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.
On the waves of oil, money is spent in the Russian capital just as much as when it had its days in Dallas.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got rich and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians became the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Klondik.
In another place in Moscow this week, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, and Bernard Arnault, LVMH Group president, attracted a conference to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The International Herald Tribune is owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total worth of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the local Institute of Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 second-class millionaires in Russia, whose assets amounted to $670 billion.
(The World Bank says 15.8% of Russians lived below the existing minimum in 2005.)
\"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here,\" said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London's jewelery David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are perfectly modified, and men are all for the whole fortune.”
As they walked in the evening dress on Sunday evening with halls, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five-year-old Svetlana Turovacová described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I was looking at those cars and I couldn’t decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatov, who was going out in branded clothing as a veteran of red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a domestic cord.
The fair seemed to focus primarily on fresh goods, brand-controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit for several hours in road traffic, so that they could walk around the warehouse, which Cadillacy Escalade screamedly mixed, platinum ponds, Mövenpick ice cream, billiards, apartments in Dubai, plushounds Gund and pravan.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt’s image from hand-painted blue tiles in a lifetime.
- Of course, Russia is interested in more gold -
Indeed, the local sellers say that the Russians with old money (according to Russian standards is 10 to 15 years old) have already shifted from the glossy logo to the few known brands of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires’ envoys or tourists, have been flooded daily by the trade fair halls.
Some of them were shopping.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, said Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil bed, that he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, intertwined with gold threads, after $70,000.
Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, who equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, who adjusts luxury cars to sell three grids to cars in the style of chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms after $55,000.
He showed the reporter the wheel of the car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a knit coated with Swarovski crystal so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four such.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to ride on the wheels from the fur skin or portrait of his wife from the cube zirconium, doesn’t have to ride on those wheels yet,” said Mr. Karapetian.
He will store them in his garage of thirty to forty cars.
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean anything very exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of the local real estate.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
There are more of them than you think.
Those who are not millionaires could at least kiss wealth at the stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company built four red British-style phone booths filled with a column of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
They stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to let their friends take a picture of themselves on a mobile phone, as they rest in the middle of a spare wealth, or simply fill a pocket with a few million.
“You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey Maybe Caused By Corrupted Operations
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked from the big windows of the local restaurant about a little healthier and watched an ambulance that came to the white New England house by two houses that followed West Scott Avenue.
The car was soon joined by police patrols.
And then another one.
“Then I saw the delivery of the court doctor coming,” said Mr. Livingston, restaurant controller.
At that point, I knew someone had died.
The authorities found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, the executive assistant director of the New York Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at House 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused the death of Miss Arroy, and they hope that the toxicological tests whose results may not yet be known for weeks will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness through the leadership of the New York police.
Ms. Arroy has been assistant police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, tough and hard-working,” Mr. McCarthy said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
It was my shield.
It would protect me -
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, leaving behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepson.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankowa, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy had died from unlicensed surgery.
“It’s one of the options,” Miss Walsh said.
The investigation is still ongoing -
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
November and found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
More than a week later, authorities said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is reportedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't tell if Ms. Castro's office had been heard.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of the house of Miss Castro, with a broken pink bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the cellar, he throned in an open garage a blue barrel with the inscription \"Ethyl Vanilla\" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain bikes on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York Police Department after 25 years, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in perceiving his new city’s intolerable and harsh political culture.
“She said, ‘You should be careful about this one or this one,’” he said.
“She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing -
Hope that the Fed will reduce interest rates leads to a strengthening of global exchanges
Prices of shares on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm the lending conditions further by reducing interest rates were strengthened by calming statements by the Vice Presidents of the US Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in order behind Ben Bernank, Fed president, said that in responding to continued pressure on financial markets, executives must be flexible and pragmatic.
As part of a clear effort to calm the irritable markets in the midst of signs of reinvigorating credit efforts, Mr Kohn said that recent excitements - partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets by the end of September and October -
He further stated that if increased instability persists, the possibility of the financial conditions of households and companies further deteriorating will increase.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh capital benefits to the US markets, and perhaps further reduction of interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of the financial belief were underscored by Bear Stearns’ announcement that it would cancel 650 jobs, which is 4% of its global workforce, in the context of cost reduction due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by an unsolicited wager on the provision of subordinate housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these locations are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55%, and closed to 13,289,40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65%.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6 306.2, with the value of the British blue-chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
A few years ago, credit tensions on the markets proved to be in full force after the auction of the European Central Bank’s three-month cash packages were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, which is most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release above-standard money into London’s money markets has increased, with the rates of three-month British interbank loans, Libor, rising to its maximum from the end of September, to 6.59 percent after uninterrupted growth from 12 November.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be the number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is going to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, Chairman of the Electoral Commission, who holds on to this post at the best at the loaned time, has Peter Moores, Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, Captain, with the decision to help, and because the Hugh Morris table, the main manager of the English team, begins to perform applications for the national picker's post, although not necessarily full-time.
He who will not be built on the bat in the sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is no longer at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of happiness rather than a skill.
Not only in the cryout is the choice challenging and requires judgment, which ultimately must always be subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same thing in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or \"Tubby - Banerjee, both smart young leaders with a good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the commission - the place is just for one.
Who is to say which level is right for the Cricketers if he can’t get the chance to fall or swim on the next one?
Of course, numbers have a great impact on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the Cricket must at the right time capture the view of the captain, if he is to take a Wicket, and the batter needs regular chances of starting positions, if he ever has to make an impression as a one-day Cricket.
To capture the viewer’s view is more complicated.
For example, last season, there were many better ones that James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and cast as a artillery.
Anderson took 32 wikis in the first class at 33 runs for each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at an equally modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next one.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or reach the career of both or may not have a major impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and served well in the first class, five Wickets and 40 holidays, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who is additionally, although in Australia he scored twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion following today’s training purely at Asirgyya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah’s greater experience over Bopar’s youthful lushness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparky and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class compared to six of Bopar, who is, at twenty-seven years younger, and has excellent anti-spin over-hours statistics.
However, Shah did in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his home pitch in Middlesex, just ten runs, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to take him back to the next match, his firing seems to have taken something from the Elane, which was so evident in Mumbai.
On the other hand, the Essex universe has Joie de vivre in its bones.
On the Cricket pitch, nothing lays him out, and his behavior outside of the field symbolizes a recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He got away with light injuries and probably shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored of course) and called Alastair Cook, his fellow player, who was watching it from a distance to ask him excitedly, “You saw it,”
Bopara is definitely better in the field, giving out its medium-speed shears on the local pitches that seem to suit him effectively and fires confidently and skilfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I tend to get Bopara my chance now, which, of course, I don’t want to say that Shah won’t excel if, as Cyclone tea tickets suggest, he’ll be the one who’s going to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday and to send out refugees who had run out of money or had expired the period of validity of visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight with the armed forces who have driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government regiment on a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Kubaisi, Sunni doctor.
“Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers because of what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
“They say Mahdi’s army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to Shia’s militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eight-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariya called him with the fact that a local domesticist with the support of the U.S. Army helped push al-Qaeda out of her positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shia tribes, whose home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, drove out a pomegranate attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
A few of my friends called and told me that he was starting a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and support from my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Al Obeidi, 20-year-old Sabaah.
Many have talked about the attraction of calming down in the capital after strengthening the US military presence and the growth of local “group of captured citizens”, which defends its fourth hand alongside the U.S. Army.
But more has been said to have caused them to return to visa-restriction and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, one-year-old father of three children, said aloud suspected by refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas and forced them to return.
More than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian murderers.
“It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving the Iraqis a visa to have to return to Iraq,” Sunni pensioners said.
“I can’t believe a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left.”
The partial reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunnis were pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will re-smelle the sectarian tension and lead to another struggle.
Petite Saarland, good education
Germany’s smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, and even excels in the international focus of its universities.
In only one educational area, Sária is concerned about the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
“A man who does not come from Saar, I explained yesterday after the 50th time that we are not French,” he said, “this self-ironic slogan appears in Saarland on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) at fifth place.
The universities have traditionally been working closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
What corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of Sarah children is admitted to college - many of them even without studying at high school.
“A professional education system is being used in Saarland,” says Axel Plünnecke, IW’s educational expert.
By obtaining more than one in five youths from a university, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany with regard to the population.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saudi Ministry of Education has now ordered colleges to create a promotional campaign for the engineering industry.
“After the first study of Pisa, we have carried out several reforms in general education schools,” said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal countries also take over.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, they will only show future comparative studies.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 %.
Overall, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal countries.
The Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of the Saarian study Pisa does not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarah might score in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory at the high school - although the inhabitants of Sarska are not French.

What not to see will go for hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez will move the clock in this South American country half an hour back.
In Spain, Chavez becomes a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela’s official letter said clocks would shift by less than four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American State will be a step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, has justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the United States to divide the time zones throughout the hours.
On Wednesday, Chavez announced that due to the case with hostages, he was suspending relations with neighboring Colombia.
This left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is the president of Colombia, he and the Colombian government will not maintain any relations with him.
“I can no longer, because of my self-esteem,” said Chavez, who advocates the reform of the constitution, which must be voted on by the citizens of this oil country in Sunday’s referendum.
With this reform, Chavez would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
Uribe's decision to take out Chavez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels to release hostages.
Uribe, by his decision Venezuelan-slipped into the face, criticized Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone is talking about Chavez.
“Por quo no te callas” (Why don’t you wait?) is a phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
It was voiced by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was so upset by the loud remarks of this leftist populist that he silenced him in this way.
German people are at risk of paying less in 2007
According to the forecast, German workers are at risk of reducing real wages this year despite a strong economy.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to Hans Böckler Foundation estimates, in 2007, employed people can actually count on getting lower wages than last year.
“The blame is a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy,” said Bild Gustav Horn of the Institute for Research (IMK) (Institut für Macro-Konomie und Konjunkturforschung).
A new burden on employees may also be waiting in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year is correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be able to fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from the federal youth, citing a newspaper of this socio-democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the price explosion of food and oil products has driven inflation to its highest state over the last thirteen years.
In the annual comparison, the total price increased by three percent.
Venus is the hell twin Earth
Throughout her life, Venus Earth is more similar than previously thought. The European Venus Express spacecraft in Venus recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and windy beliefs in the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus is shining.
Now the European Venus Express probe has brought evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the origin of primordial matter, life could have been created on Earth thanks to lightnings. Storms reportedly caused reactions in oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
“If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth and there are sometimes temperatures around 500 °C.
“Venus may be a hellish twin Earth, but he’s a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth, began to evolve differently is the fundamental question of the mission of Esa.
Since no spacecraft was sent exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which approached several articles in Nature magazine, did not just highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
“They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously thought,” said Esa.
In addition to the already known wind beliefs at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloudy faith at the South Pole, which revolves considerably faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents on the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrophisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with an average of 12,100 km, it is almost as large.
This planet, known as Tomorrow or Evening, orbits the Sun for almost 225 days.
However, around its own axis, it rotates much slower. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not recall a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar Earth, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water was accumulated on both sides, but it remained in the oceans on Earth, while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, Venus makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party's disputes for the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls on the great coalition to end the conflict around the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present ourselves outside as a nation that is not united on this issue,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed an understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
“Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me,” Köhler said.
Although the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent him from stopping Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not abandon China’s traditional single policy.
“China also knows,” said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his dissent to the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and has been attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the coalition’s “predictive” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the office of chancellors, German-China relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but SPIEGEL said it had also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministers of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions that are also located in the territory of China, is trying to separate themselves from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrests that broke out in France
Street battles with the police, shootings, inflamed cars, Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrests that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls.
The barricades were burning, the gunmen shot at the police, and after serious youth riots in France, the Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is concerned about similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful not to create such social tensions as will break out in violence.
“We have to take it seriously,” Neue Presse said in a Hanover newspaper.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, the countries and municipalities are already working hard to resolve the problems, Schäuble said.
This does not mean only the integration of migrants.
“From the Summit on Integration to the Conference on Islam, we are recording our first successes.”
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In recent nights, police youth in northern Paris' suburbs have been wagered by hard street fighting.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a “similar effect”
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should still be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 years old who come from migrant families, unemployment rate is - above average -
In particular, there is a need to provide a greater number of study opportunities.
He said, “We must give youthful hope.”
However, the President of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many migrant youths do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
He said, “But we have to be careful.”
We must allow young people to start working and learning quickly.
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and helicopters were flying over the area.
The authorised authorities reported three arrests and several inflamed trash bins and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 ordered forces have taken care of peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, after visiting the suburbs of Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie.
About 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the Toulouse riots took hold.
The accident sparked a Sunday car accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the State Prosecutor’s Office, the police are not guilty of the death of minors.
In the Kingdom of Angela - Cloud
The Chancellor’s reality is that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can expect nothing more from it.
In what country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her unsatisfied, indifferently sounding and content-poor speech at the General Debate of the Federal Council, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should ultimately manage.
Angela Merkel once responded with an arrogant phrase.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she didn't want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Federal Council, she clearly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserves that regret.
Merkel was not really interested, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela “Cloud” was presented: a policy that excels over others that flees into foreign policy, and there is only a foggy expression.
For example, climate protection: it is constantly praised for the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but it no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such self-praising - so much impeccability would have forgiven the CDU president two years ago.
It is now limited to plain phrases that could increase its popularity among people.
This approach harms her image of a pragmat who does not need to be proud because it solves problems.
But in the Angela-Cloud Empire, internal political problems are marginal issues.
Child poverty and low-wage people?
A few side sentences about these topics were left.
It is worth noting how often the Merkels, when it comes to child allowances, are talking.
Merkel must start three times from the beginning in order to express at least partially the correct sentence.
As soon as things become very concrete, they knock like in a completely alien terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate of Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, in the case of favourites, has dissipated Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney in a fierce debate - and both must now worry about the outsider's candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney announces to his opponent Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York a refuge for illegal immigrants.
Giuliani reacts quickly with sharp regrets: ‘I think his own house was just one such refuge,’ he answers and forsakes the former Governor of Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without documents.
As the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates use these CNN debates mainly to discredit their rivals.
Half-minute, internet-based users recorded and through YouTube the videos sent serve only as key topics.
“We have made it possible for Hitler to take power by this very policy of isolationism,” says John McCain, his opponent Ron Paul, who as the only one who advocates immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam's veteran McCain does not spare neither Romney, for refusing to condemn the torture method of questioning called \"Waterboarding\" in which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that there is neither war in Iraq nor torture methods among the important topics of the campaign.
The public is in awe whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney explains, and asks the party base and the TV audience to forgive for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express his literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharaf reigns in the civilian for the first time.
The day after his resignation from the position of commander-in-chief of the army, the Pakistani ruler, Musharaf, took the presidential oath.
That's the end of eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Parvíz Musharaf took the presidential oath on Thursday to remain in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast a live ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharaf swore that he would honor the Constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to his trustee Ashfaq Kiyanim, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in the bloodless military coup, the former general reigns for the first time as the civil head of the state.
With his resignation from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharaf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency declared by Musharaf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharaf's chief prosecutor, Musharaf's state of affairs will be abolished soon after his oath and will meet the other requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharaf, after declaring his state of emergency at the beginning of November, dismissed all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state in the last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military regiment in the North Vaziristan, and four others were wounded.
The military spokesperson said the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Father's Crusade is Back
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group recaptured their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band’s most successful period.
They were already more well known abroad.
The famous sensation then lies in the performance of three settled masters, who at first look like they just enjoy dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and above all buttons.
Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
On his left, he is 70-year-old Michael Roth, who has a laptop and a guitar ahead of him.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 37, which is concentrated on synthesizers, is from the viewers' point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by lack of sight, a traditional song will be created.
It doesn’t seem to bother the musicians.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, the revival of the band Harmonia sparked considerable excitement.
There is one thing worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is definitely not so over-the-counter that someone who has been painfully missing this band for twenty-three years.
But why can’t even Germany celebrate its ever-living 70s legends?
And especially when you’re in a musical style, mistakenly called Krautrock, in England and America, they value more than they value in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business was awarded the Echo Award for Life to the remaining members of the Cologne group, the hall was full of enticing views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! groups for their performances, the surprise of viewers no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Roth later sat on stage with them at Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
In the memory of Harmonia, this trio existed for only two years, and at that time it did not have the same influence that others later attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius have previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar of the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a turntable company run by the Church.
He briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but won the reputation as a guitarist for the band Neu!, who at that time may have been the most radical German band.
In 1973, Roth followed the musicians of Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, they lived as members of the community who fled the city.
They didn’t live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still able to hunt down as a nurse.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzwevian artistic being.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the singing choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was reportedly found in the ashes.
Many of this was preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was titled \"Music from Harmonie\" and the following \"De Luxe\"
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting roses was not just about self-recognition.
Now released on CD-Live 1974, the concert in Griessem was cut off from a record small, barely 50-member background.
Rotha then expressed his wish that the members of the Harmonie would be able to work out and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a very rude request.
In 1975, the band announced its breakup.
Roth ended up in an esoteric sphere and secured his future with an album “Hot Heart”
Cluster relived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
For a live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland has taken care of Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was then considered by Roedeli’s solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The British, Julian Cope, the old punk and the author of the manual, Krautrock Sampler, will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also participate.
This outlined the overall impact of Krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will fill in the Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s sentence accompanied by the most strange sounds is in the hall: “Unique true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are paintings in which the producer with Harmonia is in the peasant seat.
To create the legend, it also contributes to the screening of other black and white photographs, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again employed by improvisation.
By no longer gluing microphones to organes and drums, the instruments will break out of those never heard of self-made tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of the loss of the punchers.
There is no change to the body of the House of World Culture.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she sings emphatically -Aaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would have found the roots rather than in blues at the music colleges (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who cries out in this place, ‘68,’ is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not be allowed to come out of peace.
The most obvious thing on the scene is carefully thought out.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question of man either loses his nerves or allows him to experience the passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical.
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden released two films about the Balkan War.
But neither of them is convincing.
The film's template either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they're too touching.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop it at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzi and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere is acclaimed.
In recent times, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he has played in many kissy, unserious roles in well-being women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, he will take the appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument to watch The Hunting Party - where does the hunter become prey (Why must the names of the films today be so long and engulfed?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could become if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best years in a long time, but still retains a remarkable charm like a monument.
But despite this trumf, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters cinema this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, and one of them will fall in love with it.
Although it is praiseful that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television-stretched film is changing too soon into shooting and action.
There will be a lot of cobra 11 series left out of the film, without a highway, but with a war.
In The Hunting Party, we can see clearly why we haven’t done a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who are going to marry a \"Lixian\" Serbian top war criminal, could at another time and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (here both Richard Shepard) become a new \"Apocalypse\"
For both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is unable to do, but their path will become the way to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the shrewd and sentient cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the model also prescribes him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party has finally been released after reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film have managed to do what NATO, CIA and all the world’s criminals have failed in the last five years: catch criminals and leave him with a just revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court in The Hague.
This film has a deep human message.
It condemns that Karadzi and Mladić are still at liberty, and suspects Americans and French (that is where they are exceptionally united) that they do not engage in persecution on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women attack us famous Brecht's poem.
In it, it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer’s desk: ‘I look compassionately at the turbulent veins at the forehead, noting how hard it is to be evil.’
In films like The Hunting Party, exactly those inflated heads show how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were major failures.
One thing to add is that no good film about South Africa has ever been made.
It almost always applies: When a star breaks across a crisis area or walks around a mine field, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Borders of Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio will be created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, they had to run for decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films must seem to mature - films that are now considered classical Vietnamese works - \"Jewel Hunt\" - \"Apocalypse\" - or \"Follow Vest\" - were not in any way celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers do not have the ability to tell good stories.
“Being or not,” or “The Great Dictator,” after all, became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin had not yet known how the Nazi regime really ruled in a terrible way.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
He may have to create a sarcastic artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel, Lemprière's Dictionary, and the \"Balkan War,\" he said: \"The likeness is only in the fact that some things never change.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust to Criticise for Calling the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from the summer Olympics in Hamburg has come to a sharp critique of politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in an estimate of chances.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called this decision on Wednesday - from a business point of view - unfortunate -
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporty political enthusiasm to such a high degree,” he said.
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, which is based on a modified timetable.
The mayor of Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic by at least 2028.
“Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidate,” von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on the Munich Winter Games candidacy in 2018.
“This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance of having a 2028 time plan.”
This dream is not over yet, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) described von Beust’s statements as regrettable.
The impression is that Hamburg does not want to miss the Olympics in the next twenty-five years.
“It is still too soon to destroy our chances by marking plans as buried at this early stage,” HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The resignation would be contrary to the statement by the head of the Senate, which he spoke at the General Assembly of the General German Higher Education Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg’s candidacy at the University in 2015 as a substitute for the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg High School Sports Association only nominated for the candidate city last week.
The SPD faction in Hamburg’s Senate parliament said it was wasting valuable time to build apartments in Hamburg.
“The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been braked by the Senate for years because it has been betting on organizing the Olympics and building apartments,” said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook was still planning the Olympics, with the whole area being used for residential purposes later, the CDU unanimously placed on the ‘Olympic factor’.
Applying for the 2012 Summer Olympics gave rise to a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, has collapsed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
He who combines the terms of Sweden and the wooden crates does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes produced in Sweden are thrown into the list of Warhol’s work by dark shadows.
Most of its ninety-four-boxes, Stockholm-type, are counterfeits.
After Swedish newspaper Expressen, a few months ago, expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol’s Brillo boxes, from 1968, comes the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm with the result that brought disillusionment; six ‘Brillo boxes’, which in 1995 gave the gift to the Museum of Moderna Museet by its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other ‘Brillo boxes’, the type of Stockholm, which are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painting wooden boxes, which were based on the red-roasted design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works at Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but of their designs, merely exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo crates in Sweden, but they are not exposed in Moderna Museet.
The testimonies of the time now speak of fifteen crates, which rightly entered the art and auction history as the originals - \"Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy\" - with the designation Stockholm type.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $1000,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made in Sweden and exposed to approximately a hundred boxes, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén beds were made in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after his death.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator of Moderna Museet, explored in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968, and after their slide boards were painted with base paint and tableclothing, were painted with oil white paint.
On the other hand, from the copy structure of 1990, it was revealed that the paint was applied directly to the plywood board without a previous primer - in addition, it is acrylic and not oil color.
“These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol’s official Brillo Boxes,” said Moderna Museet’s director Lars Nittve: “If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not draw any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from his exhibition collections as ‘exhibitive material’ copies.”
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that they would deal with these “stricken accusations” that were raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
However, the organization remains in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
The Philippines gave up the rebel soldiers who fortified themselves at one hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The commander of the rebels Antonio Trillanes, who referred to the president’s manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he refused to be responsible for the bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government previously attacked with tear gas on the hotel.
About two dozen soldiers have been fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court because of a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his 30 sympathizers.
The military officers who were supposed to guard him apparently crossed over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.
“People have had enough,” Triallnes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit Scout Rangers said other troops would join the march in a short time.
Critics called for major demonstrations against the president on Friday.
For months, its government has been charged with corruption.
In 2003, the Manila financial area became the main event of a rebellion of about 200 soldiers against the Arroys.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have tried to overthrow the democratically elected government at least seven times in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
The United Internet has secured more than 20% of Versatel’s telecommunications business.
On Wednesday, the company announced that the average price per share was €14.46.
The company now owns 20,05 % of the share capital.
Before that, there was speculation about taking over.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its share in Versatel.
The United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Bereenberg increased its share of the network operator’s düsseldorf company by another 5% to 15.1%, there were entry estimates on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, the United Internet at Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks, already had almost 10% stake.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has given another 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million for sale.
Of these 5.15 million shares, he bought the United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperations in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” the spokesperson said.
In order to take over the competing company Freenet, the companies together established a joint venture of SMEs.
On Thursday, the United Internet announced that the two companies will be satisfied with a share of more than 10% in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of the company.
Companies are expected to keep all options open so far, especially the possibility of further increasing their share of Freenet AG.
The talks between the United Internet and Freenet on strategic partnership were closed in mid-November.
This long-lasting and difficult-to-clear game about Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections.
Holding the United Internet and Drillische had a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it was agreed that Drillisch would get about an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of Vatas’ investment company was agreed in August.
