The novice helped Trabzonspor to the second place, he also hit Škoda
Defender Filip Novák helped with a goal in the final round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-master.
His team won 2:1 at Kayserispor and held the third Besiktas behind him.
After a January transfer from Slavia, Milan Škoda already gave the 10th goal for Rizespor, who was saved, even though he died 1:3 on the course of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed excellent productivity on the defender with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor’s goalkeeper just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer at an angle fired the ball into the net.
The house managed five minutes before the end of the match, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute set of the set of the victory to his side when successfully finished the brejk four on one.
The pity in the introduction of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce leveled after the solo to 1:1.
Although Rizespore did not maintain the indecisive state for a long time, it did not have to be saddened, because thanks to the results of the opponents he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition will end on Sunday duel of Basaksehir at the Kasimpasy field.
The well-secreted Cave at the deserter's forest near New Bor was not actually habitable.
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lužice Mountains, near New Bor in the Czech Republic, in the forests led by the Count’s Road, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're going to follow the human hand created.
The place is called the Cave at the hermit.
In fact, however, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely a storage chamber apparently on grain.
The cave is carved from the side to the rock guard and accessible on the stairs from above.
At the end of the day, it is practically impossible to see.
It will be revealed to the narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where it is only entering the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human dwellings, at the time of its formation it could have been on a plateau where there is a forest, a field.
“The fact that this object does not have a window, nor does it show in the traditional location, that no hermit could ever survive the winter here,” explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the Faculty of Arts Jan Evangelista Purkyna in Usti nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench on the back, which is supposed to be used to store the vessels.
“I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field,” adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
Breaking the sandstone with the tipper was quite easy and fast for the dedicated.
It was enough to properly use the joints and sandstone to gradually break down.
According to the length of the track of the tipper and the method of mowing at all, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is openly accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest roads and take you under the caves of flowing coves and the nearby cove path, you will certainly find the path down.
And by the way from the forest you may still be caught by nearby Havrani rocks.
Jakoj Minařík is in an artificial sleep after a difficult fall in Germany
“Philipp is in the best hands now.
The Institute is furnished for similar cases, and luckily we have part of the family in Hannover.
This makes it much easier for me to see the situation and also care for the daughter of Finju,” said the server Jezdci.cz, a statement by Minařík’s wife Katji.
“Everyone is doing their best, Philip needs time to re-evaluate.
It makes no sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of trauma of the head and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all need to be patient and give him time,” said the woman of the forty-five-year-old.
He also called for the financial support of the wounded Minařík on Twitter and the star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race in Ascot on Saturday, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, leveling the legend of Lesser Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been collected on Gofundme.
The target is EUR 100,000 (2.6 million).
Video judge took footballers Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
The footballers of Sassuola, though in the Saturday game in Naples, were given four times the ball in the opponent's goal, but eventually they had to deal with the defeat of 0:2.
Neither of their goals was recognized by the referee after consulting the video because of the offensive.
According to Italian media, this is a record failure of technology, so many interventions have never failed one team.
“VAR was more stringent on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no other team.
“The new technology is breaking records,” Gazzetta dello Sport said in a statement.
-Festival of the unrecognized goals of Sassuola.
VAR has never been so strict on one team,” added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead in 8 minutes on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
However, Filip Djuricič's goal was not recognized after the video judge's intervention because of the offensive.
For the same reason, there were no further Djuricic's intervention and the traps of Francesco Caputa and Domenico Berardi.
They added another goal to the home.
Electric vehicles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they have been charging the most in history.
“The increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registration of new e-cars,” said Tomáš Chmelík, Head of Clean Technology Department.
Other major players such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric vehicle manufacturers, as well as Bill and Lidl supermarkets, also report their part on the market.
The operator of the classic gas stations is MOL.
But she doesn't have numbers yet.
“We only started building our electric mobility network last year,” spokesperson Jana Jusková explained.
However, the Journal’s editors have exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by CZECH.
Drivers from the stations received an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric vehicle.
If we miss a small pumping up to 1 kWh, it takes an average charge of two and a half hours.
The vast majority of the tanks then took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists had already paid for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 CZK.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of the most busy rechargers in the company, which will cover the entire regional cities with its popularity.
Olomouc runs between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border, such as Bohumína or Prachatice, which often remain untapped all day long.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year, there were 1274 new e-cars.
In an extensive poll, Czechs on the move, eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
Only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Ecological activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s previous actions on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more urgent approach.
The last drop was attended by representatives of major organizations such as the Duha Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
“For example, we have people who stand long-term against the expansion of the Turów mines, there are people who are opposed to the mining of the Štěrkopísk near the island of Hungary, there are people who oppose the construction of absurd dams,” said Marika Volfová, organizers.
She said the main demands of the protesters were the creation of a plan to retain water in the country, a dramatic change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies towards promoting sustainable agriculture, and a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy as quickly as possible.
“The government is supposed to defend the interests of people, not the ruthless and devastating business,” she said.
On Malostranské náměstí was placed a stand with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to plant on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
Present people were equipped with banners with passwords such as “The end of the beet depot” or “less coal, more brows”
From South Moravia to Prague Jan Škoda came from the Association for Water for People, which protests against the plan of mining gravel in Hodonínsk.
“It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people,” he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most powerful source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned mining of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to the opinions, it is certain that the quality of water will be compromised.
The so-called agroecological farmers came from the village Valeč in Karlovarsk Vojtěch Veselý.
He pointed out the pros of small farms that do not pay for income and profit and supply residents directly on the spot.
“Small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, but they do not make such destruction in the form of rural and environmental conditions,” he said.
In the fall of a plane to a house in Germany, three people died.
In the fall of an ultralight plane to an apartment house in West Germany, three people died today and two were injured.
This was reported by local rescue forces, according to which between the dead are probably two crew members and one resident of the house.
The plane fell on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, then caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
A local firefighter's representative, Robert Meyboom, said the two crew members had apparently died.
The third victim, according to the police, is the woman who lived in the house.
Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote that she was the mother of a self-sustainer whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with light injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which probably served as a brake when landing.
Police say it comes from a plane crash.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine started from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing an eye-witness, said the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed in the air before the impact on the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech Savings Agency incorrectly charged some card payments twice.
It has already removed the error
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna mischarged some card payments twice.
According to the spokesperson of the bank, Lukáš Kropík, the problem may have been about thousands of transactions.
The bank has already removed the error and returned the money to its clients.
Problems with double billing card payments were recorded by the savings company on Saturday afternoon.
“On Saturday night, we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to our clients.
At the moment, everything works without any problems,” Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients that the bank has deducted from card payments twice does not know the bank’s spokesperson, according to its estimate, was less than thousands of transactions.
The cause of the problem is found.
“This could be a combination of multiple factors,” said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings facility is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency degrees against coronavir on Monday.
“Stands will be at regional level according to the strength of community dissemination.
We are doing this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics,” Vojtěch said in a statement.
These will be so-called traffic lights, each region will be marked with a green, orange or red colour according to the risk of coronavir.
The minister added that he will talk about the inclusion of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that the orange color would currently only have the Moravian-Silesian region and would be nearing Prague.
The map will also feature individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
“We want to address this at regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform,” Vojtěch said.
Aquarius and Karolínka
When the watermelon Jonah and the miller’s daughter Karolínka look at each other, they are not easy at all.
Jonah’s father, the merciless waterman Hastrbuch, is in love, and Karolínka has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not a man.
Even though there is a young Libor who will do everything possible to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the waterfall.
How about he intrigues and lies?
Especially if she is able to reject Karolínka Jonas and prefer to him, the mighty Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone in the village who can, for the drowning of the night pot, spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other lotions.
The dismayed villagers will arrange a hunt for the water, and in order to do so, an unconvinced water curse will fall on Jonah’s head.
And now, the soul of Karolínce, go ahead!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studies of the CT and in the exteriors at the Brzin pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčany and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease is mild, only three percent of the infected have to go to the hospital.
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious hospital departments are semi-empty, although the numbers infected grow.
“This situation today and April is completely different, and it is mainly given to the number of hospitalized,” says health minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth reminding that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked with us, all of them were wearing gloves, the military carried out the subscriptions, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year ahead.
Ten people died every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19 die a maximum of two people.
The highest number of infected people still has Karvinia, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to the outbreak in local Alzheimer’s, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed by hygienists in Chernosice in Kralovehradeck.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
“We are traveling, we have limited movement, we have all hygiene measures,” says Martin Schánel, director of the pensioner’s home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home has yet to have symptoms of the disease.
Flat-screen testing will begin to carry out hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals also respond to an increased number of infected people.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which knows if people are wearing a cloth at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Czech hygienists who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavir - most of them are foreign employees of a dust company.
In total, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but less is being tested on the weekend.
The debut champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson's cream
The great surprise of a tournament called Dimitri van den Bergh also showed excellent performance in a fight with the player who won the second most prestigious firm within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was double-sided, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian arrowman.
Van den Bergh took the brejk with a 13 arrow leg and has been on top ever since.
With his opponent, he literally crushed his game, and much more experienced - Flying Scots - he hardly got to doubles.
The way he had it, the Creator of Dreams, in a handful, also testifies that he played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian mastered greatly high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the 11th leg, but - caught a big fish - and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson saw huge frustration.
The arrows were more like throwing away, and his triumph of walking opponent was completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of the three match gifts and received his name - he wrote his great dream.
The profit of the trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable for the Belgian arrowman that it is his first winning major.
Still, the last player to defeat van den Bergha is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, charges were filed because of the fire of the cathedral, the man admitted
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th-century glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Investigators have examined the suspicions of fire because of the fact that the fire progressed through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police did not find any signs that someone would get into the cathedral with violence.
The accused is a volunteer in the local diocese, a nine-year-old Rwanda refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without starting criminal prosecution.
Now, the prosecutor said on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessing and facing charges of starvation.
If he is found guilty, he is threatened with up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to fully cooperate with the investigator, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present the “semafor” for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, due to which the government and the Ministry of Health are faced with criticism.
“Stands will be according to the power of community dissemination,” the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a middle, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be imposed on each level, whether it is the obligation to wear a cloth or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan on the Prima Party TV programme, Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called on people to have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by saying that there is no major incident on the spot to talk about declaring an emergency status or re-calling a crisis crew.
In view of the increasing number of infected people since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has reintroduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government’s procedure, when it was not clear at the last moment what measures and when they would start to apply or when they would be announced, was criticized.
“I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main factors should, on the contrary, create a sense of certainty and, on the contrary, equalize the confusion,” Senator Marek Hilšer said in a statement.
The measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to wear clothes even in non-residential medical facilities, such as in pharmacies or in waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear clothes when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies was also introduced in Liberec and Ustice region on Friday.
In the highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear clothes in indoor public areas, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravian-Silesian region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region of Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government also approved the so-called ‘Sepafor for Europe’, which coloredly distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to the entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In countries with low and medium-risk risks, authorities do not require a negative test on the coronavirus after Czech citizens or instead do not order quarantine.
These are mandatory in returning Czechs from countries at high risk.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low risk category.
Technoparties are continuing to take place in Benesov.
Plays a third of the capacity, finishes at noon
The Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty near Hlaváčkovy Lhota in Benesovska continues on Sunday evening.
He still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the evening estimates, there are about 500 people left here after 20:00, original gross estimates were talking about three hundred, in the morning there were 900, police spokesperson Lucie Novaková said.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at that time a really part of the musical systems remained quiet.
Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still going on.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and disassembly of musical systems,” Novaková said.
“Policists are still closely controlling outgoing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breathing tests before leaving,” she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of police officers of the order unit, foreign police, traffic and order police are on site, and dogs with service dogs are also on standby.
“Today, police checked 470 people moving at the event site and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six were behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol,” Novaková said.
A total of 95 policemen tested for the presence of drug and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police have also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants, the technoparties conducted 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests for the presence of drug and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
On the TV program Prima Party, Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police assessed that no intervention was needed, and neither was asked by the sanitary station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television said on Sunday that the technoparties also extended to surrounding plots whose owners disagreed with the use of technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will require compensation for damage.
The supporters of the techna in the meadow at Hlaváčkovy Lhoty arrived on Friday evening.
The police initially guarded the meadow in Blažimi, Benesovsk, where the technoparties took place last year.
Blažem is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkovy Lhota, where the technicians eventually went.
According to Novákov, no one came to Blažima.
The girl is finished in the hospital!
“This year’s first case was recorded in Železnorudsk.
A girl in 2010 who was brought to the rescue service base by her parents, said the Regional Health Rescue Service spokesman Maria Svobodová, who later transferred the child to the hospital in Klatovy.
It is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Šumava that these animals occur in a higher number, so it is good to be careful when walking.
There is no danger from these animals.
The chance that he's gonna get away with you isn't too high, he's afraid when he's in normal contact.
And if he has room for it, he likes to wash away behind the loud saturation.
They will only attack if they feel much threatened - for example, when you accidentally click on it.
It is not a tragedy, but its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk is mainly for children, seniors and allergies.
“A person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals and especially allergic people, may experience anaphylactic shock,” she said.
The man threatened to throw the infants out of the window.
After the police officer lily wine and throw dishes
After 11:00 p.m., the intervention unit entered the apartment and arrested the men.
The infants were immediately taken into care by healthcare professionals, Regional Police spokesman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, he threw dishes after the police negotiator, knives, or watered it from the wine window.
During the negotiations, he strengthened his threats several times by leaning from the window with the child in his arms.
One day, he even went out on the window sill, where he was talking.
The police are still investigating the man.
He doesn’t want to publish more information yet.
Stosur will prefer her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not hit the season affected by the coronavirus this year.
U.S. Open 2011, who became a mother in June, does not want to finish his career.
The following year, he plans to return to the courts and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced two weeks ago on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to Genevieve’s daughter in mid-June.
“I’ll stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones our Evie will have in the next six months, and just enjoy it,” she said.
Since March, the WTA Tour will resume the season of August 3rd in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie Reveals Meat, Fish and Eggs of Unknown Origin
One of the vehicles entering the site transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to in inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in an assimilation plant,” the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the stand with live fish, it was found that the seller had no evidence of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The marketplace is considered problematic from a veterinary perspective for a long time.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians revealed an illegal food store, with nearly half a ton of unlabeled foods without evidence of origin.
Most could not determine the date of consumption, some products had a shelf life and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians with police officers detained 80 kilograms of food in the marketplace without evidence of origin, including dried fish, oil or frozen ducks, some of which were fungus.
Putin called Zelensky before launching the ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due from midnight.
Putin, according to a statement by the Kremlin, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday evening, Ukraine and Russia negotiated a new peace of arms with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to begin after midnight on Monday, to be “complete and general,” and to open the way to the fulfilment of the other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin said in an interview with Zelensky that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections was contrary to the Minsk peace agreement and threatened the prospect of settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament decided that the upcoming elections to the local embassies would not take place in the territory controlled by the pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of the Ukrainian lands of the occupied separatists with Russia after it gives these regions broad autonomy and arranges local elections.
The Green Office said the two states agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as the reward of combat areas or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop fighting, but in occasional shootings and artillery attacks, people die on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made the end of the war in Donbass a priority, but there has not yet been a major breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected champion in the ten is Rykl, the seven-boiler was mastered by Novotná.
Defender of the last two titles Doležal did not arrive at the end of Saturday's program of four hundred, Kopecki did not jump the foundation in the bar on Sunday.
Teniboji was ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the discussion.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside of the Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only ten-fighter who got over a seven-thousand-long border.
Another medal was won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
“It’s a shame that there weren’t guys here and the Kope didn’t set up, because the results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a person 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed about the disc, I was below average,” he said on Facebook.
On the first day of the seven-stroke she won with more than one-hundred-point predominant Katerina Bach, even though she was hit by a wounded ankle on a reflective leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, it only entered 570 cm, it did not move 40 meters into the final eight-cylinder.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Katerina Dvoráková.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
“I really wanted it to be around 630.
Yesterday I started to pull a nail, but I’m very glad I didn’t feel it at all and that it didn’t limit me at all,” Novotná said on Facebook.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
The liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its substantially lower price than gasoline or diesel, which is significantly lower in excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per mile.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has an environmentally friendly variant - \"bio LPG\"
However, it is quite new - on the European market first appeared before and to the Czech Republic according to a press release of the Czech LPG Association arrived a few days ago.
“In these days, we have received the first 15 tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol stations in a mixture with classical fossil LPG,” said Jiří Karlík of Primagas.
However, Bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, on the chemical side it is identical to the classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists are now tanking into their cars.
It is also possible to mix both versions freely.
“The only difference compared to classical LPG is the way of production,” says organic LPG Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association.
This is also known as one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, as well as the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
On the other hand, classical petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the technology of production and the source of operation of the car on bio LPG, it is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation of the petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, that is, the so-called part -well-to-tank - (Czech - from source to tank -)
Some of the largest bio LPG manufacturers currently include petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan on Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also explores the production capacity of its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic there are about 170,000 vehicles on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment mentions a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, nearly 6,000 car renewals for LPG were carried out only last year.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected people, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for YES) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavir virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number fell from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer infected.
Currently, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
“Behind the rapid increase in the number of cures, data revisions that have not been able to be updated recently,” said Jaroslav Dušek, Head of Health Statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people were infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 recovered, and 371 Covid-19 diseases failed.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence elections.
Politician and sociologist seeking variants for the period of the pandemic
In October’s regional and Senate elections, people in quarantine for coronavir are required to change the law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday at the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties.
“Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law,” Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution to the current statutory rules.
However, the minister said it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of the state of health.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM program stated that the possibility of correspondence elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of YES or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overvalued.
It is then against the possibility of an electronic vote, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The corresponding choice (whether in foreign or also in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
As another one, he sees the electoral units mentioned above or, for example, the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the coronavirus - were addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus infections, various types of elections in 67 countries have been postponed this year.
Buharsk protests: Pig's ears throw demonstrators at government building
The protesters against Prime Minister Bojek Borisov and his cabinet were placed on a pig’s ears government building.
It was another number of protests against the “Mafia style of governance” that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a national blockade at the center, DPA said.
Today’s protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, was a weaker participation than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom.
About 300 people met at 8:00, some of the streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the government’s building played a theatre scene in which they symbolically closed the prison cell of Prime Minister Boris and General Prosecutor Ivan Gešev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests of Nikolai Hadjigenov said on public radio that on Wednesday there is a “top escalation” in the form of a “national demonstration in Sofia and blockades across the country”
He repeated the demand for Boris’s resignation and his government, as well as for early elections.
They are expected to take place in March 2021.
Borisov said earlier that he was not going to resign.
This was justified, among other things, by the need to carry out Bulgaria’s Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday, he exchanged five members of his government team, although he did not calm down the demonstrators' concessions.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov’s government ceased to vote on Parliament’s confidence.
Boloni Mihajlovich does not want matches without spectators
Football coach Boloni Siniš Mihajlovič already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes the fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
What we are currently doing is not football.
I've got my teeth full of matches without spectators.
It's sexless football, it's no emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks so,” said Mihailovich before the game against Lecce.
After the coronavir pauses follow the matches of Series A in a fast track, and although they are played only in the evening, their players are exposed to heat.
“We play every three days in a terrible heat.
In such conditions, you will not even know how the teams are at it.
So this season is over.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope the fans will be back from September,” said Fiorentina and AC Milan.
For Mihailovich, this season is unusual because four months on the bench are missing due to the treatment of leukemia.
“Despite my illness, the break of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move the level higher.
“We want to grow further and we need players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of a cyberattack of foreign countries, Iran says
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials said the fire that broke out this month in an underground nuclear operation in Natanza could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters that Islamic Republic infrastructure is facing thousands of cyber attacks every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them can be reflected.
In recent months, Musawi said several larger cyber attacks were recorded, behind which, according to analysis, there were “certain governments and groups”
However, more details about possible perpetrators were not reported by Reuters.
Musawi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
Iran's state agency IRNA said Iran's enemies, like Israel and the U.S., could face recent incidents this month.
None of these countries, however, were accused of any specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensioned relations between the two countries have escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. Army killed Iranian General Kasem Soleimani on January 3 and a member of the leadership of the Iraqi militias Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
On January 8, Iran fired at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, a number of missiles.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been injured.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which is denied by Iran.
TPCA extends production downtime, now until 25 May
The Cologne automaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has renewed production downtime due to coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday 25th May in the morning.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, automaker Tomáš Paroubek said.
Production is due to the coronavir pandemic since the evening of March 18.
Originally, the company planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the downtime is according to Paroubek closed borders and closed dealership, so the cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is affected by key markets of companies such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA is not signed on to life in the city.
From the beginning, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are being filled, especially now that Monday, when it has been very loose.
So the city is full,” said Kašpar.
He said there were no complications with foreign workers who stayed in the hostels.
“In the last two months, we didn’t have to solve a problem,” said Kašpar.
For example, the Mladoboleslavská Škoda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavir crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works 100% of the capacity.
The restoration of production in Scotland was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, there was a third night shift in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasíny for the first time after the restoration of production.
At TPCA, about 2,500 people are currently working and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer Kills Bride Shortly After Wedding: Leave a Message to Family
For more than two years, she had been struggling with insidious cancer, and when she seemed to have defeated cancer, the disease came back.
A 19-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospice bed, where she still had enough to marry her love of life.
Unfortunately, the disease died.
A few hours after his death, a shocking message appeared on his Facebook account for the closest.
Gema Sisson from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With a friend, Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for over 16 years, they traveled through competitions all over the world.
A 19-year-old woman sported and lived healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to heal.
After months of treatment, Gemma seemed to have won cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the information of the British daily mirror, underwent a ten-hour surgery on the spine and then started drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her nineteenth birthday, doctors told her that she had a few months left to live.
In April, a handsome blonde eventually decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every moment, which even arranged her for a wedding with her love Ricky.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, she died in his arms.
Just a few hours after his death, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema wrote for her family.
“If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who was at my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on the social network, adding that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
“I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network,” she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their lives and live it fully.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, fungus amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, he will receive the passing pocket work of mostly beginner Czech artists.
Images and other creations create directly for artmat, so they know that they must fit into the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself, - specified the curator of the project Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
Thus, the buyer can be surprised at what kind of work he will get.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra Stockholm or the mini-views from Teresa Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutková prepared a pexeso associated with a walk Prague.
Cards must be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chomová sell a pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a troupe and a fiduciary card, the second series of illustrations based on her comics by the Spiritist.
Health pay will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
The increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch.
Salaries in healthcare could increase by up to five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for YES) in the questions of Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The requirement of trade unionists to increase by up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in securing protective devices.
Hospitals now have their supplies.
“I think the increase (wages) can be up to five percent somewhere,” the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March it has interfered with the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread.
The insurance companies’ income fell at the time.
“I think 15 percent of the increase is unreal at the moment,” said Vojtěch.
The average monthly earnings of the doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) will probably reach 88 312 CZK this year, sisters 47 498 CZK.
The difference between nurse’s salary in state hospitals and wages with other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34 125 in 2019 according to the Czech Statistical Office data.
Trade union officials said in June they would demand a minimum increase of 10%, ideally 15 percent, by 2021.
They criticize the long-standing difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals that must be guided by pay tables and contractual wages in hospitals of cities, regions or private ones.
Therefore, they also require that the salary tables be uniform to health care professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, in doctors last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unions should see how the state is at present.
The House recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion due to the effects of the Covid epidemic, of which 1,75 billion are due to be paid to health care professionals in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the Council of health care providers disagrees with the flat-rate salary increase next year.
According to him, they should decide on the remuneration of hospitals themselves and medical facilities, and extra money should go to them through the payment decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
President of the State Material Reserve Administration (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently own a single protective medical device.
He is waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were redeemed.
The state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
A crushing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they're talking.
“Smart quarantine works, there is something to improve, of course.
We're going to talk to the military tonight.
The army works perfectly, and the question is whether they should run it all again,” the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook program Hey People.
According to him, it is not possible to connect IT systems and sanitary stations enough, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister of the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek said he did not have information about Sunday’s negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this move.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, a smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body of the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The crushing project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He also said he could be taken back by the army.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by a government IT and digitization agent Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
“The system works, but it’s still working on.
Twenty years ago it was created independently and unsystemically, now we are trying to unite it in a few months.
It's not a jet.
People on the march, poor people on the hygienes during the march adapt those new systems and actually catch the mistakes,” he said.
The Mayor of Ostrava, Macura, will not be running again, because he does not want to “grow in politics”
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason for this is to “do not dig into politics,” said Respect.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the president of the ANO movement, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
“I said I’d be able to hold on to one term of office, and with that business experience, I’d be able to turn everything around and put it on my feet,” he said.
He added that he was allowed to speak for the second term to some extent.
“But it’s the maximum for me.
I don’t want to be stupid about that policy,” Macura added, who in an interview called himself a heavy introvert who doesn’t have frequent contact with people.
According to the Respect, there has been speculation about Macur's possible end in the YES movement for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the YES movement, for example, for alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few figures, YES supported the election of Zeman’s anti-candidate Jiří Drahoš.
He is not planning to leave the YES movement he joined in 2017.
“As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it’s not a total wasteful struggle, and that no one is caffaring me, I have no immediate motive to end it,” he said.
Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was, among other things, the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also met in the organs of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
At the end of July, Uber will return to Brno, which offers transport services.
This is the result of a change in the law, said Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) in a press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber did not meet conditions such as a taxi or a taxi meter.
Since July, however, the conditions for running normal taxis and alternative taxis have changed.
In the last few weeks, he has had several meetings with Uber representatives.
On their basis, this company decided to return with its services to Brno at the end of July of this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city has been aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits,” Kratopín said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking vehicles as a taxi or a missing taxi meter.
The court issued a preliminary measure prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno was originally supported by taxi drivers, but last year Mayor Markéta Vanková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later rulings, Uber was able to ride in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return under the law.
As of July, next to the classic taxi with a luminaire and a taxi meter, it is easier to operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too quirky celebration in Brno: flying chairs hit a meter from a man on the pavement
On the fourth floor of the apartment, an office chair flew on Saturday night in Brno and reached about a meter from the pavement.
At that point, a walker went after him, who immediately called the guards.
The patrol immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city noticed an open window, under which there were still chairs and a few cans and bats next to it.
“The ruch, which was carried from the room on the fourth floor, indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The guards went out to the apartment and asked three young men present from the age of twenty-six to twenty-nine for an explanation,” said a spokesman for the police officer Jakub Ghana.
Request for appeal Rafael discusses Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss on Monday with coalition social democrats the demand for the appeal of the head of the antitrust office (UOHS) Peter Rafaje.
The non-profit organizations called for the appeal of Rafael at the meeting of the anti-corruption council of the government, as well as the Ústek Region.
Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to ČTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of next year, according to the law it cannot be appointed for the third time.
His appeal is under the authority of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústecké Region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Rafael’s recent case.
In the last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request that the materials would be familiarized and that the government parties would be interested in this - some opinion -
He also said that he had not yet dealt with the president, and that he did not have an appointment with him in the near future.
According to ÚOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafael was not accused of anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktunalne.cz last week wrote that the police are interested in Rafaj's meeting with the captain Jiří Čunk.
The meetings included a controversial new hospital for eight billion, which Čunek strongly advocates.
He admitted that he had been working together for his “Senary Activities”.
The same is true of Rafael.
The U.S. government called on the government to appeal Rafael at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision on public contracts according to the Deputy Director for Transport, Jaroslav Komínek, is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police interfered with the antitrust office due to a toll-picking tender.
This June, the server Aktualne.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written on the company of influential behind-the-scenes player Alexander Čuba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million to the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
The president of the Office for the Protection of Competition has been Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the president of the former Social Democracy Member appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafael’s second six-year term expires.
The Antitrust Office Act states that the President may revoke the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may only be withdrawn if it does not perform a function for more than six months, or if it seriously distorts the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Brno library, employees collapsed with heat.
It will help air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
“It’s good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in the centre of Blanska regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stand there.
There was terrible heat and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That’s why I like air conditioning,” said one of the Blanec readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library of Lukáš Dlapa, temperatures in the building often climb up to 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glassed and on sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
In addition, the sun is based on a large part of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, a large problem is the individual department to ventilate, because overnight the window must be closed for security reasons.
“We often have that in the library at 30 degrees since morning,” Dapa said.
The worst part was the studio and reading room on the third floor.
And at the height of the exhibition room and the director.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
“Sometimes it happened that librarians were collapsing at work and ended up in inability to work.
The problem has also occurred regularly in a cultural room at lectures that are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, we couldn’t breathe there,” said Dnapa.
Originally, the city’s representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all the premises of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three tracks out of five.
Due to limited financing, air conditioning will have only the most problematic areas.
Studio and reading room on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and the children’s department on the floor above,” informed Jiří Svoboda of the Blanenian Investment Department.
He added that in the first stage, workers had already installed air-conditioning in autumn in the above mentioned areas and modified the electrical installation.
About 360 thousand crowns.
The City Library of Blansko has almost 3,000 registered readers.
It's about nine hundred and fifteen years old.
Chicago has driven out the coronavirus.
“Crawford is back in the game.
Not every one of the infected athletes will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent as a grave about the health status of players and do not publish anything at all.
He was one of the few of the few out of the field.
A 35-year-old native from Montréal was present only at the first training session, and since then he has been missing in the assembly.
“I would like to tell you all that I’ve been tested positively on Covid-19 and that’s why I’ve spent the last 14 days locked up in my house,” he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
\"Crawford is ready to be thrown into full load again.
“It’s amazing that I’m back.
I will do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible,” he added.
An experienced goaltender with Chicago won two Stanley Cups, a solid part of the goaltender's already 10th season in a row.
Blackhawks will first wait for a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in front of them.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tackles the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place before Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahu because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government solves the next wave of coronavirus epidemic.
“Bibi, go home,” wrote one of the demonstrators to his banner, referring to Netanyahu’s generally known nickname.
“Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his dress,” he said.
Netanyahu is Israel’s first prime minister to hold office.
She is accused in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process can last up to three years, over 300 witnesses are called.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, has been confirmed by nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died of the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce daily increases in infected people.
However, after the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, especially at the end of June, numbers of infected people began to grow significantly again.
Netanyahu’s critics claim that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, tradesmen affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also concerned that the government issues conflicting instructions in the fight against coronavir.
The driver broke the car by a tree and died.
The body must have been cut off by firefighters.
The tragic accident occurred at around 23 p.m. near Neveklov in a narrow district leading from the Slapská Dam.
The driver flew at no speed down into the woods and broke the car by a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body was forced out of the wreck by firefighters, among other things they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are checked by the police.
They ordered a court pitting to clarify, among other things, whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
End of wasting and squeezing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and embark on a major change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to spoil one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the largest environmental pollutants is not new.
Incinerators and landfills, billions of clothes end every year.
The view of slow fashion, often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite rapidly in recent years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The second half, sold by discounts, simply won’t buy.
The company does not want to spoil one collection after another and at the end of each season, the products will be discounted below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mička, the era of new and old collections and blind follow-up of fast-changing fashion trends are gone.
Most merchants already count discounts when buying goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
It’s actually a bit of a scam,” says Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, with its approach, the company also wants to support local business.
Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and over-seasonal.
Worldwide, the premium brand segment is the absence of any discount typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary,” adds Mica.
The Giant Graffiti is the RAF fighter Kurt Taussiga
The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal liked the city’s leadership,” said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive creation.
It used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to the internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
He and his brother, however, managed to avoid a concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig entered the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), then underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times, as well as his native state, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, who has been known as Camo by the street art industry for over 20 years, has been working spraying in the thermal streets.
It began with the Graffiti on the surfaces that then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) had dedicated for these purposes.
Hanna's Storm Arrives to Texas Coast
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the south-west coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight SELČ on the night of today).
He hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened the tropical storm over the mainland.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a major danger to coastal residents.
It brought strong wind and intense precipitation; along with local floods, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported by AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster on Saturday for 32 districts in the southwest of Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warnings were received by people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the element has an almost 500 km long territory before it gradually moves over northeastern Mexico.
“Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, a dangerous blow and a unique tornadoes can pose a threat,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
This morning, the local time (SELČ afternoon) was in the US-Mexican border area, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by a wind of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but gradually weaked to 112 kilometers per hour in the course of the course of the course of the mainland.
The local authorities called on the storms to survive at home and not to forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of coronavirus spread.
Texas is one of those states in the United States that suffers the most from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Due to existing security measures and the need to comply with the distances, they are a major challenge and possible evacuations.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test on the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to infection.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated people to take their clothes and disinfectant gels with them if possible.
“We don’t have it far behind us yet.
We are expecting catastrophic floods,” said Chris Birchfield, AP, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Predictions claim that in some places it could rain up to 300 millimetres of precipitation within a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which together with the turbulent sea level could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman to lend general rank to Colonel Lipko
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank of Colonel Pavel Lipko on Wednesday.
It follows from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the rank of the Brig-Gen is the August arrival of Leipzig to the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division of the Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still acts as a representative of the commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
At the end of June, Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brig-Gen Karl Řehk as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division of the Northeast in Elblag, Poland, who commands troops of the Alliance’s pre-deposited presence in Poland and the Baltic.
In March, he became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NUKIB).
The government has proposed that Lipka lend the rank of the Brig-Gen to the president.
Under the Law of the Soldiers of the Occupation, the higher rank of the soldier may be borrowed for the period of exercise of the elected function or for the duration of the performance of a service task which requires the lending of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been lent has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the rank.
The lending of the rank is pending the reason for which it was granted.
Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
In a significant way, he is involved in the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations,” the Ministry of Defense said in June.
Wednesday’s promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. in Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
EU countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the distance or wearing of the clothes on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
It was reported by Reuters.
“I am pleased that my colleagues adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards,” Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be enough fresh air on aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to accommodate the middle seats.
The common rules agreed upon by officials meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
A temperature record fell on the Arctic Spicy, they measured almost 22 degrees there.
“A 41-year-old record fell in Longyearbyen,” the Norwegian Meteorological Institute tweeted.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, which exceeded the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spicberky, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spicy is warmed faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming other ends of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
The average temperature in Špicberky increased by three to five degrees from the 1970s.
By 2100, it can rise by ten degrees if greenhouse gas discharges into the atmosphere are not reduced.
The rise in temperature in Spicbers can result in the melting of eternally frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause more lava and landslides.
Climate change also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as icy bears or seals, who are dependent on ocean ice cover.
The British who return from Spain awaits a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that are not necessary due to the risk of spreading the disease.
Thus, the Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain,” the British diplomacy said in a statement.
“We have always made it clear that, if necessary, we will remove a country immediately from the list of safe ones,” she added.
As noted by the British Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a popular holiday destination.
The British have concerns, among other things, whether they will be paid sick if they have to end in isolation for 14 days after their return from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne ordered a ten-day vacation to Lanzarote, and they had a flight on Tuesday.
The tour has been ordered since December.
“We should have been going to the whole family, my wife Amanda and Bethana’s daughter, but to be honest, I don’t know what’s going to happen after this announcement.
“I work as a mechanical leader and I don’t think my employer will come up with the fact that I will be quarantined for two weeks after I return from my leave,” said Metro Hunter.
In connection with Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemic.
Over the last two days, over 900 newly infected people have always been there in 24 hours.
Offices in some areas are already strengthening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has recently pointed out the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, Basque and Madrid.
The model of electricity redemption from Dukovan will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new Dukovany nuclear power plant.
The bill states that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the effect on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for the customer.
Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for YES) and the energy company CZECH have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save money on electricity thanks to construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook of electricity prices in markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
It was previously criticized by environmental organizations.
The purchase price can be both below the market price of power electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption, - the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the documents.
Havlíček said in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would grow and people would make money on the Dukovan building.
Otherwise, the impact will be in tens of crowns per year for the family, which he believes is far less than people annually pay in invoices for electricity to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the ransom price could range between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, it is to be concluded only in the contract for redemption.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders are now the most stockpiled, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
“With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, average household payments of 3.3 MWh per year could be the equivalent of four-member households, standardly equipped with electric appliances including electric hobs and ovens, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - less than 100 CZK/year,” the government said in a statement.
We live in a very turbulent time.
The coronavir pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be an explicitly speculative issue,” said Tomáš Voltr, CEO of the Energy Financial Group.
The proposed law assumes that the redemption would be carried out by an MPO, or by an authorized legal person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The agreement between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, but not limited to the termination of low-carbon production operations.
The low-carbon production design defines as a nuclear power plant connected to the electricity system with a minimum power capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček had previously stated that the new bloc should have a power output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to the 10-yearly expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The funding model for the new Ducovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the facility at interest-free cost, with a 2% interest in operation.
The funding model does not agree with the opposition, it is also concerned with the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should account for 70 percent of the construction.
The rest should be paid by CZECH, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
In May, ČTK, the CEO of the Czech Republic, said that the expected amount for building a block at the current prices was around €6 billion (approximately €162 billion).
Contracts between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of the new Ducovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Local Development withdraws two billion-billion-dollar tourism support material
The material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on the media, on the Internet and on billboards for advertising holidays in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn from the reference procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) of the server ListZravy.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in the eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by the server Zdprawty.cz.
The plan was justified by the decline in tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavir crisis, income and media declines occurred.
The proposal raised criticism from both the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now to be viewed on the site hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money for advertising on televisions, radios, press, internet, billboards or stations through the state tourism agency CzechTourism.
The largest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would receive television.
Most of them would receive private television Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weekly newspapers would get 400 million and the same part would give MMR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
The radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at stations or in the subway.
The tourism campaign in the Czech Republic was expected to start in mid-August and last for a year.
“The material is still working on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented,” Dostálová said without further details of the List of Messages server.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of the TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrei Babiš (ANO).
“I firmly believe that this great contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn election,” she tweeted.
In fact, it is about helping the media affected by the crisis.
“It may be a coincidence, I don’t know anything about media support,” she said on Friday.
The budget is two billion oriental.
Of course, we still count it, it can be less or more.
It is a work material,” she added.
The initiative to save tourism does not give a media campaign to support home tourism.
“We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign,” said Tomáš Barčík, president of the initiative on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative is written in an open letter to the government.
A broth of life, a cock of beer and death like a wall of grass
Afterlife is also the third album titled A Death is a steblo of the grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left the year before May 24.
In Frič’s discography, it is the fifth item and, like previous titles, here is the main emphasis on Frič’s poetry, which is itself an excellent performer.
Frič, 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was pasted through his own, personalized experiences and also very inner manifestations of faith.
However, there was some kind of aggression on the chases, if he spoke or wrote about faith, God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), a master's pardon.
Frič’s album offers records of the author’s readings of 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Key, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - like - the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic songs.
“They were made proud and endlessly bitter,” writes Hruška, “above the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into obstinate consumer prodigy and rarity, is increasingly relinquishing from what his soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human proximity.
There was a stoic of those who knew that the values for which it was created few were interested, but who also knew that only because of the general lack of interest could they not be abandoned.
The poems reminded us that one might have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how one loses it.
If he sells himself to general decline, scepticalally resigns, silences himself, or remains in the last moment in a quiet and proud duration on what he believes and loves.
\"Parubek is not my advisor,\" Hamáček said.
The former Prime Minister and Chairman of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid advisor to social democracy.
The President of the Party and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamak said that on the Prima Party TV show today.
The fact that Paroubek should be a Hatzak advisor was informed on Friday by the server ListZravy.cz.
“We write an essay from time to time, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it,” Hamáček said today.
However, it is not an official and paid cooperation.
In his view, the CISSD does not have the means to waste it for similar purposes.
“The fact that I read his opinion sometimes is so many,” he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the Minister said that many members of the ODS are still “indiscriminately listening to the views of Václav Klaus”
It’s okay because it’s an experienced politician and a former party president, which is also the case with Paris.
The fact that the media is making it an affair, he called it a sign of this year’s cucumber season.
The server ListZravy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Haazka’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that former chairman Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek, is headed to the fourth place of the party’s candidate in the Russian region, and served as the vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, he's a kick in the ass, he's a poor Swedish challenger
The 22-year-old American stick has the ambitions and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, and last year he was overwhelmed by the NCAA University Association.
“We had a battle a year ago, then he won, and I was the second, then we went through it.
In both cases, it was a very good fight,” Nilsen describes, who secured the victory by a 5.95 meter.
But since then, Duplantis has fired a steep upwards and is now alone in the highest barbaric spheres.
In just twenty years he became a world recordman, this February 8 in Torun he crossed a bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added a centimetre.
“He jumped six meters as early as 18 when he graduated from high school,” said Nilsen’s peer for World Athletics.
“It was clear that once he grew up from a boy in a man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record, he thinks.
Although the Nilsen record of success is thinner than the one proud of Duplantis, the American sets similar goals.
In February 2017, he improved his personal record to 5.93 m. In August, he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, where he finished 13th in 2017.
The next milestone is to try the Diamond League for the first time.
“It is definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name,” he realizes.
“When you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympics, World Championships or Pan-American Games.”
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other poles time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into just a fight for silver?
“Everyone is trying to reach him, but I don’t think it will be possible in the near future,” Nilsen said.
“This boy has been jumping for 16 years and he’s got a mile lead in training.
And before Tokyo 2021, he'll want to increase it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of her disabled son's pension.
The Court of Justice
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman has eight years in prison.
Because of his ill health condition, he deprived the sick man of his own right, and his mother appointed a caregiver, who, among other things, was to manage his son’s money.
“A woman from mid-November 2013 to this January used some of her son’s disability pension funds for her own needs, and she took it for $440,000,” police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said in a statement, saying that the accused person was under a special duty as a guardian to defend the interests of the injured person.
The woman, according to the court order, set up an account for her son, but her pension was sent to her account.
“After paying the costs associated with the son’s stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electric appliances and to run a household,” he said.
That she can't use her son's money for her need, the woman admitted.
But she fought by helping them pay for family expenses.
“We had problems with our incomes to slow down the running of the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It’s always been for things my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
“I didn’t know I was going to commit a crime,” she told the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been populated for 30,000 years, according to scientists after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in Zacatecas, Mexico, include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as hubs or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the tools came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here,” said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas, and the lead author of one of the two studies published in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite caves, located at a high altitude, have been inhabited for 20 000 years.
So far, widely recognized theory has been that first representatives of Homo sapiens have crossed the mainland bridge from today’s Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique tippings used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this human culture has subsequently spread to a large part of North America.
However, this model has received cracks in recent decades, when several ancient settlements, which were two to three thousand years older, were discovered.
In a second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different locations across North America prove human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland before it was thought.
Some of them could get ships to America.
“It is clear that people in America were long before the development of the so-called ‘Clamic culture’,” said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada.
The interest in flights is still filled with an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are gradually decreasing.
Flight sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
As opposed to last summer, the interest is still about half, but demand is growing by as much as 20% every week.
The development after the crisis thus, according to the sellers, fulfils the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of tickets are gradually decreasing.
The most sought-after destinations are, in particular, South European countries.
According to the data Kiwi.com lead Spain, Italy and Greece.
At Letuska.cz, flights to Split are the most sold.
From other countries, the UK is the most sought after, but it was always one of the most busy destinations.
The average ticket price is also reduced.
At the portal Letuska.cz, about 6250 CZK was around the middle of the month, year-on-year by 3000 CZK less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices have also fallen to some European sites, such as Spain or Italy, in recent weeks, by about one-fifth.
The crisis also affected the behavior of customers who are now buying tickets with much less advance than before, as they are concerned about the further development of the coronaviral situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of the ticket before departure decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
“This confirms a future trend in which people will order tickets in a much smaller way, they will require more flexibility, less risk,” said Michael Shindelár, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is increasing.
There are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
The summer season is about half of the destinations.
Great finale tonight!
Watch the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has come to a big final.
Experienced 29-year-old Scottish arrowkeeper Gary Anderson and surprise tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson in the first round out Justin Pipe, then hit his neighbor on the table ladder.
However, James Wad and his fourth-finals match with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home a world-leading number one.
\"The flying Scots - he was in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the tomb from the blade, dominated in the extension and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he already ruled in 2018, when he defeated Mensura Suljovich 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The world's biggest matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and perhaps knowing that it has nothing to lose, has helped him play on a totally fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old arrowman first surprised Nathan Aspinall’s world six, and in a dramatic battle, Jo Cullen, and in the quarterfinals, Adrian Lewis, too, fought.
A big test was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the beginning, but in a calmly-playing Belgian, the excellent series took the lead, which then held more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scores, which he faced with occasional uncertainty in doubles.
Cases of coronavir have increased since at least the beginning of the week, reduced the number of tests
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been demonstrably infected.
Nearly 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are ill.
This is based on data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times in a row two hundred.
Maxim was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, 235 were tested, 246 before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have been cured of covid-19, 63% of all previously infected people.
In most cases, the disease had a mild course.
According to the Ministry of Health’s recent data, 151 people with coronavir are in the hospital, and 19 of them are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, per 100,000 inhabitants, still report Karvinia, almost 59.
Following is the Jihlava district with 56 and Frýdecko-Mietsko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, a new measure against the spread of coronavir has been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear clothes at internal mass events over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been demonstrably infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded the limit of 16 million.
Johns Hopkins University, which tracks the development of the pandemic globally, said.
The balance of victims who died of covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand, according to the source.
The latest million infected came into statistics in just three days; the 15 million limit fell on July 22.
In recent days, the United States, which have already registered more than 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, has infected nearly 1.4 million people.
The infected are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced this week that there have been more than 284,000 new cases worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
These developments can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top in the populous states, such as the USA, Brazil or India, but the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world over the past week.
This includes Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The infection has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case has been officially reported by the North Korea.
Home air is five times worse than outdoors.
Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
Israel's health expert Carol Abraham has already quoted The Jerusalem Post as saying.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on household harm right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the external air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that 3.8 million people die early every year due to poor air quality in their homes.
“Because of the coronavirus epidemic that has forced many people to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it’s time to focus on the quality of air in their homes,” Abraham said.
In Israel, the quality of “home air” is almost no one concerned.
However, dangerous things can be things with which a person normally comes into contact - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
