What do you think? ČSSD does not know Voldemort or confectionery in Prague
The new councillors of the ČSSD will, apparently, have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representativeship.
The Journal of Aktualne.cz members of the new council from ČSSD - tried - as they know the notoriously established slang, which was established in the town hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political creamer during the previous era of Mayor Paul Bem, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors do not understand very much.
At least that's what he says.
Who is Voldemort
I really don't know -
“I’m more of a novice in Prague policy,” he responded to the test of the “Komotrovsky” dictionary for the culture of Lukáš Kaučky.
Although it was a political veteran, the councilman Karel Březina reacted similarly.
For example, the term \"golf hole\"
“It’s the only expression you give me, which I sometimes use.”
I don’t generally recognize slang.
From the dictionary, which was published in June before the ODS electoral Congress this year by Aktunalne.cz, the editors selected six examples, mainly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
Socialists were supposed to explain the terms “Voldemort”, “the largest golf hole in Prague”, to go to the confectionery”, “the bull’s neck”, “the betrayal of the capital”, and to “restrain”
Three councillors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague's school in the future - first promised the interview, but later did not take the phone.
The fifth councilman Petr Dolínek rejected the test.
“I don’t solve these things at all, and I won’t judge how civil Democrats are enjoying it.”
“Now I’m trying to figure out how we’re going to understand each other in our programs,” he said.
As it has already been said, the councilman Lukáš Kaucky would not have reported in the title above that he was talking about an influential entrepreneur and friend of the exprimator, Roman Janošek.
“Voldemort,” Kaucky said, “the only term he correctly estimated in the test is the largest golf hole in Prague.”
“That’s Blanka tunnel,” Kaucky says, adding immediately, “but I know it more from the newspaper.”
“I’ll have to pay for a language course,” he jokes.
The Golf Hole then, like the Blanka tunnel, decrypts the administration not only Matador Karel Březina, but also the environmental councillor Lukáš Plachy.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Luke Plachem is also aware of where to find this character - he knows the meaning of the expression - to go to the confectionery - .
“I mean to go to a Prague business,” he said, “it’s too close to the dissolution that it’s the headquarters of Janouskovy companies.
In contrast to Březina, he reminds us that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, there is no similar slang vocabulary.
“I’ve been happy with my colleagues too, but it looks like we don’t really have anything like that.
“We call ourselves names, sometimes the abbreviations and complexes of names are used,” says Petr Hulínský, Chairman of the Prague ČSSD, whose siders are called Hulda.
“At school, they called me Bříza, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” said Karel Březin.
The current.cz name has been tested and works.
Radní Weinert is a grandfather or less friendly grandfather, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned of fraud in the party's sponsorship before the election, has a nickname for some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only things social Democrats admit in their internal language.
Hulínsky said Huldu did not like to hear it, but Aktuně.cz also recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
“Doctor of obscene law,” he said, reminds that Petr Hulínský won his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of “marries” by issuing a brochure
Women declared to be witch in Burkina Faso have several common signs.
They are more of an older generation, they cannot engage in work, for example, for health reasons, they are free and do not have children.
The witch is sent into isolation, not threatening the rest of the village.
“Men can only do this very rarely.”
“Neither do young healthy women, because they help work and give birth to children,” describes the orderly sister who takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against an unusual “social” measure.
She has published an information booklet that should help to limit the witch hunt.
The thing has a hook.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are unable to read,” Die Standard reported.
Blame of witchcraft is common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, which is neighboring Burkina Faso, a twenty-seven-year-old Amma Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, and they poured kerosene and burned her.
The BBC reported the case.
The perpetrators said it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual anointing came into contact with a woman.
It was said that after the group wanted to drive the evil spirit out of the woman.
The isolation of the sorceresses is supported by people regardless of the level of education they have achieved.
Der Standard quoted a twenty-four-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “Human soul eaters have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the witch hunt seeks to moderate the government, the president himself took part in Gambia last year.
After the death of his aunt, Gambi’s president, Jammí, started a huge witch hunt that was supposed to be involved in her death and tried to kill the president himself with the help of black magic.
“To help him, he invited shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers, and the President’s personal security, forcibly led randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the President’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, people incarcerated had to drink the herb from the herb with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two arrests on the farm survived.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
Bakal's tenant: Tops in the stoves, higher lease signed
The older man has stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Byty-Uhlobarona - Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of rent apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arms he carried a file and a new lease contract to three dwellings: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three of them raised the rent.
Instead of 3,500 per month, the son will pay 2+1 for the second category of 4,100 crowns from next year.
“And it’s not warm water there, and petram must melt (a solid fuel stone, a.k.a.),” shows the man with his finger in a new covenant with his son, for whose signature he has full power.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry and half-resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which marked the new lease terms as “uncorrect and immoral,” advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7 when it publishes instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man only has his hand over it.
“One says it, the other says, ‘He’s frowning.
Ostrava becomes a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, there are a large majority of apartments that still have a non-market lease in the Czech Republic.
Therefore, currently.cz decided to visit the “laboratorium” personally.
The Havířov waiting room RPG is one of the four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday morning.
Right next to the door, there is a security guard from the security agency and a caller.
2011 - a special button on its touchscreen is lit.
One tap and a number paper comes out of the machine.
You will not be able to read -157 - and your digit is already hammering on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're on your way in half a second.
The rent comes after a while to ask an older married couple, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to affect new rents at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems like any other - requests for repairs, insurance events and so on.
Letters with new lease agreements are sent to the mailboxes in Ostrava by tenants of most of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio from about mid-November.
The RPG Apartments offer them a 15 to 38 percent increase in rent in letters.
A special desk for new rents was opened at the client center on 18 November.
It’s running for over a week, so it’s just in the process,” the workers behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local energizing theme.
Before the election, he was taken by the vice-president of the parliament and the Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.
“Neither did the desk in the toilet change me,” the man said at the beginning.
According to employees, pensioners come to see if they will get a discount on the rent if they sign in time as the RPG promises them on a special offer.
Half the discount on February rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
Havířovská - deregulation - the counter, but the questions are certainly not entangled.
“Of yesterday’s 360 clients, there were only about forty to fifty people due to the 2011 lease,” they estimate the staff behind the counter.
At the same time, the RPG on the site and its boards proposes individual contracts to be negotiated where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
“It’s not about threats, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate legal practices,” the RPG said on its website.
“No one here will judge,” one of the employees of the RPG Apartment and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her partly the truth.
“I have 13,000 pensions and I have five thousand left for food, I don’t have to judge,” he says.
But the staff will soon find out.
We'll see -
“Mr. Zaoralek is telling them not to sign, so they probably wait,” he says.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011, and according to the RPG Apartment, their increase is an economic necessity.
“The existing rent still does not reach even the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,” recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Apartments, that just by an angry tenant, the negligence of the housing fund, according to homeowners, is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, the RPG from leases could invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats several red highlighted information.
A 15 percent increase in rent in 2011 and less applies to 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of the apartments of RPG -
-And it will always be the most about $7.50 per square meter and a month, - it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will be raised by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter,” the RPG said.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
The RPG Apartments promises that deregulation will not eliminate rents jumply, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see chart) will put the company back into apartments, mainly in thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
They are preferred to be given by people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The office also includes a kindergarten, architects understood
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, she has been visited by the children of Arch.Design employees.
The design-architectonic company Arch.Design, from whose studios came a number of significant Brno buildings, counted on the space for its corporate minischool from the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of babyboom, and she made sure that designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of shorter periods, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under a social program.
Thus, stavorists and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with the care of the child.
The minischool was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of the leadership, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant financing (a grant of CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years) Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year, and with applications for subsidies, Economy Rating significantly helped.
Care is provided by qualified staff, children are taken care of daily by the nurse and teacher of the school, so children with no age limit can go to kindergarten, yet most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a “minischool”, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will be replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents, and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although these are individual education and care, the programme filling in the mini-school is comparable to the preschool education framework programme.
Children not only play here, but are also provided with quality teaching - from basic learning to preparation for school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulant games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and get away with stressful situations with late pick-up of children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal relationship between employees and employers.
Arch.Design has thus ranked among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly with the family, and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house from the bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of the ancient lake, the staircase resembles the spine of the dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, thanks to its organic shapes, the house has earned the nickname House from the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facades resembling scales and omnipresent soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí’s Art Nouveau.
The front of the house is played by dream lines, tender colors and textures resembling nature and animals.
In detailed observation, geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order are seen.
At night the whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the shine of colors is even strengthened.
The winding and twisting of shapes appear equally in the interiors.
The wood in the waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of the door, cuckoo and rails.
The house of Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was built by the reconstruction of the house from 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on destroying the old building and building a completely new one, but soon adopted Gaudí’s idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The house of Casa Batlló, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaic on the facade.
Many other artists and artists worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started the successful cooperation of Jujola with Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Gaudí house Casa Milá and the Güell Park, where there are other Gaudí works.
From the locals, the house soon after it was completed earned thanks to its organic shapes the nickname ‘Bone House’.
Others called it a “living house” because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia, is likened at the top of the building.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí in the house designed for his time a unique system of central heating with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five degree inclination.
During the creation of Gaudí, he did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the building, however, it was so vague that two years later, the city council was threatened and asked for a correction.
For example, the council was interested in the fact that the building interfered with the pillars and the public walkway.
There has never been a remedy, on the contrary: only 15 days after the challenge of the city part, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social living room and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The entire six-storey house crosses the staircase, which can be climb up to the roof terrace itself.
The fundamental elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be connected completely by opening the living room doors, and the larger company can communicate comfortably together without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí also acquired an unconventional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles is impressive, which is covered with inner courtyards and skylights.
The game of two colors gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most lavish apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The tours continued because they found it to be a very advantageous enterprise and in addition, they expanded the tours with common and attic spaces, including the roof terraces.
The entrance to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and the students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the entry price for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of a house with dragon towers, you need to quickly go with one of the inhabitants of the dachshund and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grates: women have different requirements than men
Not a decent frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying area, i.e. mattresses and grate, give the foundation a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, it decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
The type of interior to which mattresses and grates are made is also important.
A typical example?
For example, at weekend cottages where they don’t sink regularly, latex mattresses aren’t suitable, because they’re warming up more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to regularly reverse it.
For if they do not have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they still lie on the hard plate, they retain moisture: a mold might appear beneath them.
The custom is also decided when choosing.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where many high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
Perhaps all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they wouldn’t sleep here.
For their muted shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam -
“These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they don’t take the “information” from joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were looking for rope-foam mattresses years ago.
“Today it’s fine, suitable mattresses need Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico”
You don't have to be a NHL borec to appreciate a lazy foam.
This “miracle” works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't turn around at night like you're after a tough game.
You'll just sleep better.
The foam lines also function as a protection against lay-offs.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height, add even the length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm so they need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
-Jinak is a rule for the width of the bed simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly curved in the elbow, - advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, a feature of the Feature of Upholstery and Decorators, which has been dedicated to the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures it at professional schools.
For a double bed, each needs its own grate and mattress, but here, be careful when buying, to align the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grates to different heights, but you may not be able to do so with each frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on a forming and crippling layer.
“When you touch your hand or sit on the mattress, you must definitely not feel the springs,” says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full-blown beds, when mattresses and substrates are like grown Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses do not ventilate properly, their cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since in the night we normally sweat 0.2 to .75 l sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and clogged) net.
Therefore, experts refuse advertising slogans about the lifespan of mattresses for up to 25 years or even lifetime guarantees.
Everything has its own but.
Therefore, advice from sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up removable coating, but add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are commonly produced today, we will get two parts (very important for washing and washing machines!), however, handling in larger types (and with one person) when we shoot could resemble the fight of light weight in the heavy ring.
Do you have a hard board in bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum bed for one night visits.
However, keep the plate (if it no longer has) ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a supple layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-positional slats with 14 to 18 slats, but you will always be paid gratings with a larger number of slats, 28 or more, where the hip slats are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning slats do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to setting the rigidity of the slats, you can also afford the so-called shoulder cradle.
This is a special fixture of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slats so that the shoulder sleeps well - it breaks down -
For men who have “arms over the whole back” - definitely an important thing.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses who started using the softening zone in the shoulder area remember it.
Women also remember - they again give the softer surface in the places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate gratings with so-called multi-tort foaming.
Pressure spreads to more points and reduces tension.
Be careful, however, when you apply a bad pillow to the right mattress and grate (a big and “boiled”, most of the “plus” will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips interfere only with the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which they prefer in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (along with the shoulder collar of the grate or softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original straws filled with grass.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is also for bio mattresses.
The raw materials from which polyurethane foam is produced are replaced by natural oils, for example from jumping and soy.
Soybeans are probably used by all known producers.
“Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of material of pure natural origin,” explains Petr Vašček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules to release fresh scents of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man-cools-the plant extract from the birch to absorb heat and cool the body, women, on the other hand, cover-tops
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it weaker sex warmer.

The mattress made of cold foam (has larger pores with a broken cell structure, is so breathable than regular polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining the different stiffnesses of cold foams and 'linens', foams form multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel should be.
For quality mattresses, you will pay from seven thousand crowns and higher.
Those that meet health standards have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as medical devices.
It was the first to achieve this advantage of Gumotex in the Czech Republic.
Saving on mattresses and grates is not easy.
Sometimes it is possible to use the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a memory foam in the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second can be purchased for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and high density has launched Tempur material at a pace.
It was originally created as a material for NASA as astronauts were exposed to enormous overloads at launches.
The temperature in the heat is soft, but in the cold it is fixed.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and decomposes its pressure optimally.
Therefore, it is ideal against the appearance of beds, but also for increasing the comfort of sleeping.
Viskoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special foot pillows, which relieve the legs and venous system.
For example, domestic manufacturers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam, and so on.
People's surveillance devices want more and more parents, they want to carbonize their children.
Fear of a child brings more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system originally created for searching for cars can also track the movement of people, helping, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatková.
So far, the device is as big as a siren box, but soon it can only be large as a watch.
Many people were scared of the missing Anička case and began to drink in ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood of becoming a tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking equipment on the Czech market.
“I admit that in a certain case, such devices may be misused, for example, when they go into a bag to someone who doesn’t know about it, but we haven’t met with such a case yet,” he said.
“Most of the time, customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the “crab” is used and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Children’s psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn’t want to wear anything like that, he simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Great expectations have been raised earlier by parents of mobile phones, but they can be turned off just like these tracking devices,” Bočková said.
It is also disputed whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
“As far as the kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child does not have any electronics that could reveal his position.”
It's a phone -
“When tracking devices expand, they will look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising.”
“In such a case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the event of an accidental attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack, its presence can help.
The device can be set to a regular sending position after a certain period of time.
If damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available.
“The more expensive devices have built-in and inclination meters, so even if a person just slips and remains still to lie still, the device will send a warning immediately with the positioning,” the Czech Republic says.
According to him, a similar service can also take away smartphones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to the pendants of the size of the siren box or smaller mobile phones.
It always threatens to lose them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, the device looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that any aggressor may not know the tracking device at all -
“He knows them only after a while, and that can give the police extra time,” he adds.
Whether they develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology as used for car surveillance.
It is a combination of location detection via GPS (which use common autonavigation) and the mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has inflammable cords that it would be used by the Czech Republic, but it will only last for two years.
The Czech Army bought 445 km of cords to launch the cracks.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 km of cords to warehouses.
The military has a stockpile for 225 years.
The problem is that the length of the cords is two, a maximum of four years.
The Army bought incandescent cords from the STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of MF TODAY’s inflammatory cords, said soldiers consume 60 kilometers of inflammation per year in training.
However, it follows from the calculations of military pyrotechnicians that MF DES has addressed, that all generals, military commanders, secretary and cleaning officers would have to undergo a very intense pyrotechnic training every year.
Defence minister Alexander Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pic is not exempt.
Only then could the annual consumption of the army be justified 60 kilometers of lighters.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, military supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each new professional, it is sufficient to have a maximum of two meters of inflammatory cord, as experts say, the army has secured with a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of ginseng or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
The soldiers of the quick-track crew recently complained to Minister Vondre that they had almost no bullets in their handguns, so the shootings were limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
“It doesn’t take my head to buy so many lighters from us”
“But it’s their decision, and they certainly know what they’re going to be doing.”
“For us, the army is a good customer to whom we as traders try to meet,” says Jan Děčky, Business Manager of STV Group.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan Peszek justifies hundreds of kilometers of the cords he has purchased, and that the army will have the supplies of this “munition” for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcky of the STV Group speaks only of the four-year lifespan of the lighter and the police or military pyrotechnics even about two years.
“With perfect storage, these may be the four,” says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to make a name public due to criticism of the army.
After the end of life, every ammunition must be carefully tested whether it is yet reliable and does not threaten soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is the quantitative discount to 445 kilometers of inflammable cords.
“We were costing 60 percent less than last year’s supply of two hundred and forty-four kilometers,” Pejšek said in a statement.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of the firing lines of police pyrotechnicians who have liquidated ammunition from the Second World War or here after the Soviet army does not exceed a few years of 1500 meters.
And the police always order only such a quantity to consume this ammunition before the expiry of its life.
It has been proven for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and can also be more flexible to obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence has already had considerable difficulties with the destruction of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to draw on the Rhine.
The Czech problem awaits in a few years, according to the Pyrotechnicians, which MF DES has addressed: it will eliminate the hundreds of kilometers of old lighters it buys today.
I am still drawing on the contacts I received from the competition.
The winning place in the Trader of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year’s competition was the eight-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a semi-distorted house with five apartments.
To the fact that he was still a third-year college student at that time, that was a great courage.
“The ratio between the quality and the price of the accommodation did not give me anything to try to do,” says Lukas Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
All profit invested back into the house, which gradually turned into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually opened four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year, there was another one that was just as good as this one.
“We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise is reported,” says the number one tradesperson last year.
“And on this sale, the license to operate the hotel was a big part of the victory in the Trader of the Year competition,” Pytloun said.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me in addition, and I have to say that it was pleasant,” he reminds me.
Taking part in the competition definitely recommends everyone who is trying to do something.
There is no need to win, every visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have reached otherwise.
I started trading on a regular basis with some of the competitions I met.
He said that the fame of success has been somewhat affected by every employee.
And that he's about 70.
“I see greater loyalty and pride in participating in something that has gained general recognition,” he said.
“It’s not far from my personal success, it’s the result of the good work of all of us together.”
“Only my name is placed in the foreground,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in the Farmet.
Euphoria quickly replaced the consequences of the crisis.
However, thanks to the winner's purpose, the Farmet has worse times in a row.
For the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Competition, the Company last year the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, arrived in the Slavanský House.
At that time, the jury appreciated the effort, through which he built from a small tooling workshop in the Czech Skalica company with hundreds of millions of turnovers.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my co-workers and increased our self-confidence for the match against the competition,” said the winner last year.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history, the desire to do something useful was a desire.
And so, when the state offered father Karl Žďárski to rent a small workshop as compensation for communists seized property, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father, they founded the company on plastic baths.
Soon after, they began to specialize in plant oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest producer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the inexpertious public, the company got more awareness after success in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to see the Farmet brand much better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
However, last year was not only a sign of euphoria from the winners in the Farmet.
The award was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
It has culminated in a crisis that has not yet touched so many citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and started to limit purchases of new machines and technologies.
Of course, this situation has not been avoided for us either.
“The sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and we also went to release,” explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company has to be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
However, they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, although less than before the crisis.
However, from what they did not discount in Farmet, there is an investment in research and development.
“We built a research and training centre from the subsidies, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won the main awards in domestic exhibitions,” says Žďárský.
It all shows that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
“I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel Žďárský.
A summary that eliminates absurd regulations
Absurdit of the year is a fourth part of the business tradition.
Some absurd regulations have already been lifted.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdita survey became the obligation to carry documents that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the four thousand votes voted on.
For example, the social security administration required a paper extract from the commercial register, although the official may obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, it will change.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during checks on insurance payers,” said Jan Buraňová, a spokesperson for the Czech Ministry for Social Security.
Enlightenment on all regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and the absurd cancellation is the purpose of the Absurdita competition of the year.
This is already the fourth part of the business tradition organized by the Economic Newspapers this year, and there is an increasing popularity among the public.
If there were about 3,000 votes last year, this year there were almost 4,000 votes.
And there is no wonder, there are various legal obligations that are only used to keep the business going, there are still enough and enough of us.
“We are in the leading places in the world,” notes Karel Havelček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, in terms of business conditions, the Czech Republic ranked 74th, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
An administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be claimed annually from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The website www.confirmaroku.cz will then select seven candidates for the “anticene” and will have the public vote on the website www.confirmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote on it during October.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations that make sense.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also professional unions and journalists.
Among the “finalists”, the competition was for example a requirement for cars to pay tolls for the maintenance of highways and high-speed roads, or for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the competition’s website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the Wenceslas Square in Prague in early November, is part of the hapenning, which regularly takes part in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, assisted the competition.
“Economic prosperity can’t work where the state throws business keys under its feet, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today are just super-complicated by business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
An attempt to break an absurd order does not sound empty.
In 2007, people were most affected by the obligation of an entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention of going with a stand for an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was eliminated by the amendment of the trade law.
The second-most-voting obligation in 2007 to report to the Labour Office for its foreign employee on a business trip of up to 30 days was removed by the Green Card Act.
And to the third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 became the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two physiotherapists in the office.
This year, it was reduced by the decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator fell.
The new category is appreciated by socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
This year’s fifth edition of the competition for Economic Newspapers is called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The aim of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the advertiser and promoter of the competition as well as in the event of a rebel of the year.
Until this year’s first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafone Company of the year 2010, companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish a separate article.
Although the subject matter of its activities differs from one another in a diametrical manner, support and consideration can be considered as the common denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, people with disabilities and, elsewhere, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 national finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the fund sponsoring disabled children for 17 years.
In turn, her disabled employees are taken care of by a paper company from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of them, which is why she won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and the Vodafone Company of the Year competition was placed in the region as a third.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, who introduced flexible working hours, won even reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded the title for buying primarily from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the nearby area and saving the environment.
“We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible,” explains Miluša Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecké Region, in turn, thinks about the health of its employees and for each laptop it has bought ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local protected workshop at its corporate events.
“In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which helps the local Roma community in particular,” says Ondrej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní and cleaning from Karlovarský Region, which contributes to their employees through above-standard bonuses.
“In turn, we are making contributions to food, transport, qualifications and recreation,” says Josef Strapač of the Bruntál building company Times, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All Vodafone Regional Finalists of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application, were automatically logged in to the category Responsible Company of the year and submitted by the organizers by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then deleted from the evaluation by the organiser.
-If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, the responsible company of the year could not participate, but they are not disqualified from the \"main\" competition Vodafone Company of the year -
“It is not possible to register for this competition alone because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Company of the Year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police arrested in public competition at the Land Fund in Pilsen
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
Iron detectives have deployed local entrepreneurs in the media sphere and a real estate trader Luboš G.
He reportedly tried to manipulate the currently running public competition to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would obtain specific candidates.
He was supposed to pay half a million dollars for it.
“In the meantime, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the crime of the public contract and in the public competition,” said Antonie Zelená, Chief of State Prosecutor’s Office in Pilsen, saying that further details cannot be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
Sixteen-year-old police officer was released after 24 hours.
The way in which the public competition could influence can only be speculated given the minimum of official information.
A spokesperson for the Land Fund, Lubomír Černá, said that police had actually been arrested in a separate workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
“It was a client, not our employee,” she said.
According to the Black, the public competition has the correct name “Call for the offer of land transfer rights” and is held in the event that more legitimate applicants are interested in the land offered.
- These persons offer higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land -
“According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims,” the fund’s spokesman explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who had joined the call, and since he himself was also a legitimate person, since he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to interested in the plot that he would not participate in the competition.
He probably paid off the severances.
That would explain that he had such a large amount of money in detention.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts with PF in Pilsen already in the past.
He was found in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing in a replacement restitution land on which a decision was already issued on the location of the building.
It was at that time that Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the arrival hall was to be built into the industrial zone of the Borská field.
Later, he changed them very favorably with the magistrate for the house in the very historical center of the city, which had a value much higher.
At that time, the town hall had to approach it, because otherwise it would threaten the building by blocking the land.
Residential homes pay hundreds of dollars a month
As of January, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and stems, heat supplies and rents will grow somewhere.
As of January, families will have to pull up hundreds of crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for the supply of water, and many will also feed the supply of central heat.
The cost of electricity in the apartments should cost households a hundred crowns a year than it is now.
Power electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in support for renewable energy production, especially photovoltaics.
Gas will cost slightly, but at a time when people melt the most and have the highest consumption.
It also has to count on hundreds of extra crowns each year.
While electricity and gas are expensive throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
Increases in prices are mainly planned for larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kralove will pay about 50 CZK a month for central heating, paying more than 1000 crowns a year in Liberec.
In turn, Prague residents are at risk of more than 9% more expensive water and steel, if the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the desired 6.8 percent will be paid.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the overall comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it has a watery and turbulent subjugation of 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices can increase significantly in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation ends from January.
For example, the company CPI Apartments, which owns about 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new rent will bring the company to court.
Regulated rents, which are paid by people in approximately 300,000 apartments, could increase by up to 10% next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is made of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, and a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking ends most often in the care of doctors drunk, who have not yet been 15 years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly in the hospital from the monkey.
This is due to the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the receptions of the children's department of hospitals.
Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to drink them.
“The trend is certainly hard alcohol,” said Ludek Pelikán, the primary child department of the Hospital Hořovice in Central Bohemia.
“If they manage to pull a bottle out of the closet, it’s about whiskey, otherwise fernet and vodka predominates.”
“The hydrogen has the advantage of pouring it into juice and not feeling so much of it,” the prime minister explained.
And he is also right by the spokesman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
The most common is fernet or rum.
“This is modern alcohol today especially in primary schools.”
“In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought home,” Jurin said.
According to Pelican, 13 or 14-year-olds in hospital income are quite common.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been operating since this year, he worked for ten years on pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances catch up with overcrowded schoolchildren from a wide area.
“One girl lay with us about four times.”
“She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought to us with 3.5 Promile of blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy,” the doctor said in a statement.
She was at an exhibition site in Holešovice for some dance party.
“It’s interesting that her mother didn’t find it strange that she didn’t know about her daughter 48 hours,” the prime minister said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own descendants that is considered the main cause of growing childhood drinking.
However, dependence in the true sense cannot be discussed in children, according to experts.
The term “alcoholic” means a several-year-old chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not the case in children.
“In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is rather a notable family-social background,” Pelikán explained.
According to a spokesperson for Jurin, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at a hospital in Motol this year.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital get into the statistics.
Children's drunks, who are taken by their parents after an outpatient treatment, or brought home by police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases where children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of the bark, there are three seasonal fluctuations, according to Pelikan, on which one can rely: the witch, the New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
They either drink the lamentation of the wrong testimony or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday.
“I’ve experienced seven children’s drunks at the same time on the witch,” Pelikán said.
Drunk, who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors, is paradoxically in comparison to the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will cause an irrigation infusion with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
“They’re actually better off because they have a nice evening experience and a good awakening experience, and nothing hurts.
“Only they are confused about where they are,” Pelikán admitted, adding that it sometimes spoils patients with a pleasant mood at least by calculating the costs that their treatment required.
The transport of ambulances and hospitalization on an acute bed will go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“I used it as a means of education, when I directly calculated on the vision, how much their drunkness cost, and that they could also spend the whole summer at the Brigade to make money for that one party,” Pelikán said.
However, health insurance companies, according to him, do not approach regression proceedings in which parents would recover the cost of treatment in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two L-159 aircraft from a total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M, flew to Sevilly, Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS aircraft was based.
This is the first time machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech Army.
So far, they have only been in practice or demonstration years.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1 which was operated by the Czech Army and which were aerable.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
You are still standing in Aera Vodochody and the trade broker - Omnipol - took over last week.
When the aircraft is physically shipped out of the Vodochod, it is not yet known according to Jan Pešek from the Press Department of Defense.
“The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the exchange were set aside from long-term aircraft, without any additional deposits and investments from the Ministry’s ministry.
“The two-seat L-159T1s have been changed in their current state and form,” Pejšek said.
He added that the army would not remain without two-seat aircraft because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth 200 million crowns to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July and the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pešek, EADS has committed to deploying aircraft into the armaments of some alliance countries.
“The agreement makes it clear that the L-159 aircraft recipient is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.”
“It is therefore a matter for the customer to realize this matter,” Peszek said.
Economic newspapers said the Spanish army had no interest in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one of Casa’s aircraft and the purchase of three additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirka Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not write a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
At the time, the defense leadership argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aero and only uses 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably also have a court settlement.
In fact, the European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because it had to choose aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Kbely Airport in 14 days.
Longer pointer than ring indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than the ring are at less risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of a study published by the British Cancer Magazine on Wednesday.
It may be related to testosterone hormone levels.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under the age of 60,” study co-author Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick, said in a statement.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men were followed by colleagues in the UK.
More than half of the participants had a pointer on their right hand shorter than the ring.
They were given the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had a marker longer than the ring, however, this risk fell by 33 percent, for men to sixty, the decrease was even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - appears to reflect the different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that testosterone just promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, said that he knows about this study in a consistent manner, but he does not seem to know that the relationship between finger length and cancer is “fully proven”
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and roads, usually there is snow, roads in many places drive all night long.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was said by the Central Motorsport (UAMK) dispatcher.
On the 91st kilometre, a truck crashed, two trucks collided for the 93rd kilometre, and the accident requested injury.
A number of cars also ended up in the pit.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should go to Brno for the 190 km or cross Brno and then reach 182 km on Kývalce.
There are several miles of columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a several-centimetre layer of snow, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car colonies are formed on Prosek, for example, and the Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the track between Charles Square and the Peace Square.
At eight o’clock in the morning, Prague’s crisis crew will meet again.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways had to cancel seven rapid connections due to snow.
For example, the route has problems from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already roadside, but only with increased caution.
There are three side roads in Vyškovsk, there are snow languages in Brno and snow chains are needed to overcome certain roads in the snow chains above.
The most affected places were Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucerov and also Šaratice - Milesovice.
It will be necessary to put the cutters into their stretching.
When they are released, they cannot be estimated yet.
There is a need for caution in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained only by inert splinter to protect nature, lies up to a five-centimetre layer of snow, the Czech Republic said.
In the Czech Republic it occurred from two to ten centimeters of snow, the most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
About 15 centimeters of snow occurred in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The snow in the Czech Republic gradually ceases.
U.S. troops have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and “change the game” in their favor.
A new weapon is like a small super-precise gun.
Its projectiles guide a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special charges of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, actually function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only in an impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a moor.
For it is usually not protected from the top, and when the deadly rain of steel shards endures, it can put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first gun for a infantry that uses \"smart\" technology.
In principle, the soldier treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, so he will get a specified intentional point, adjusts the target and pushes the tap -
\"Let's say you've measured 543 meters.\"
“When you press the trigger, the gun will charge and fire the shot at a distance of 543 meters plus a minus one, two or three meters,” Audette said.
There will be 400 jobs.
Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant who specializes in computers and their maintenance said Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from a previous administrative building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the Fuist spokesperson, there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which are currently divided in the region, in the near future.
The rental offer was said to have been very attractive, and large-scale offices in Astro Park are said to be more suitable for the working way of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only in rent.
A competent executive, Bernd Wagner, said, “In Frankfurt-Niederrad, we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure.”
Excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important enterprise within the region has brought joy to the winners and disappointments of the defeated.
Markus Frank (CDU), the head of economic referent in Frankfurt, said he was able to win a “global player”
It is said to be a fantastic expression of trust in this place.
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed in time by the management of the company about its intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in the Marienbader-náměstí.
As a result, there were crucial economic reasons.
Now it’s about avoiding long dissatisfaction in such a prominent place.
I hope that the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative.
The house on the Rathaus Square, which has been used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring-Kleine Vertikale, were among the most discussed building plans of the spa town ten years ago.
Between the railway station and the town hall, it was created as a common project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticized both because of the massive construction of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and at the same time because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri’s investment advice and rating company, a manufacturer of travel distribution software, started Amadeus, moved into the house, as well as Fujitsu computer manufacturer, who was still associated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and after a year were sold by Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computer companies and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but most Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, another subsidiary in the site will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administration building of Astro Park, 7,000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the stellar floor plan, which is 20 years old, it also houses the central union of the electrical and electronics industries.
Amazon turns off server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks gets into the narrow.
Amazon has turned off a detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic deputies.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol search list, is expected to stay behind from one newspaper post in the UK.
“Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon”
“Free speech in the country of the free” was announced by the activists of the publication service of short Twitter messages on Wednesday.
Shortly before, Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic messages in order to handle a large number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained this step: “We will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, then they should stop selling books.
Amazon stopped using its Wikileaks servers after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers carried out a search, CNN reported on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
President of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, said British Guardian
“I would like Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman called for the prevention of the platform in the use of servers in other countries as well.
“Wikileaks acts illegally, indiscriminately, and ruthlessly, and thus our national security is exposed to danger and threatens life on the whole planet,” the senator said in a statement.
No responsible company, either American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to expand their stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is sought after by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in London's newspaper, The Independent, a 39-year-old Australian resides in the UK, Scotland Yard reportedly knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
“Even the challenges were to murder Julian Assange.”
That's why Assange is just worried about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson is likely to have responded to North America’s statements.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked the responsible person to be charged and executed for posting on Wikileaks because of betrayal.
In Canada, one of Stephen Harper’s chief executive advisers, apparently ironically, told television, “Assange should be killed,” and Obama could use a “target aircraft.”
In the meantime, she moved between the White House and Assange's vocabulary.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “a ridiculous and absurd one” that Assange requested the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for the recently published espionage calls to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we’re interested in one person’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and interests in this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government now has extensive research into the security of its databases.
The Special Agent was appointed Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorist Measures, Russell Travers, told the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of “necessary reforms in the structure”, which are necessary after the publication of the news from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to explore how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger due to the publication on Wikileaks.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
We are prepared to protect them, if necessary.
Ice Cream University
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for better seasons.
The basic course for future ice creamers, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a Czech slightly obsolete ice creamer, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling box, rubs it into the braid and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about ice cream is not to be avoided by Gelato-University, the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, an ice cream machine manufacturer set up an ice cream university to ensure that ice cream from its machines correspond to high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, is a huge interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses about chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Someone longs for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others dare on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own job after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman at home Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explain to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano won’t forget the cake during her training on Southern and Patriotic cherry: ‘Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there’s still a notable dose of romance.
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano inserts the essential ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which will heat everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then cool immediately to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with a tap and runs out pasteurized white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the doctor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you experiment yourself?
Luciano warns to be carried by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Those talking about ice cream - only from natural ingredients - apparently used stabilizers as well - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold in one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer itself ice grain.
Certain variations of basic matter are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you.
But you should just experiment.
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white base matter, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of any chocolate temptation.
Now the participants of the course can go to ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them always produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base matter, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Ice cream does not have to taste more nutmeg when it contains more hazelnut.
The most popular ice cream from kiwi will be produced by a group that will use more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture picks up the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerous task: If a peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra serving of sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano extracts a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winers measure the must from grapes).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the numbers.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the machine for automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a device that is ready-made ice cream mixture at the same time placed in the cream and cools to minus the temperature.
Despite all automation, we will not avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will dirty himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when he gets out of control of a huge blender.
“In every course,” said Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time when something like this happens.”
Reviewers in double light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This allegation has now been expressed by a group of experts from Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute to estimate the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well,” said Christoph Then, the head of the Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
Efsa’s leading expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and Efsa’s other expert have had a contract with the association of lobbyists Ilsi for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in Efsa’s genetic plant control regulations and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
Efs’ regulations are said to be in line with the Ilsi documents in the whole paragraphs, carrying a manuscript of the industry that should be controlled by the Italian Parliament’s office.
This is the second time Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efs without additions or transitional time to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - has changed the parties.
Also, radio for Central Germany (MDR) has recently revealed the staff link between the EU’s control authority and the industrial lobby, which has attracted interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Efs are not required not to have contacts with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics, among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently permitted in animals without any feeding attempt, and that no genetic plant response to environmental impacts is tested.
“We want to know, for example, what will a genetically modified corn do in the field,” said Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
“If they don’t look for risks, how could they be found then,” Then asks.
Angelika Hilbeck also agrees.
The researcher has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical College in Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe as well as in the United States.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who would not be associated with the company.
Studies that are critical to companies are usually not published.
“Industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the Stuttgart station, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands of demonstrations against S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings lay in ruins.
It's broken into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Crailsheim limestone, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
These stones are relics.
He must not disappear.
“The left and the poor stone, the simple and the original”
When he cut one, he smelled like a cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former depot of the French army ammunition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades with old stones.
He bought all the ones that were created during the Stuttgart crash.
“It would have been a shame if they had broken into a gravel or disappeared on a deposit,” he said in his office, a wooden box that was previously a watchhouse.
He says he was bewildered and threatened when it was in all the newspapers in September that he bought the remains of the northern wing from a society that was carrying out a demortization.
He spoke to the S-21 opponents all day long.
And he told them that he couldn’t do it for the democracies.
And when this happens, then it is the most reasonable when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents every one of about 80 kilograms a heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope to return it during the reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled out what went into the trunk and on the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long been transformed into “leafs” or as the edges of flower beds with herbs.
“This stone is really nothing special,” Rongen says.
If it wasn’t for the political sutures.
He sits in his off-road car and rides a ride through his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied first rights, interrupted studies, later biology, then interested in computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones.
He's taking away his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the largest merchant with old stones in the republic.
It's braking.
There is an artistic sandstone in the snow.
“One belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden,” he says.
The sandstone from Labe, yellow, warm, is excited.
My favorite stone -
Go on the way up through the forest.
It points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
There you go.
- Nice travertine -
One day, they belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, a tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were manually broken and transported using simple hoist machines and bull carriages, he becomes completely respectful.
“It would be a scandal if something like that were crushed.”
He didn’t become rich, he wasn’t rich at all.
Today, however, a stone dealer employs 14 people, and in addition, stones, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the one who evaluates the remains.
In the near future, he must go to Cologne.
The stones will also be saved there.
The Battle of Talents for High Potentials
There are a lot of people at the snack.
16 students are pressed with loaves with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturers of Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible recruit the most talented graduates in the listening rooms before they get to the labour market and others will be interested in them.
Since universities do not list the successes of their students, companies try to discover exceptional talents in practical-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive company is trying to gain talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department gives away pens, rubber bears and plates with the VW logo.
He tells hopeful young talents about programs for practice, student jobs and suggests their journeys to the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: ‘Students will come into contact with industry and gain experience’
“VW can also meet students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would fit as a collaborator.”
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is that it is so openly fighting for students.
“Jinak was more of a major professional project,” said Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees from long crowds of applicants.
On the contrary, it must try and attract particularly highly qualified labour forces.
First of all, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the so-called lack of engineers will continue to grow.
KPMG’s audit and advisory firm is Roman Dikta for talent hunting.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants have to find a route according to GPS coordination.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can check out KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
Before that, he will decide on two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested people will fly to the United States.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities, the Dicts will continue to have tougher laws.
“We want to distinguish ourselves with our Race from others.”
A simple trip to the sailboat was very little for us.
The Dict Talent Hunter seems lucky.
“We have been in contact with all participants of a similar event last year,”
“Some will soon finish their studies and are planning to apply for a job,” he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, mainly small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically in labour markets.
We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions.
“As for example, at Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, the head of the solar technology manufacturer’s personnel department.
The company from Bonn employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows issues with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are posted on the company’s website.
“Today it’s very difficult, it’s easy to take up free space.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as Freiberg University.
-Professors inform that it is possible for us to do a practice or write a diploma thesis -
A solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
“Big companies often can’t offer it,” says the manager of the personal department of Stübe.
When looking for a job, money has not played a major role.
Flexible working hours, child care or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in one study at Great Place to Work.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and follows the framework conditions of employees.
The manager of the personal department of Stübe hopes that its placement will bring points to job-seekers.
“I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about the external assessments of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
This is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer on the market within its own employees.
Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.
If the company takes good care of their people and they identify with the company, then they will make advertising from themselves to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a rope,” says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil wells
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be created in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government has issued an adequate ban - and thus abolished its earlier plans with final effect.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new wells are prohibited.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should be valid for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drill tower - Deepwater Horizon - in April.
Prior to this disaster, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to pressure the opposition and industry to allow new wells in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
This reduces U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is not clearly explained who bears responsibility for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The center of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigation committee, which Obama has entrusted, should present the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar cancelled the drilling ban that he had paid since the explosion.
They then filed various oil companies applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent disaster-like more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
At present, there is a fundamental reform of the control office, which has pointed out many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish the lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that tighter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil being mined in the Gulf.
Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry - the result of the current survey in the field of consulting company BDO - even before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is still complaining about uncertainty in the field: “Nobody knows exactly what is going to change the regulation.”
Investing in new mining projects is moving until appeal - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of oil leaked have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
“Don’t worry,” the environmental activist calms the journalists: “Today you’ll get enough oil mud in front of the lens.”
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who was broaching around her breasts with water surrounding the smudges: the scene acts in a water shine with rainbow colors almost nicely.
The fact that under the surface there are brown oil clots is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough garnel in the pots, telling Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetta River.
In the meantime, the resulting water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil was poured into a huge, lush area from the broken management.
A fisherman from the nearby town of Bodo must fall for at least six hours to enter the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst infested areas in the world.
On the way along the river, mangrove swamps with many side inflows are only noticeable the entire range of trigger.
The engine cooks brown porridge instead of light water, and who dives his hand into the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves are barred from the ground as black bars of the pharmacy, rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain, we are looking for a flock of birds that usually occur in wet areas: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it will take a breath in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a scary silence.
“What’s going on here is the environmental leadership of war,” says Celestine Akpobari, “we live in constant fear for health.”
Comparing with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where several decades have been fought: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe were recorded here, here in the 1980s the first resistance with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was formed, here Shell had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company cannot return to the Ogoni area: while the entire area of the Delta of three sizes of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining wells and 7,000 kilometres of lead of more than two million barrels of black gold, lies the oil field in the Ogoni ladem area, for the company the situation is very unstable.
Every few hundred meters, steel structures like bizarre sculptures are cast out of the water: “Christmas trees are so delicately called the heads of drilling holes.
They are 50 years old, most of them cut to the turkey.
Every moment such a head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then flows out the constant flow of oil into the water.
According to experts estimates, more than two billion liters in 50 years have flown into the Delta ecosystem: Every year, the amount of oil flowing into the sea at Alaska during the supertanker-Exxon Valdez crash, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes about who is still responsible for the environmental unhappiness.
While Shell calls sabotage and organized oil theft more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists refer to the cracking heads of wells and leaky lines as the main cause.
Shell calls for much less security regulations in Nigeria than it is customary in the world, said US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only a number of leadership failures are said to be “several times higher” than elsewhere.
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oily workshop under the open sky, a figure emerges from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by the leadership, partly arbitrarily scattered around the ground, fire burns: an illegal small refineries.
Oil warms up in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First, it flows out of the lead into the grip pot of gasoline, later it drops at the end of the kerosin line and eventually diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: “We’ll make 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
Delta residents are using chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in Africa.
Nigeria has only one refiner.
Funnyly low price 40 cents euros per liter of oil can still be overcome by illegal manufacturers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from “bunkers” who connect to leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost in the entire Niger Delta region every day.
But only a negligiblely small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the largest share will be filled with organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, in tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate as to whether the people caused the disaster and their interventions or the lax method of production is considered purely academic by Akpobari.
“If oil companies were not considered to be invaders, and if they had not completely destroyed the life of fishermen, there would have been no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, however, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the group’s departure is considered: “Maybe other nations like the Chinese appear to be better.”
Michael's upset.
“It’s time you disappear,” says the manufacturer.
Every moment there may be soldiers.
If they were found by a special military unit, they were not threatened by prison, but by a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
“This damn thing got our land in all respects to the bottom,” Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous building failure in A380 engines
The A380 has a major security issue.
Investigators have detected a possible building failure during a machine inspection that could lead to a “catastrophic engine failure”
Qantas is suing the engine manufacturer.
Qantas airbus passengers were probably more lucky at the start of November than previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety vulnerability on the engines of some A380s, and now warns of a possible building error.
Perhaps the defect would have severe consequences: on one oil connection, cracks could arise due to wear and tear, the ATSB said in a statement published Thursday.
This could lead to a “catastrophic engine failure”
These are engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against British turbine manufacturers.
It brought an action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing for further legal action against that company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and they damaged the carrier area.
Rolls-Royce called it a cause of damage to the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to keep everyone informed.
After the emergency landing of Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snow will cause traffic chaos
Germany was all white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, train connections and planes are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: almost the whole republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures with snow - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there is up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
There is very limited traffic on several highways and many roads.
At the A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still in use, but it did not manage the snow.
There was a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is waiting on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning a stormy tide with a state of water of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snow wills caused significant problems in Saxony on highways and national roads.
According to the center of bad weather, Meteomedia was therefore in Saxony Switzerland the degree of alarm on purple - at all the highest degree.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow occurred there, strong and fresh winds caused the willows.
There were a few trucks and cars there at night.
Police have also reported major road issues in Saxony-Anhalt.
On A2, the wind and snow caused slow traffic and constipation.
There were problems in Durynsk due to snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railway, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Duryn and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken top lines and bends.
Remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In Durine Saalfeld, he had to stop one ICE from Munich.
165 passengers were given wool blankets, food and drink on a train from firefighters and rescuers.
Snow wind over the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at large German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokesperson for flight information, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
Frankfurt nach Mohan has been cancelled for 40 years, according to a spokesman for Fraport.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
There are few passengers left at the airport without a connection, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a collision with a train on a train crossing in East Holstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, there was a similar accident near Nuremberg: there was also a truck captured at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
A 30-year-old woman died after turning her car on a slide road in Aschaffenburg.
Meteorologists, however, have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, which is why it will rise even in light winds.
But the wind is weakening.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be quick winds about the strength of the wind.
But it will be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in Frankfurt’s headquarters.
The property could cost up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters of the group: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers were allowed to re-enter their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group wants the cost of renovating again - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as reported by the Financial Times of Deutschland - with an appeal to a spokesperson.
The speaker did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
“We are constantly investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell the property and then rent it again,” he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany relinquishs its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank took over the twin-towers only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them costlyly.
The energy conversion accounted for around 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts from the industry estimate the value of intermittently renamed towers to “Greenovers” at a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesperson said it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of sorrows for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memory of the inflated miners in New Zealand, who have been declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
Still failed to deliver the dead, because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, a strong explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were thrown down.
A probe was launched in the shaft, where the disaster occurred, but she found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety.
Second, strong detonation was based on authorities and experts from the fact that miners no longer have any chance of survival.
He still failed to deliver the dead.
Now they have honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built on them, helmets, lamps and names of miners.
Also pictures and personal things like clothes and surfboards found their place here.
Flags were half-yielded on government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would leave the “deep ground” again on the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said.
“But they never came home.”
He can't say goodbye to his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was hit down.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
British and South African miners were also hit during the explosion on November 19.
The rescuers began by extinguishing fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases are dissolved, it begins to cool down the high temperatures, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
Hell, warriors!
Is the horror of an art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to beat the old boundaries with his battle epic, “Walhalla Rising”
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think when he filmed “Walhalla Rising”?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his martyrs and in great killing almost with the supernatural power of his opponents - it sounds perfect for young men's viewers looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and his enemies fight even the innermost of the belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One, as it is actually called, during the whole film, does not say a word, and the other characters carry at most one or two sentences or let themselves be cut off to the sad dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and hurried in Scotland’s horrific hilly landscape, which offers the scene to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinematic enthusiasts interested in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It’s good if the film has more target groups, it’s only a shame when they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers, Pusher, is considered a Danish version of the director Quentin Tarantino, but is Stoically prevented from bringing his works closer to either the main stream or less brutality of the artistic audience.
Most of the fans of art cinema seem to be discouraged everywhere by spraying brains and internalities.
The supporters of action films will be bored at the latest at the moment when the One Eye will go out for freely explained reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will remain hanging for all eternity in the wind and fog before the team appears to be adding to America and remain silent there.
It’s no surprise, then, that he didn’t get into cinema in Germany, and now he was only released on DVD.
It’s a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind a particular facade, places to the broken blood, there’s an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or an exact event, everything is an atmosphere, a bitter dream that has become a film.
And it's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn will not allow him a moment of release and slowly suffocate him with his freezing shots and a cloud hypnotic soundtrack, but above all an indescribable hatred that flows from the heart of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One Eye retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all the most one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and transitional allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It creates destruction, but perhaps only for the wicked.
“Walhalla Rising is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement, and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious Earth Works
The IAEA has a new warning on the secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is opposed to expression - and will not allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shores of Euphrates; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA) show its name when it comes to a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns from the current.
On the basis of a statement from the US-American foreign intelligence service CIA in late April 2008, a reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would well be thrown into the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technique of the 1950s is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the reactor components could have been before the destruction, a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, still submitted photographs showing the building close or even from the inside.
The reactor was reportedly shortly before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, they don’t know much more than they did then, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no evidence that the country had an active nuclear weapons program.
Some intelligence reporters in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a “stupid reactor”, although the CIA’s presentation considers it “trustworthy”
They lack clear evidence as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure he has a reactor ahead of him, the UN high diplomat answered in summer, the IAEA said it had enough material to ask questions.
Suji reportedly - unused military buildings - the Syrians were quickly cleared and also properly leveled the terrain.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team managed by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite photographs of commercial dealers from the time just after the attack, which should be more appropriate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market because they are exclusively bought by an unknown customer - maybe Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, this was reversed by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss things - as well as satellite shots.
In addition, it banned the reviewers from second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombarded building.
Israel is also silent.
“We will never comment,” said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unceasingly since June 2008, and it is “increasing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office”, as the high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted, after all, it is a serious breach of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons overseeing by the IAEA.
The IAEA considers it a key to progress in the matter of three other devices to be, in a functional connection, with the alleged reactor, and, unlike it, still exist.
The reviewers have not yet stated which equipment they are talking about or why they are suspected.
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite imagery, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's approach to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be pre-sented to the U.S. to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to facilities by the U.S. secret service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite images that the material was transported here and there between these three sites and the square at Euphrates.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one should be furnished in connection with fuel production.
However, there is no evidence of sensitive activities - that is, about enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But from where the uranium comes from, and where the plutonium should later be broken down into a bomb, there are only possible estimates on these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the ruins that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of truck costs have disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to have information about where the sum got to.
Only a few kilometers from the el-Kibar remote and on the other side of the Euphrates located salt mine al-Tibni, which had allowed Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable storage for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in connection with the reactor in one satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the images from space show that after IAEA required access, Syria carried out all suspicious earthwork sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, he talks about diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for revisions that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest of the reviewers is.
Damascus has rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna have calmed down a year ago that the reactor has been destroyed, and this is why it doesn’t burn, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Daisy has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means that the Vienna Nuclear Office has to enforce controls.
The head of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already talked about “the possibilities that I’m leaning on in the future,” but he is still hesitant.
This election poses a great risk: On the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: ‘What happens when they find nothing?’
Love in the War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on the still nameless directing primordial in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, it is the love story of a woman from Bosnia and the man from Serbia.
Not much more is known yet - but it also causes restlessness.
It is said that the woman who is a Muslim falls in love during the war in Yugoslavia with the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the planned film moved quickly from Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnian.
Bakira Hasecic, from the Organization of Women's War Victims, wrote through the UN-organization to help refugees of UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, now reported the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also an ambassador of the UN-organization to help refugees.
It is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where the rape took place, love stories did not take place, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization has therefore recommended the UN refugee assistance organisation to release Jolie as ambassador, according to the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read its script, allowed filming after smaller tahanics in Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie did not yet come.
The young author emphasizes that in her film she does not pursue any political intentions, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war began and will meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is thrown into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than--the victim of the rape falls in love with his martyr--
The fact that the film Jolie really begins before the war is true.
Jolie argues that pressure is being exerted on it, which is “not fair and is based on false information.”
She is now freed from Hollywood by helicopters: by publishing her script illegally on the internet, as she has done many times.
Nothing but gone
It's good for Ira again this evening.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates power greatly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream with joy for the sound of loud music, ass-foot.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork is boiling because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and they hit.
“Beer pong” is called the bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and to do so tickets to Las Vegas at the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this quivered beer game and a relentless informatic, it doesn’t get any better together.
However, a 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, to respond from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, he's going to an interview in New Zealand in January.
“I have such a strange feeling,” he says.
“It’s so far away and I don’t have a job there yet.”
Still, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - 'she immediately got her dream job as Event Manager, maybe it's a good sign - says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two out of three tanner siblings have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
The boys are leaving: Just like the tanners, it looks like it's in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people leave the country in the near future, experts at the ESRI Institute for Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin predict.
They even count on 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar emigration wave as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After decades of ascension, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, the incompetence is now expanding again.
The economic crisis is mainly detected by young, educated Irish people who have experienced only the rise so far.
The loss of employment and social downturn seemed absurd in these years.
Everyone needed money, money was too much.
In the meantime, there are three out of ten women and men under thirty years of age without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: “In Ireland, everything goes from hill to hill.”
\"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, who goes away and our country loses a whole generation -\"
“The last thing I ask is to turn it off.”
Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future blackly because the government is only lying to young people and does not offer any views for the future.
“They are reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
She observes how her classmates are motivating from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out herself in four years.
This thought is sad and depressing.
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the WorkingAbroadExpo exhibition, which offers overall service on the subject of work abroad.
“For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career chart,” says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build somewhere else, he's known to Seán O'Donovan for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to be able to repay a home loan.
“The situation is sometimes a bit crazy,” he says, when the first time in a long time it exceeds the threshold of its own house.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I’m not, in fact, at all.”
He laughs and walks in cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, in the entrances parking large expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent funded by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it might not be good with the loan?
O'Donovan is thinking for a while, drinking hot tea and saying, \"I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over again.\"
The engineer doesn’t like to complain, which he hears so often now.
“No one needs to be hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on this island,” he says.
\"It's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Irish.\"
He laughs and then tells of his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
“After seven years, he was back again, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keeping the future open and simply waiting for life to evolve elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years now, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there’s one more thing that bothers him enough these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn to a farewell party.
“No emotions,” he says, drinking beer.
\"Bye, that sounds worrying.\"
“We’ll call it a party of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as promoting private entrepreneurship.
Criminal activity raises more concern than unemployment.
And many regions consider Brazil more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobarómero, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been taking place regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the entire area.
In this year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries at the Pacific border in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where there has been an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which downloads the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in their country in practice, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it was a big increase (graf 3).
About 34% said they trust the House in their country and 45% trust the government, they are again the same figures as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy undermined the economic crisis in Latin America.
The support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and this year again to 32%.)
However, the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see Figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luize Inacia Luly da Silva, are reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America are seen as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see chart 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to the figure of 38% last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private business and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the whole area say private business is essential for development, this percentage has increased from 56% from 2007 (see chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has increased from 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing President Hugo Chavez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is a leading country in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, versus last year's unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, versus 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti to be perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections meant filling urns and repetitive votes, voting tickets scattered across channels, broken electoral rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved due to the January earthquake, wandered around and tried to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a few forecasting predecessors, shouted that it was a scam and called for an end to the election.
Protests, some of them of violent character, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that “in many ways it was a pretty good election.”
The observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community carefully said that “they do not believe that, however serious these irregularities were, they did not necessarily have to cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Mirande Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from their original call to declare the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among the voters, is marked by the Electoral Commission for having achieved a decisive struggle.
Due to an epidemic of cholera and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were concerns that electoral participation would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganization they were prevented from doing so.
Around 250,000 ID cards that are necessary for the vote remained undistributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians will be able to do so themselves.
After the tips to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, benefits from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, the conversion of this success in the successful campaign for the second term of office in the next year may depend on Mrs Fernández giving up the uncompromisingness of her deceased husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend more income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most of it last year in Congress.
But the opposition was divided and further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner for a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (in which the government was falsified and accused of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
“I don’t want to stay,” the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply next year, with the president spending more space at will.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% is likely to grow this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about the number that is approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina suffered economic collapse, set priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared the INDEC, a statistical agency that had joined the surveillance of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández moderate this policy now?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on great devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is knowing that she wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government created an agreement with bond holders who had previously rejected the restructuring of debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Today, President Fernández is faced with a deal with the creditors’ governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this is not the case with the IMF, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer-price index that will remind the introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to stay in politics after the end of the term of office when the husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer holiday in March, the wave of sympathy will fall apart.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to quietly abandon the many views her husband held in politics.
Half encouragement for China
The Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think about her big brother over the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible voters, voted on 27 November by the mayor and council of the city in five districts, which can be seen as a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jea.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that predominate to the mainland and have a strong position in business relationships, including the agreement on partially free trade, in the greatest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President, he passed the test, but only close.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three out of five mayors, she was unable to win most of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to increase Taiwan's independence, has won almost 50% of all votes against the 45% KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, the president would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s vote has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with the KMT in the city councils.
The election took place as most of the Taiwan elections, which include noisy electoral trucks and mass gatherings with flags with disputed girls.
There was even a mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary chairman of the KMT, was to agitate for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly across his face, hurt him, and killed a spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates agreed on plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
KMT tends to avoid government ties in Beijing.
This time, however, the DPP also abandoned the excitation of anti-China attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma has confirmed that China’s policy is acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue in commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to set up a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It would be better to wait for the presidential election in 2012.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President in 2000-08 was a stormer and advocate of clear independence.
But under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, moderate and DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-change, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything possible to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “trustworthy alternative” to Mr. Ma’s comforted approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would succeed better if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was bad, despite the intricate pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says he's reorganizing his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for the establishment of friendships are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, “a point from which there is no return has already passed”
Grammy Award nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
A speech at the request of the president and people must be legally noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is described as one of the Grammy Awards this year with nominations for the best new artist.
Since Spalding was celebrated on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album “Esperanza” was released, the nomination came a little late, but it’s in line with Grammy’s rules, where the artist can’t release more than three albums before a public identity of a given artist is established.
Her 2010 ambitious album, the Chamber Music Society, has certainly taken a step forward, and thanks to her careless vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, funku and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to the Grammy voters who have been looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Other Grammy judges rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio-Historicity in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing journey of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against James Moody’s experienced saxophonist Moody 4B and John Beasley’s “Positootly” keyboardist
Trombone Shorty, a savvy New Orleans favorite and frequent HBO-Treme guest, was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group \"Darcy\" James Argue's Secret Society, with the knowledge of steampunk, has won several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large files, when in competition the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still the bold Dave Holland, whose live album with octet-Pathways, created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandmate.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daughterty, Steve Mackey lead in the category of classical music
The classical music nominations have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd Grammy Awards.
Michael Daugherty and his ‘Deus Ex Machina’ for piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album ‘Dreamhouse’, an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among those nominated for Southern California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4-Los Angeles, a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
Categories for classical music producers of the year have five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
He was nominated for a classical album by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughterrty and his ‘Deus Ex Machina’ and ‘Metropolis Symphony’ by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his ‘Dreamhouse’ from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; ‘Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati’ by various artists; and Verdi-Requiem by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of the opera, the nominees are Berg and Lulu, by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and Marc Antonio e Cleopatra, by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and L'Amour de Loin, by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and the Enchanted Wanda, by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and Ivanhoe, by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are nominated for the Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daughterty for ‘Deus Ex Machina,’ Hans Werner Henze for ‘Appassionatamente Plus,’ Magnus Lindberg for ‘Grafiti’ and Shchedrin for ‘The Enchanted Wandaer’.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the cover of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
About 30 minutes of work is called \"Los Angeles\" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and Mandolin Concerto were nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with an orchestra.
A composer from L.A. said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for Mandolin artist Avivitala, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York City.
“I wrote this with the help of the Middle East tones and many North African rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated for orchestral performance, for Chicago Symphony's lead in the recording of Stravinsky's work.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, soprano Jessye Norman won the nomination for her recording, \"Roots - My Life, My Song\"
The planned mosque in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimity of support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
\"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember,\" said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
\"I am very proud of it as an American citizen.\"
It means justice will always win.
“The opposition is minimal,” he added.
“Those who are opposed only cry out loudly.”
“We have really good people in our valley.”
The negotiations began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time they took up discussions with people who were pro or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
“There is no America anymore,” one comment appeared.
“We are the Planet of the Monkey with the Statue of Liberty,” he said.
America has fallen.
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, a place of tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York City.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community, reading approximately 135 families, spent years without incident in Riverside County, but wanted more and more suitable space than the storage space he rented together with the filter system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the city council regarding the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth, claiming that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been previously considered and fundamental.
This organism has a dual ability.
It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic.
“This fact is very strange, but it’s not proof that it’s a form of truly ‘foreign’ life,” said Paul C. W. Daisy of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online issue of Science.
It has long been considered essential for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California are able to continue to grow after the arsenic replaces phosphorus.
“You’ll start to be amazed at what’s still possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside of Earth, because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this news published to discuss it, which did not reveal details of the finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
“The discovery shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements we consider ‘standard’ may not be so absolutely necessary for life,” said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
“This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another element in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It wasn't a random finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon at NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, thus considering that the microb, which is exposed to both elements, may be able to replace one another.
Arzen is toxic mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus.
As a result, organisms can very difficult to separate these elements from each other.
“However, arsenic is so different that as phosphorus does not work. When it enters the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes,” Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the action of phosphorus, but since they can survive also with arsenic replacement, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that he could use earlier forms of life.
“This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early period of the Earth,” Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simo’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower Motel were found, reported to the Los Angeles Sheriff on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akites and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, the authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs were then discovered on Wednesday late in the evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department.
“The good news is that dogs are okay,” Whitmore said.
They are in good condition.
They were handed over to their rightful owners.
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found in what location, as well as did not share detailed information about their finding.
The investigation continues -
“We don’t want to talk about it,” Whitmore said.
We follow the rules -
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught up to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two Akites were found in Downey's shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
The Sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace, and the 10-month-old Didi, were uninjured, the authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the breeds of Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unfounded until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to take part in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions planned in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
South California is just one stop at a couple’s nearly monthly travel after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard joined the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the boxer's puppy, the Parson Russell Terrier and the Bretan Hound - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh Corgis left in a car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who introduced them to missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether the awards would be awarded.
The lion is again ready to scream now that the restructuring of the MGM obtains final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got green to start over.
On Thursday, the federal insolvency judge of New York officially blessed a “pre-packed” plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt to clear the way for a 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
On Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order, there are no legal obstacles to the MGM to re-launch the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main managers of the slimming study.
The number of employees decreases to around 320 from the original over 400.
The MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on the planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new MGM operations and production.
It is now connected to an investment bank that itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management fought to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009 they would sell the company.
Although the auction attracted several stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion of US dollars plus the funds requested by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which collect $375,000 per month for their services that run the company, will receive a “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to renew production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to take part in the funding of two films, the theme of which will be the book “Hobit”, together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, sought to merge studies with Lions Gate Entertainment, the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget Balanced
This year’s leading candidate is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system, but in both cases it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99, and one Kinect game costs just like 10 beads or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget in balance for gifts.
I recently visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys-R - Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s law was working; this year’s technology toys had far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to last years.
While relatively fewer new toys appeared with affiliated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries increases, as well as toys with batteries charging.
Here are some recommendations.
(All of the above prices are from Toys-R-US, except for cases that are otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years old) are plush animals that sing when you press their belly.
At one press, the pet will release a tone, and the other will start to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start a cat, you can’t stop.
Best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animatric doll at Elmo Live Technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk monthly thanks to its innovative folding foot with bike blocking.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain of lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you may remember Alphia, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3 years of age), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn the car into fun with working with a self-correct, funny workbook.
If you are pushing your smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with a simple use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have as effective instruction as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of the Leapster range from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years of age) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years of age) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than the match box, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before the time expires; it is great for competing in improvised word making.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys by Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented in the toy industry.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin - Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains a hidden-code coin.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or pet Puffle.
A little bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$ for children from 5 years), the latest in a range of button battery microrobots.
The brown moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny if you make a maze out of the cubes and see if he can find a way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off with the kitchen table and spend even some time in the mouth of our dog.
Introduction of finer police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders semi-voicely with military authority.
He wanted women's ankles - the Chinese state-owned ecclesiasticals of urban order, feared and despised for their hard interventions and adversity in violence - to convey a certain impression on the deafness of the passersby.
- Stand up straight -
- Hurry up -
Show them, whisper silently, 'what nice girls look like'
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as per ruler.
Four head covers perfectly sit on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
“I think they look average,” Mr. Tang said.
The models are nice.
More than one government has sought to revive the image of city supervisors in China.
One city ordered new goalkeepers to have higher education.
Guangdong Province has changed gray-green uniforms to allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced strong-armed views: in 2009, it was reported that 50 officers surrounded the cart with snacks and looked at the owners closely until the dealer had packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a district with 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose an operation as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has complemented its city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, disproportionateity and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the thick side of the police, a more subtle, feminine side.
However, Scarlett Johansson himself would find it difficult to get into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police are allowed only to enforce the municipal decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media routinely captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province stunned an uninvolved spectator to death after using his cell phone to film, as they did in the case of a protest against the landfill.
Last year, there was training of police officers in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual there was, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year, a submersible melon merchant in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injury to the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet shows Chinese police officers attacking a street dealer.
“Chengguan scared the government,” China Daily, a national edition, lamented last year after a further debate on tactics.
On paper, there was a very thorough cleaning.
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the county advertised an interest in eight new female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News reported on whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district required female candidates aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and -five facial features in the correct proportion -
Adaptations should be higher than the diameter - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials say work is mentally too difficult for women over 25 years old.
“His image is an important thing,” said one unsolicited police officer at Rednet.com, as if government websites.
Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which are then determined by others, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.
Then comes a number of natures and - internal qualities -
Women are like floral vases, he said and added, “In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of District City Management, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that height requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both genders.
As well as a requirement for the relative features of the face.
Which means that the question of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
“He can’t allow us to serve as a chrome or gloomy man,” said Mr. Zheng.
“His image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who holds a patrol on Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like an apple and gently shaped mouth.
She does not think that the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist character, she said.
“You think I look sexy in this uniform,” she asked with an irony look.
Her co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says: “Our job is to represent the image of the city.”
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just pushing traders into the aisles where they can carry out their activities.
Each morning, a group stands up against more than ten marketers who are running on foot or on wheels and trying to sell as many cloves and tofu bowls as possible before they are expelled.
“Mr. Wang, you have to leave.”
“We’ve already told you that many times,” said Miss Xu, when the marketer started running, and for a time left his bike with a cart with the boring.
The police describe their duties as more monotonous than demanding.
“Each day is basically the same thing,” said Huang Jing, 20 who studies in his free marketing.
The Great Routine
One of the reasons is that female policemen do not have powers as their male counterparts so that the goods can be entertained by sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency then protects them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumors spread about police killing the dealer.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers had patrols that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The police seized a motorcycle that was repaired on the pavement instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute walk from the police, looking angry, with elbows against vehicles and quickly gone with a motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” said Mr. Li.
“It’s usually the public that starts with it.
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleaned Senator John Ensign of criminal charges concerning his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator said Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Nevadan Republican, faced and who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 president. His affair came into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was pleased with the decision that followed almost a year after the investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings with the Senate's ethical committee.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice “we informed that Senator Ensign will no longer be the purpose of the investigation and that there is no plan to raise further charges against him in this matter”
The Ministry of Justice has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were published in the New York Times in October 2009 said Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, provide a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthie, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a cashier in Ensign's campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton had been hired to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews have been reported.
Since Hampton was Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was excluded from lobbying by his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton’s unusual settlement, who had been friends before the affair, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
“The evidence that has been published revealed to be a clear case of law-making,” Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients who are being investigated by the government, said in a statement.
While officials at the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other experts specializing in ethics said that the ministry was cautious about political actions, after a large number of failures, including the decision of last year to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of charges of the state prosecutorship.
“Federal prosecutors have clearly hidden their weapons,” said Melania Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign on the matter.
“It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not subject to laws,” she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had been called by the State Secretary of Justice on Monday and the next day, and told him that the ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s defense team is working with the prosecutor to convince him that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, was acting in accordance with the law.
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he gave to the public prosecutors.
“I am not happy to describe the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop an investigation into a separate complaint, in which an ethical group filed charges that Ensign’s parents’ payment to Hamptons at $96.000 violated the federal electoral law.
The election committee said it had insufficient evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find his lobby work was NV Energy, the main company in Nevada that has long supported the senator.
A December 2008 e-mail showed that after Mr. Hampton began working as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, had been communicating with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had been \"snacking\" to the Interior Ministry on the subject.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevadan client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobby work.
When the Afre first appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he was planning to take part in the third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign was no longer the purpose of the criminal investigation by his spokesman Jennifer Cooper, the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and put an end to the entire investigation.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire's call to Twitter
She wrote half a dozen of them in the ranks of the court.
A minute later, they sent news of a terrible testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages were dealing with rape and attachment of children to beds in a house that was inflamed.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, family, was to be reinstated and an official end to the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed an appeal with requests and arguments that the court would likely have employed for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a “circus atmosphere” and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with turbulent details then introduced a jury in decision-making in terms of public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to deal with the question of whether the onset of new technologies would also require new rules in the court.
“As I have experienced in this recalculation, I think there is a real danger that the integration of new technologies in the judicial court affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the case, Jon C. Blue, briefly rejected the State Supreme Court’s claim regarding the last week’s revenue and the fact that the media were ‘safely controlled’ and that there was no evidence showing that the jury acted under public influence.
This is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have acknowledged that reporting on notorious cases can raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the media trial was a ‘carnival atmosphere’.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration of a TV show and a film \"Refugee\"
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts that reviewed Hayes’s judgment half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine the way they communicate from the courts, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
“There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media,” said John J. Donohue III, a law professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was executed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges might be interested in the idea that limiting direct communication from the courts could make the trial more fair.
The case of Twitter is just one of Mr. Hayes's many portrayed lawyers who would be able to argue for years to refrain from executing the judgment.
For example, the defenders also claim that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it may be a bias when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them criminal photographs of horror when choosing a jury.
Some of the judges said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, which Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenders argue that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge has misappropriated the judge, who was critical of state prosecutors, and that he has misappropriated the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict raised last month that the case dominated the Connecticut reports and was discussed during the election campaign by the U.S. Governor and Senate candidates.
They argued that the media were constantly blowing flames of emotion on the matter.
“The daily rush of media, cameras, and reporters in court,” a lawyer wrote, “was something that was not yet visible in New Haven, and it may also be a national rarity.”
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists claimed that immediate reporting was more outraged than the reports mentioned later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should follow the scope of other proceedings.
But some lawyers demanded appeal courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes required the adaptation of courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes seek this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court’s decision on Dr. Sheppard’s judgment, due to the breadth of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media required new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was remarkable by its insults and negativeism, this week a small amount of politeness appeared in Washington.
Is this the first patch of true cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to a party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring any major discoveries on the key issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a courteous discussion of two-party opinion differences, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party entanglement.
The central public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close co-operation for several months has built mutual respect beyond the ideological abyss that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they probe each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, seeking to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday’s hearing and its subsequent evaluation by the participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the circumstances that have been in place for the last two years.
Whether it’s a question of taxation, spending, healthcare or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at Ethics and Public Policy Center.
They are inevitable after the election.
The elections outraged the emotions of the party, and then silenced them.
It's good -
On several issues, especially those to discuss at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts at the end of the year have expired and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them permanently or temporarily.
Like a likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot look at how they support tax cuts for the property, while the unemployed refuse unemployment support.
After the White House negotiations on Tuesday, there is already more optimism regarding possible agreements on these issues, together with ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when the 112st Congress convenes on January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
“After doing things that have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that politeness will lead to real cooperation.
“I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012,” he said.
The reasons are largely related to the compilation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders are now facing the danger of exaggeration, they know that they must act according to their promises and they must reduce government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These support lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations that include tax reform and increases in some taxes, increased retirement age and reduced spending.
Joint Chairmans Alan Simpson and Erskin Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, to put pressure on the deficit issue for a public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee in order to be able to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to approach this number as close as possible.
The biggest resistance is between elected officials in the jury who suggest that we have, at least today, small foundations or wills for compromise in the case of financial issues.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to solve the budget, taxes and health care, when a period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What will cause the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite partyism at the last election, most Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
If it could go to the heel, as was the case in 1995, then both parties will closely monitor the public’s reactions.
Anyone who threatens to reduce votes will probably change the course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of the matter.
The party and the guidelines today are bigger than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republicans than in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the politeness that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
The American document depicts Moscow as a refuge of corruption.
The city’s management is in the hands of the “cliptocracy”, and it continues with parts of bribery and bribery for protection coming to Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in the records from February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service hold protective wings to a large extent, which help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the 'vertical office' - will take its own when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redigated.
The record was written at a time when he was still mayor of Yuri Luzhkov and accused him of a large share of corruption.
He was revoked in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in purification.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have been constantly denying allegations of corruption for many years, and won several lawsuits for such a charge.
In September, he said on a Russian television station when he was asked about the proven testimony of corruption: “It’s crazy, it’s dirt, it’s shit.”
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be voting.
However, it is unusual to meet such details spoken in such a manner, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
“The government of the city of Moscow and its connection with criminal elements have led some to call it ‘disfunctional,’ and to confirm that the government is more like kleptocracy than government,” the report said.
“Criminal elements enjoy the so-called ‘krysha’ (a term from the world of crime and the mafia that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the State Representative, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
Analysts identified and three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow
Luzhkov is at the top of the mountain.
Federal Security Service, Ministry of the Interior and Militia are at second stage.
And finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors.
It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty places in some areas, since the city does not provide some services.
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, “Business owners in Moscow are aware that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course.
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself can already have problems; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their trades are closed under different pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had only made little progress.
The embassy report talks about men taking suitcases, probably inflated with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats,” he said in a recent interview with George Satarov, director of Moscow’s research team Indem.
It is part of this bureaucracy.
It is not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia.
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year nationwide.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the land is sorted from least to the most corrupt).
The discovery of a report by the U.S. Embassy, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening, certainly did not provoke enthusiasm at the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be accused of Moscow’s shortcomings, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue on the matter of solving the problem.
In an interview with CNN, he told Mr. Putin that the documents WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeits and reacted angryly to the statement that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth about the whole matter is that it is our mutual co-operation, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethically.”
Red Khmer veterans are forced to deal with the past
In a dispute-lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, school director Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
Everyone here loves Ta Moka.
“He was a good leader and took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the \"cutler\" for its surrogacy during the government of the Khmer Reds, the commander remains in this remote possession of the Khmer Reds in northwestern Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Rudi Khmers gave up the government, a long-lasting loyalty is also in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims in the truth and reconciliation forum were allowed to publicly confront those who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining the history of the Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, together, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court held the first condemnation of a former member of the Red Khmers, the judgment of a former leader, a notoriously known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With all such progress, unrest grew among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which makes it difficult to try to reconcile and rejoin Cambodian society.
“Among the former Khmer Reds is envy and fear, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
For them, the life between the Khmer Reds was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil.
It divides families -
During the government of the Khmer Reds in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million people were killed or died of hunger, illness or rework.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remains of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began a uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary managed partisan wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, following a peace deal sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their deputies no longer cared for them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unqualified farmers.
“These people had only minimal benefits from surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, led by a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.
They were brought up without any idea of making a trade.
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled down as a poor farmer in 1998.
“Life under the Red Khmers was good,” he said.
“That Mok took all of them”
“But now life is hard, because we have to secure everything ourselves.”
The running Red Khmer court has also raised concerns.
In the beginning of next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Secretary of the Red Khmers.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the head of the coupor and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in these four cases as well.
It was little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the government of the Red Khmers in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Last night, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden cottage on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend, and shadows appeared across the bleak grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Reds.
If the court called her, she would refuse to go.
“In Cambodia, peace reigns and is stable,” she said.
“If further prosecutions appear, there will be war”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed from the Khmer Reds in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought further suspicions, although experts and historians disagreed.
“Camboda must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it,” he said.
But confrontation with the past is only what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer conditions means blinding broken pieces,” he said.
It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand.
The Center issued the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and the title ‘History of Democratic Cambodia’
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Reds.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew very little details about the Khmers, despite connecting the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he took home the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts,” he said.
They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be prosecuted by the court.
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, textbooks and court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmers still have a strong spell.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains, the road is covered with weed, and is filled with thrown plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black soots, covered with a pruning metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone dealer at the edge of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was sunk at the place.
“He has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him,” she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of mature bananas in the hope of bringing her happiness.
Belarus Agrees It Looks Like Its Uranium-Based Arms Stock
In a surprising victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its supply of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the Security Summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martyn.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up the highly enriched uranium and to appear to have hit the stone last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a couple of covert operations had been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of the Obama 47th National Summit on Nuclear Safety in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to a follow-up summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 nuclear safety summit.”
“This proves that the process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety group.
Clinton called the deal “a very important, important step” from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their supplies of high-enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of the Obama nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
\"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium,\" Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity... we’re not going to make dirty bombs and we’re not going to sell it to anyone, either.”
We only use it for research purposes, that’s all.
Belarus, however, joined the United States a few months ago and showed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was lightly lit, officials said.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of which are less enriched uranium to deliver to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust, which led to an agreement signed by Clinton,” said Andrew Beniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint statement, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
“We welcome the progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is essential for the progress of the country and its people,” he said.
The Spanish government did not make expensive flights to the CIA
The Spanish government did not make any gems about CIA flights carrying the imprisoned Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guantánama via the Spanish territory, as stated in its telegram by the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
Thus, it follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, where it is also written that then Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vegová asked the Spanish executive to be informed and thus to show that she has due supervision of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace.
In June 2006, a meeting was held between U.S. Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vegova, following the Council of Europe’s communication, which accused dozens of countries including Spain of participating in human rights violations.
The Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication \"was removing Zapater's government from the game\" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
De la Vegová stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
“They simply want to be informed, so that they don’t,” Aguirre says, in one of the documents.
Even then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos suggested to the U.S. ambassadors that the Spanish government wanted to give as little outline as possible, but by having been in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited options for influence.
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he did not intend to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Center for Secret Services (CNI) and the Department of Defense concerning CIA flights.
“This information does not contain any incriminated file or sensitive information,” the embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concerns about the obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors rather than the declassification of CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent experts will make our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of lunch, U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, said the ambassadors that, although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they consider appropriate, they have already given instructions to their co-workers to avoid angry comments with the intention of reducing tensions.
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political actions of Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party) in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that Zapater’s government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potentially human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the U.S. government.”
A mother-mother-murder has complained on the network of mother-care.
The young woman talked about the baby when she was dead, and she had her blog: ‘Teror in Galician’
Monica Juanatey Fernández calls herself “Muki” on the Internet
with this nickname, which she had been using since she was young, she was communicating with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Corunia, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which the ABC newspaper rebuilds with the help of the testimony of her family members.
In 1998, a 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez.
They've been together for one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his former girlfriend never let DNA tests.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
She was chosen by Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
The little César lived with them.
When the girl left for Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to see her for a week in Palma.
However, from the content of her communication, it is evident that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: 'Alberto is some kind of angry that I left for work'
“When I told him it seemed good, but now he realizes that he has to be with a little all day and can’t do what he wants.”
Then she talks about the SMS message she just received: ‘I want you to come back this month or give me the address where to send you a child’
He complains, “If he doesn’t like me leaving a little one with my mother, I’ll take it when I get back,” he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his home: ‘I’m going to go there this week, but I’m only going to stay until 19, because I have to go to work 20 so I don’t lose it.’
He explains that if everything goes well, he will take his son to himself.
She will be with whom she is to be with, that is, with me, and never again in her life will I leave him with someone else except my mother - a dubious intention due to her bad relationships.
There is another post in July.
When he pulls out this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
The Emperor is satisfied on the one hand, but on the other he is not -
“On the one hand, he’s with me and he’s pretty much like it here, but on the other hand, he’s going to school almost every day.”
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
“He’ll go there to the summer school, so I’ll save some money for a nurse.”
Seventeen greetings and complaints.
“A great mouth from Caesar, who asks me when to come.”
Alberto says he sent you no videos to email, see how he wants, meet me, sex is needed.
The Thirty-Fifth Next Report: “The boy is well, going to summer school to learn Catalan”
There's also one report about the more recent partner: \"Gives me money.\"
On the Internet there are Monika's posts on the blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she kept saying, ‘Muki ex-prisoner.’
-Teror in Galician (motto).
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe that everything would happen because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma, where she arrived from the Menorca detention center.
A lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant does not remember how everything happened and that he did not intend to hurt a small child somehow.
But before that, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bath and put his body in the trunk.
The defense and prosecutor ask for a psychiatric examination.
The people would have won 4 seats in the House, and the PCS (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would have lost 9 mandates.
With the results of November 28th, the PP party could have the main word at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes and the number of experienced Members during the recent Autonomous Elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia) already has an idea of general elections, whether they increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in nationwide elections is usually one such versus the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan peoples received 610.473 votes in general, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316222.
Last Sunday, PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this trend of extradition, supported by the transfer of votes from the TSO and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if elections were held, the PPC could obtain 12 MPs in the House compared to the existing 8, the CIU party (Convergence i Unió, the Czech Concord and the Union) would also receive 4 mandates (now 10) and the PCS would lose at least 9 seats (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is essential for the parties of PP and PSOE (Spain’s Socialist Workers’ Party).
According to this analysis, the People's Party of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one or another mandate.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest installment will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where people could also have a decisive impact on the end of the ruling of socialists in four major provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest anticipated budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and peoples agree with the possibility that the city hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive the majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC parties and the ICV.
Due to the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Council - since at least 5% of the votes have to be won.
The PP Party has increased the number of votes received in four capitals and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turn in Tarragon, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP won only 500 more votes than the PCS, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also gained at other major cities such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
At present, PP is represented at 34 cities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell has provided Al-Qaeda with thousands of passports.
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were arrested in Thailand.
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian who had been detained by the General Information Commissioner’s agents in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of Al-Qaeda, among which were also “Typians of the Liberation of Tamil Ilam,” or “Lashkar-e-Taiba,” while the other group was the author of the bombings in Mumbai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure, with the help of Operation Kampai, the weakening of Al Qaeda’s counterfeiting apparatus at international level, and thus to limit its operational capabilities.
Investigators estimate that this cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years when it was active in Catalonia, then counterfeited and then delivered to groups that form the criminal galaxy of Al Qaeda to allow their “fighters” to travel unpunishedly across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe and therefore other European police forces participated in these investigations, in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that there would be similar interventions in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad, and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) another developed in Thailand, where Pakistanis were captured by Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was these men who drove from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, they had to have been valid for several years and were without a marked visa.
In the investigation documents, it is stressed that no facts have yet been known that would link the detainees from Catalonia to the attack in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, Lashkar-e-Taiba, should have been one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the attack, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia to buy cards on mobile phones, which were later used by members of the command that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demands Mas to stop the fiscal deal
The President of the PPC Party (The People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity to personally present to Arthur Mas her conditions under which she is willing to support his introduction into the office of President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and of risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wishes to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan peoples came to meet Arthur Mas with the certainty of the 18 parliamentary seats received in last Sunday’s elections, which is more than satisfactory to gain popularity, so the candidate of the CIU needs to abstain from voting on his accession to office at least one of the opposition formations.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists would like to keep in the House until general elections are held, but so far the talks that have been held these days with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for President PP, in order to gain her support for taking office, she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberating manifestations, as well as to an economic agreement, similar to that of Basque, which CIU’s leader wanted to even vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the over-the-counter political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations regarding Masova's introduction into office will be dealt with within the framework of PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat DMT).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of the lack of measures.
Olot Center shows do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric centre of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to describe what damage caused the crime institution to Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who, in the meantime, was employed here, killed at least eleven seniors he had taken care of.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala appeared in the advocacy of the facility lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that “the wish of La Caritat’s home would be to be able to raise charges against the guilty - responsible for killing, but “legalty and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities.”
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer due to the fact that it did not detect the criminal activity of the caregiver in a timely manner, the great threat to La Caritat’s home is now the requirements for material compensation, which are already calculated by legal representatives of the families of the deceased.
Joan Vila Dilmé admits that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the clients of the home for seniors, suspecting that in many cases no doctor was examined personally by the deceased, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was dealt with on the phone.
La Caritat, through her director, rejected this extremeity and stressed that “the lack of measures could not in any way be the cause of what happened.”
La Caritat’s attorney added that “there is no indication in the case that, in addition to the accused’s own, any third party would commit a mistake”
A man now known as the Angel of Death admitted 11 deaths yesterday and specified that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed the second old woman.
In this case, death caused by the administration of too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case when using a mixture of calming tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff’s access to medication.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably in six cases of the nine means used by this caregiver to kill patients in their attempt to relieve them of suffering.
However, only the analyses that are currently taking place in the lab should show whether Villa is lying and has actually sought less cruel death for her first victim or, on the contrary, killed them by lying, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in health claims, nor do they rule out that the number of killed may be higher than he has admitted to, and justify his behavior in various versions, which Vila has filed with the knowledge that he must change his actions when it has been revealed that he has killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be available to justice to illuminate the entire scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Investors have reacted sharply to the European Central Bank President Trichet’s threat yesterday, which warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to respond”
Border differentials were closed with force, and European bank shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although the decline occurs, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as taking back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank called for an end to the plan to buy-out state debt for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity rates within a period of time and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate of the forecast to be at least by March, and will follow a three-month bid with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and that they will even announce its intensification.
If they fail to meet the expectations created, they will re-create the response of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw the liquidity rate, God will be with us!
The same was true at the convention in May, where they claimed that they did not even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, she announced the armored fist on Monday and said on Wednesday that she had already bought many of them, causing a further collapse of the market.
Last year's conversion to one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in mood in the market that took place after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem has not been identified by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to obtain approval of the new budget by the parliament and still lack sufficient support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel eased the tone of her speech to release tensions in the face for the next EU summit held on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would rather be Beethoven’s Ode to joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of measures that would be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatization, measures to revive employment - into the ears of investors it sounds like a four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased 4.5%, or twice as much as the other European exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing - we probably benefit from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key bond bid for three years, which will be favored by the effect of Trichet, which we hope for, will be a great demand for it, which will help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would close our sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of the woman of the Emperor - not only to be that, but also to seem -
We can do it.
President of the Eulen Group attacks Vega Sicilia talks requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, neutikha.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after taking it as “an entirely insignificant” legal act of El Enebro planned for the 16th of this month, and the five of his seven descendants, on whom they should try to force their majority and seize themselves with the help of the administrative bodies of the public prosecutors of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the domination of a part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem willing to hunt in his dispute about membership in the ruling bodies of the El Enebro group.
Five of its seven descendants, who were named leaders during the shareholders’ meeting on 18 January of this year, were composed of its administrative committee, and whose objection is placed in the Commercial Register.
The trial of the El Enebro Group scheduled for the sixteenth month, which was convened by Commercial Court Officer No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the hrefaction in the womb of the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means to guarantee the commission's convocation until the dispute is resolved.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Álvarez Mezquiriz is considered by David Álvarez as a desperate means of his five children serving by means of judicial lity and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the conduct of January 18th, which was completely invalid.
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this act as a ‘totally insignificant’.
The protagonists themselves, who remain discreetly silent, tried without success to convene the court in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned alongside other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% capital.
However, the founder of the group, according to family protocols, requires the right to use 51% of the capital.
This case is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when recalculate the issue of a judicial assault.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
The software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Since Red Bull fell into Formula One in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new incoming team, and despite the rising tendency of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alons.
Without reducing the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 a legend was born - a secret weapon - which the multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful march simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for the purpose of very remote automotive sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for devices with high precision.
Its purpose is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenditures.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, the head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to perform - in a matter of hours, in almost real time - modification and improvement, which are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology who analyze and design every type of car modification.
The CEO of Siemens explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicle except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical convenience is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set up about 50 km from London a race of cutting-edge technologies to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings where visitors are restricted - especially journalists.
Everything that takes place here is considered a “great secret.”
The list of participants in this project consists of 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is undoubtedly the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, other protagonists whose aid is invaluable are hidden behind the immeasurable technological means that the energy drink brand has put into its participation in the racing circuit, while no one knows it.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was due to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth the success of 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are “unforeseeable gladiators”
HP will set up 20 own stores within two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its trading partner Pont Reyes.
The company will be the first of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 already existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Ingles.
HP Vice President Helena Herrer said she was an example of a newly rebuilt shop at Barcelona’s Gran Vía, a company owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has set up a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), the store in Barcelona is therefore the third.
Herrer did not want to tell where other stores would be opened, however, she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company ranks here with the exclusive design of shop equipment (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of personnel for shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be a franchise and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to “improve customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, operating, after-sales service and even packaging”
The Barcelona store is part of the world-class pilot pioneering program, which aims to solve any problems with computer devices in the warranty.
Online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So we’ll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes that may otherwise last up to two days.”
“This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contractual technical assistance,” said Helena Herrer.
Sabadell says it will steal millions of clients within three years.
More optimistic than other chiefs, a delegated board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
However, it is expected to reduce interest rates, but they will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to win a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to take advantage of the next three years and thus survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect for three years.
The aim is, in addition to survival without having to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by subscribing a million new private clients - or 700,000, if those who eventually leave the bank - as until now, the Institute has rather hurled small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than small clients.
This year, the bank acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it can also be said soberness, in order to reduce the cost, whose challenges the bank will show when it will present the results in the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell closed its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Clients who leave savings will be their main target group.
At a meeting held by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be \"heavy and very important\" -
Indeed, he believes that the path from the crisis in Spain will be lengthy.
In addition, it will be very difficult to create employment in two or three years, which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector.
And although he believes that a passive war - which reduces margins - is ceasing, the price of premiums for the risk that banks and savings pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus offset by the reduction of margins.
The liquidity and financing team is structural and will be a credit pressure factor.
“We haven’t closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDias of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking - the current is a reduction in commissions - but there is a \"competitive framework\"
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not in vain to ensure that in Spain, they will demand greater size.
“The next year there will be no stone on the stone,” he said.
It confirms that the needs of capital are “deservedly reduced” and does not exclude some Spanish institutions from entering red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can supplement the market by collecting funds before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it continues to pose a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but, unlike what was in June, short-term financing can be obtained by repo rates, which reduces the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of fusion savings
CECA’s CEO declined yesterday that another wave of mergers should be created, and once again insisted on the speed at which the sector’s reorganization is carried out.
When he started the process of pooling Spanish savings, there were several institutions that assured that he would not take part in this first stage and wait for the second round.
However, Spanish Confederate General José Antonio Olavarriet ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
“I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívice group cannot be considered the second round, what happens are conventions.”
“Most are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which worked very well on this matter,” the director said.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Aragon’s Association of Leaders and Executive Officers) Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is carried out “at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as it shows in installments that, not now, have appeared in business plans with the Spanish National Bank.”
“The transition from 45 savings with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus in accordance with the Basel Treaty.”
Olavarrieta acknowledged that “there are a number of unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process, which show that there is a lack of reputableness and understanding, because what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us of having to be on the deadline before the end of the year.”
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and, most likely, in the world, and those who question it, have attributed a lack of knowledge.
The Director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, we can be calm about financial institutions and also the system that has mastered - very important - the process of concentration and which continues - at the highest possible speed -
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very well based on the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, through regulation of private intermediation agencies, or the abolition of EUR 426 for unemployed, to the privatization of 49% of AENA (Spain’s airports and air traffic management), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, joined the critics at Chancellor Angela Merkel's address due to her responsibility for the start of the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
In advance, Merkel’s opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what his future should be like, which clashes with the idea of complying with the old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, part of which would be Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to March - although it may now appear as a scifi, this version has a wide support to the public, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to redefine the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigour, fines for the guilty states, possible delays of payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no space for the dials now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission incited deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of its sleeves a constitutional reform to prevent them from doing so from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany thought was right (the plans of fiscal rigour and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by the Central European country, when Merkel was painfully stretching the decision to save Greece.
It was already subject to harsh criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to Greece's rescue.
Finally, on the last days of October, Merkel re-emerged with a clear opinion when she demanded that the European Union be reformed so that it would be possible to save a Member State and, at the same time, that creditors would be obliged to bear some of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved, and over the coming months we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has a red line that it is not going to cross.
And he tells us all that, although there is now a need to take measures with which he seems to disagree too much, the old functioning of the euro will end from that date.
2013 will be the birth of a new monetary zone, in which states violating the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report a delay in payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must give ourselves a strict path of growth with an increase in savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments ruled by the Spanish boom of growth, is simply not intended to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulents will change more calmly.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities they give us until spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statements (reforms promised after meeting big businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) make it clear that despite criticisms about Merkel's address, the way of the idea that things should be put in order.
However, the red line that Germany has set is here, and it does not seem like he wants to move with it.
And the possibilities that can be considered cannot be excluded from leaving the euro area full of overly serious countries.
Germany will always be able to tell us that we have been warned.
Sport and bypassing rules
Finty, as Alonso and Ramos demonstrated in their fight with Ajax, shows the trick not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of the two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alons and Sergio Ramose) in the Champions League against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea ink to be written about whether this is or not an unsportable behavior, and whether UEFA should eventually punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won) the named players one by one deliberately lost their time when the fals were to be played to provoke the sudi, and he showed them the other yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end up in its group at the forefront - and will be able to, free the cards, continue to the next stage.
Finally, UEFA’s Disciplinary Commission gave coach José Mourinho a penalty for two matches and guilty players were fined.
The provocation of a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, that is, the rules that are not written, but follow.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was a Real Madrid team (who in his anthem boasts generosity and honor, and who already fined his player for similar actions), and, it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinhem, who thus adds another episode to his long history of the comedyist and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a circumventation of law in these acts; it is indeed an action respecting the rules of sport, whose sense, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is solved what type of damage such action works to the sports spirit.
One of the elements of sports behaviour is the physical inviolability of the opponents, which has not been violated in these cases, or has not been violently played.
Another of these features characterizing a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage to the team of the opponent - which did not happen here either.
Thus, paradoxical of the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that there has not been what we normally characterize as a fraud or circumventation of law, there has been no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as apparent as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited and they liked the punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage the guilty of their intentional offense will have.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that there is no benefit in the current match, since the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage is that players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by this action, the players will be punished, and they will switch to the second round of cards, in which one card is enough to be excluded less than in the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be clear if this is an advantage.
In short and well, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making a strategic decision that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the case we deal with here, players did not aim to avoid the award of punishment (which would be a clear case of bypassing the rules), but rather to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although there is no clear line between understanding and bypassing the rules, I believe that in this case, it was clearly an ingenuity.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusion and because of the way in which the instructions were passed to provoke them from leadership.
Damage to sports principles with these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The Dictate of the calendar focuses this year on the Lavin reservation on 16 and 17 December.
There is a rapid increase in the celebrations of employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, the arrival of December comes again pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis resulted in a fight to get clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, the questions of entrepreneurs and associations from the sector agree.
In order to complete the complication of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas Eve came on Friday) the application for a week from 13 December, creating anavine of reservations for days at the top (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lost years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave the tradition, many employees pay for the expenses at parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the portability limit, according to the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restaurantió de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
At the moment, the representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be.
“People will think well before they make a reservation.”
“They want to go out, but when it comes to the subject of prices, they are careful,” he adds.
Shops will go well to “who will offer quality and good service at a favorable price”, he says and reminds that due to the crisis, customers tend to go a step down and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey in various facilities shows that the biggest impact of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom of reservations for this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, adapting the offered menus, whose total prices are between 25 and 30 euros.
In another important company, which is Andilana, reading 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year's calendar has brought more early reservations since the beginning of November.
“We have also made it impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The sources of this society emphasize that also on 18 December will be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as compared to last year, they had a tendency to spend 10% more in exchange for additional items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - překl.).
They also noted that companies are already appearing, which invite their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Vice-President Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Free Time Centers in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has “revived” - although clients-to the maximum -
This impression, even during Christmas celebrations, did not give up, let the payer point out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country.
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that the Pakistani nuclear program is inciting in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details that they offer regarding the content of communications and ideas of North American diplomacy representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, is on the rise - and that this unstable Asian country produces - more nuclear weapons than any other state -
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that his weapons are not assembled, but are stored in pieces to make their destruction more difficult in the event of an attack - is one of Washington's main reasons of watchfulness.
This is the calculated ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before the visit of James Jones’ National Security Advisor: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the program of controlled missiles is no longer only observed by the United States, but also by Russia, as a spreading and representing reason to be alert.
“Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or missile-controlled programs,” said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with his counterparts from the US.
The biggest news from Julian Assange’s documentation is increasingly lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the topics of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
A message issued by the embassy in May that qualifys for communication with Pakistan as 'frustrating' states: 'Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected'
In a further report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence worker for South Asia, notes that, despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world.
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to “explain very well” during a visit to General Ashfaq Kayani’s military chief, that the Pakistani army must end silently supporting terrorist groups.
Hon at Wikileaks
Obama calls on a high-ranking counter-terrorism worker to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a red challenge to track and determine where Assange could be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday a “extraordinary challenge” called red notes, to “localize and track movement” Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest order.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates back to 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse facing the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks attorney Mark Stephens assures that “police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang”
It was November 20 when the International Police Corps, based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries of Interpol have guidelines for the identification or localization of Assange, with the aim of maintaining and issuing temporary links to it.
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notices to allow arrests to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national file of the police - especially if the states have a bilateral agreement on the extradition of detainees, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange should appear to be.
Assenge’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday, claimed that Wikileaks’ nine-year-old founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities using videoconferencing.
They also point out that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentij Pavlovich Berija, head of Stalin’s security.
“This is a hunt, not a legitimate persecution,” the letter said.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to Time, the editor-in-chief of the time magazine, via Skype, in an unknown location - in this interview, he requested the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that it was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage in the United Nations and violate the international conventions signed by the United States, it should resign,” he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demission as ‘a ridiculous and absurd’.
“I’m not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual that operates the website,” he said.
Obama himself entrusted a high-ranking anti-terrorist worker, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding Assangem to the importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators declare these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will chair the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations so that anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance can be hit and prosecuted.
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser, said Assange should “be killed”, which he subsequently had to appeal.
Obama should give him a reward or use an unmanned plane or something like that.
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former Arkansas governor and a possible candidate for president.
“Whoever is in the government, he who is responsible for the leak of information, has committed betrayals and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” Fox said.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC - gnashing - on Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its survival.
Huguet proposes a more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós has probably found a recipe to fight the ERC (Levice Republican Party of Catalonia), a no-deal for the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding the demission appears to supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carodo-Rovira insufficient, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader himself, and that he can absolutely not make him as worried as he had with other lost currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms with the help of mutilation, which will help him to armor himself into the municipal elections.
Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the nationwide committee will be able to secretly speak for his continued post.
Use voting tickets, not lifting your hand.
If the followers of Caroda want to give the chairman a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the split and subjugation of his person.
In several interviews, he argued that he would not be considered to be confirmed with half of the votes and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentage that he would not be a good result - in Bulgarian -
Carodo’s supporters demand more from the president than they want to make their function available, which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercós controls the largest body at the conventions.
But since they don’t have enough to enforce demise, they will try to resembrate the plan from now until May.
To this end, they expect to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document, which will allow the leadership to vote on the national council on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to move Congress in autumn 2011.
ERC’s leader said that “much-hungry” is damaging stability, and that its goal is that once and for all, the organization will be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it appears to be a hallmark article, which the current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Having taken into account Puigcercós’ ideology, this Innovation Advisor has taken the point that the leader will be confirmed - in exchange for several goals -
And he named them five, two of them.
The first is “recomposing” executions to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces that are inclined from the Carod sector.
The second goal can be a great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely end the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it is fighting for the reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held through delegates chosen by the vote.
Quitting the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercos's team, which has already fought in this regard at the last two congresses.
However, the 2008 Convulsive Assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special Congress on the Reforms of the Statutes.
This issue is still unsolved, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of the matter.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, it could be a good time to deal with this issue again and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed for November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has seen 4 cases decline compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to Milenio.
Among the murders are cases of three women and finding a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, there are a total of 390 killings in Mexico, probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases is the finding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three fire wounds, a wound from grace to the head, and had hands and feet tied by a rope.
The next day the body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above the streets of Mixtecas, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, co-operatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three deadly chest shots at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body, there was a report signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a fifty-year-old man was killed by eight shots after he left his home and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims at the age of 30 were killed in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in the Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, a man's corpse was found shot in the forehead, and under the body was found ammunition from a gun of a calibre of 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the canal of wastewater in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
The rescue forces carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but they were not found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported finding a body with their hands tied back and their head in place of Pen Colorado.
The man had a firearm wound on his back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda, Atizapán de Zaragoza, was also reported to be threatening death.
A day later, it was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the district of Los Reyes La Paz, a cardboard box containing a human head.
in a nearby colony was found the rest of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
Seventeen were found two dead women wrapped in bed linen in the Zoquiapan settlement in the Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning, a man was found in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue bed, which was preliminarily identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by the killers.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla village without signs of life with two wounds to the back.
On the skin of a woman was discovered the tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally \"Holy Death\") as well as necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man's corpse was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car with at least a third shot wound and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads were found, and there was also a message, in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim’s report was probably one of the criminal organizations in which it stood: ‘This will happen to those who do not adapt.’
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, which carried signs of torture and had tied limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustin Center of Justice.
The last day of the month was found the remains of two men in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezhualcoyotl.
The first of them was stunned and found in the Cuchilla Ancon colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left with a message; while the second was tortured and was found in plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents and the ticket with the message were found.
China keeps track of its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN Climate Change Conference COP16, a representative of the country assured that its country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and said it insists on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% in 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of the country at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this with the international community.
The Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programs.
At all these points, progress has already been made, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
Furthermore, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he said, various multi-year plans have already been completed, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is a programme for the efficient use of energy that has been introduced over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations, government and private initiatives.
There is also a provincial project of climate change, as well as a project of the exchange of fluorescent lamps for economical bulbs and a project of mitigation and adaptation, he specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert climate change advisor, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he described greenhouse gas emissions per capita account for 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share in emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects it to make further progress by 2020.
Espina: César Nava
The National President of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to apply for the National Order Committee of his law.
The National President of the PAN Party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legalized and that the former President of the party was entitled to contact the National Order Committee and demand his rights.
In an interview with the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that Espin’s exclusion was in any case a decision taken at local level.
“This is an autonomous decision of the Council of Sonore”
“Mr Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the National Council’s Board of Directors in order to take decisions made by a competent authority,” he added.
He further explained that now is no time to think about 2012 and that she was never at the negotiating table about the alliance’s presidency.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAS would come out of the internal elections held on the 4th and 5th December, in which his followers would be elected.
“This (the Alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been to the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, that was the intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
He said that 71 years of dialogue were behind him, and that is why “we do not have any internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us” he added.
He said the committee could elect without debate the best president or president it deserves for the next three years, so he would hand over the team to the one he will determine.
“I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, and I will be proud to hand over to each of the five members of the party’s office.”
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the recent July elections would be reflected in future clones, although - it's not yet time to think about 2012 -
“Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task.
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as “many expectations and desires are put into them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet these expectations.”
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI party (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party)) because of his speeches within four years, César Nava called on members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
“If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedilla and Salinase were better than the rule of Fox and Claderon, let them begin to defend them, let them come out of their shells,” he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during his speech in the National Auditor, since neither guru nor censorship is used in this country.
Obama promotes law on Twitter to support students without documents
“If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to pass this law,” the president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
“If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to pass this law,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to an internet link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to immediately connect with senators, as the vote on this law is approaching.
“If the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the moment, let your opinion sound,” he said.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the extension of the tax reduction from the Bush era and government funding was approved.
Such a blockage, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and on other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesperson said he believed that once the fiscal theme has been resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
I believe there is enough time left.
We all agree that we must resolve the issue of taxes before the end of the year.
I believe that we can reach an agreement on this matter at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters,” he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would be calling for a vote on the closing of the debate on the Dream Act, so that the proposal to legalize students without documents could vote in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is more likely to be next week.
The Senate approval of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize about 800,000 young people who have reached the United States before the age of 16, reside in the country during the last five years, and have been admitted to the institution of higher education or the military.
However, the supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organization of its supporters carry out intense campaigning to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, most of whom the Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters negotiate the most are Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have previously supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but have said they will no longer support it.
Another Republican, who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives adheres to a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with the literature they put their finger in the wound -poner el dedo en la llaga - translated - insert the finger into the wound - is similar to Czech - to strike the nail on the head - znan.
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of the language was a promenade where the participants presented the literary gala performances
“I understand this with Sex in my language, but... A finger in the wound? What is expected of me?” asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of pleasure in the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair they devoted themselves to the topic of Sex in the language at a round table, she explained).
“The finger brings us to the narrow,” said Argentinian writer to the audience, mainly composed of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to listen to this debate at a round table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramíreze, Mayra Montera and Luise García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she dedicated to Gonzala Celorio, and which Schultz then described as a great story, in which Luisa performed in the first person as a protagonist, who, in search of knowledge of what it is - the morning - walks from a doctor to a doctor from whom she does not get an answer although she tracks the same story yes.
The infectologist goes away convinced: “Pastiness is not my strength, it may be my wound.”
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: 'The morning represents it really open and the scar is symbolical -
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that “it was so much to learn about the wound, that it was truly open and that it did not exist,” but it became convinced that pleasure and trapping in the tongue must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also appeared with a charming story, which he called the Glory of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but at one point appears.
With elements of magical realism, she tells of the famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who went far away, or corrected the honor lost by one virgin, this story, which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who told him, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes exaggeration in the storytelling of conquering captains.
“Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the finged testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in another way he never managed to tell the story of America with such imagery that she lacked even a student.”
However, he stressed that “they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination” and precisely where the reality and lie flowing, where it is no longer known what from the story belongs to one group and, in terms of the other, reaches the fictional literature of its peak.
It is called the \"Cervant tradition\"
“Thanks to his message, we have what we have.”
Then Mayra Monter stressed and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair to her speech, the Finger, made possible in the morning.
The Cuban-Portorist writer pointed her finger to the great wound of social violence that passes through her country - and she is shared by Latin America - and is a consequence of trade disputes and drug sales.
“I think good literature, good poetry, and good songs are making a silent compromise that is not intended,” she said after saying that the reality of literature is a communication and a dimension of compromise that is created between the author and the reader, and in their “chemical response”
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed, whose performance also emphasized this finger into the wound of a writer tied to it.
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits, and in the control of consciousness that overflows dogmatisms, one forgets that behind every attraction there is a little no, and behind every denial there is also a little yes.
“To be masters of our thoughts and reality, we have to color: and to dye means to put a finger into the wound many times and to bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed idies and without coloring, and to bother also the authorities that prefer this black and white world,” he said in order to support the sense of writing.
Romano is following her first title.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved three opportunities for a decisive series.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there will also be two different styles characterized by their techniques, teams that have a clear difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finale, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved three occasions in the decisive series, but until now he has left with the unconquered, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
Argentinec had to be satisfied with the silver medal, remained a step behind the winner, and played with the same team the following final.
The Santist strategist, as a coach, entered his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he had in his hands the Morelia club, with which he had a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the 2003 tournament, he again went to the decisive duel and also lost him with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the “Daddy” from Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the “Uzenaries” (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - a.k.a.) after 210 minutes of the game indecisively 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got into the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but eventually his three players passed from 11 steps and the team suffered a turn on 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against “Red Devils” from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
“I want to go out as a winner, I don’t want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I’m committed to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important,” the coach said when asked about the numbers he spoke in the final against him.
In living memory, he has a previous finale in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, ‘we learned that until the referee finishes, we cannot celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were ready to celebrate, and I think we learned this until the match ends, we can’t celebrate.
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: ‘You never try to get to a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you have to be prepared for it, in the past tournament we were ready, but unfortunately the fate has prepared a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we have lost it, it has left something in us, and hopefully this time it will not happen -
Romano has the chance to stop being the other in his hands and taste the first glory that titles bring.
The United States is changing the rules for issuing visas
People will have to contact the Service Centres for visa applicants before they interview at the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the process of discussing visas to the Embassy of the United States and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Service Centres for Visa Applicants (shortly from English ASC) before interviewing the Consular Department.
Staff from the ASC shall collect biometric information from the applicant and they shall be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain benefits, including the following:
The total cost of completing the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a need to pay a fee for the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and another for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee which shall cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount equivalent to $140 for tourist visas, $150 for visa applications (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for business and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa won’t have to interview a consular official, but they will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since biometric information will be collected at ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who will apply for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the service of $26.

NASA announces discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause an evil search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock astrobiology experts, a science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, dissemination and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington.
When she invited reporters, NASA assured her that she would introduce a discovery that would cause a bad search for extraterrestrial life, which triggered speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are, besides us, other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility of becoming intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
It seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemite National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Creation somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this capacity that increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenics in their metabolism, it will be proven that “there is another, a second form of life, different from the one we know.”
The Space Agency will announce the real impact of the discoveries on tomorrow’s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Carmela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explore Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Coverage and Patron produce opposition block
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the coming of “bipartism”, they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period, when the opposition bloc was established in Congress, led by members of the parties of the PRD (Partido de la Revolucion Democratica, Czech - Party of the Democratic Revolution - not to mention.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech - Labour Party - not to mention.), Convergence (Czech -Shoda - etc.) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalva, who declared himself independent, and the four discussed one thing: the arrival of “bipartism” to the House.
Prior to the opening of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from the Convergium, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo - Hrímíli - opposed to the reform of the Constitutional Act, as it decommissions them.
With this reform, they repeated, started “bapartism” because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the PRD’s coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech-National Action Party) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality from the drive of the PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech-Revolutionary Institutional Party) and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will again be subjected to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
“When I came here (the opposition coalition), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, even they are not willing to consider the opinion of others,” he said.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of the Convergence party, said that the PRD, PT and Patron agree and will form a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow, continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be “duopol”
The aspiration of the law reform is not that there is an infinite bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, on the part of the PT, explained that at present Congress has become “corrost”, two - in a hint on the side of the PAN and PRI.
“There was only one side of it before, and today it is divided by two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected to give him a seat at the negotiating table.
“In order that the five Members, who are likely to be nine, but who are now seeing us in five, will not remain outside of the arched agreements, each in another faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed, we stand outside, and we disagree with this reform.”
A further 200,000 pesos are issued to the supplier.
The city hall in Mazda will pay another check of the company’s discussed owner supplying the electromaterial.
A further check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent to the town hall by Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
The amount paid in this second half-year of the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial is increased to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the City Hall’s transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, was issued to 200.144,56 pesos, and as its subject matter was listed as “balance of outstanding payments”
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for sale at a high price, additional consideration.
What was not said is the total amount that still owes it to the town hall, and how many checks will still be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been purchased now, only what we owe to her, as well as other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last cheques appeared again in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government’s letter, as the law states in the case of companies checked by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to avoid the use of their services by other administrative authorities, the cashier has assured that it has not used the services of the City Hall supplier again.
In the earlier days, after July 25, Noroeste published a revision of the checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sáncheze, the city of Camach Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the foreign tourist accident due to the poor state of the Sáncheze Taboad in Mazda.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the deep at Sáncheze Taboad, the tourist sector in Mazda asks the authorities to pay attention to the areas and places that are in bad condition and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zone Dorada Traders Association, said they repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination to be taken care of, and the bad things tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of streets and trails affects tourists who walk here and see mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for one day, and they don’t have an idea of the sales they’re running out of, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to deal with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
“The board will have to take responsibility and avoid repeating something like this, it will have to deal with preventive maintenance, not just repairing existing defects,” he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its maintenance strategy -
There are also other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (a monument, a statue of the deer, etc.).
“Today, in order for tourists to come, it does not matter only the promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city with cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out,” he said.
“There was no need for attention, and these facts highlight something that is well-known to everyone, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said the priority must be to keep the city clean and well in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazda is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazdalan offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, which will need to be put in order first to make these places more attractive and to be able to put them on the list we have to promote this destination.
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Davalos, president of the CCE, would like the MPs to take great responsibility by following an example in the search for a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State executive requires the business sector in Mahatlan, because Sinaloa is confused in turbulents and faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from Partido Nueva Allianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence and the last from the PVEM, includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to carry out decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not repeat.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on great responsibility and lead by example on the way to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary bridge to move the ruling forward in order.
“We want them to do a decent job and be primarily committed to society and sectors, because they were the people of Sinaloy who gave them confidence in their past elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces to achieve the country’s economic growth, as the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is that they encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage the creation of jobs in some way.
As regards tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
“I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currencies and investments, which in addition directly competes with agriculture.”
In addition, in order to spend resources on starting-up tourist projects, Congress should help provide the state with certainty and assistance with the alcohol law that failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Three Kings are sought.
Dolls, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the list of wishes of children in the Coronad Valenzuel family.
For their parents, the upcoming feast of the Three Kings will be difficult to fulfill their ideas, as their household is numbering exactly 12 people and one lamb.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will share the toys and clothes they desire so much.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father does not have a permanent job.
“Sometimes it’s hard because the husband isn’t lucky, but we’re selling mandarins and potatoes...I’m going out in the afternoon with the “dwellers” on the street selling on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, the mother of children.
A four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Barbie.
As for the ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would have wanted to wear one-year-size clothes.
“He told me (José Alfredo) ‘I would like this monster car’, but I told him ‘we’ll see his son’ because it was very expensive,’ he remembers Cayetan’s sadness.
For older children who were just at school, it would be ideal clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11-year-old, is 12, 10-year-old Isaías, while 8-year-old Miguel wears size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he'd be too good to have a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign - Three Kings are looking for - and at the reception of the Noroeste daily to bring a gift or money in cash.
14 drug traffickers who were arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estonia, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced with various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford, and in Stok, mainly in places that were used to manufacture drugs.
“Around 750 flower beds of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that was used to produce were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesperson for the police in Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom supposed bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrests had to arrive at the Sherbrook Judicial Palace following their arrest.
They could face allegations of Indian cannabis production, its possession with the aim of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections took place after a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
“It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests,” said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional unit of investigation of the city of Estria State Police of Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will continue without any problems.
The draft law of conservatives, which according to the government should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will clearly be overwhelmed while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
Significantly, I base myself on the Charter.
“I stand right on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet,” liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, surrounded by MPs after a weekly session of du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow anyone from a ship to be detained for up to one year, identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc, Gilles Ducempte, also said he could not support the bill because it was moving towards a bad goal.
“We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will see what the government will do,” Ducempte said.
Critics of the NPD on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“Neo-democrats agree to take action against illegal immigrants’ smugglers, and that is what we consider to be a supporting part of another bill, C-35,” said Chow.
“We do not support the draft law of conservatives because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year,” said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties.
“Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that they take on the fly and treat Canada as some patholistics.”
“They expect Canada to take consistent action,” Kenney said.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative said to the QMI Agency that the government would demand a vote so that every member who opposes will respond from his position before his or her voters.
A new unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public investigation commission on the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives to prevent this idea from falling into oblivion: Quebec intends to consult with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That’s why Tuesday’s announcement surprised some of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
There was no further need for a public security critic, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as a “king drawn out of a hat” and an “amateur solution on the knees”
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
“He’ll be satisfied with the confirmation: you’ll see the result when we announce it.”
We are aware of this problem -
For the President of CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing in a public check-up.
“In addition, Mr. Charest affirms that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he hides something,” he explains.
“The only means to achieve the creation of an investigation committee is Jean Charest’s demission,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Public Officials.
In order to come out of this dead end, he proposed Quebec to grant a special mandate to the Inspector General in order to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Inspector,” he said.
He also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioner to force people to testify.
Creating a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Charest government.
Quebec would also after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code to better adapt it to this type of crime.
This request would be based on the mandate for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed Justice Minister Jean- Marc Fournier that the case-law of this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments linked to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected a group of bikers, although the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa then made changes to the Gangstering Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water streams have come under strict control due to severe precipitations that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is curved.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit heavy precipitation, i.e. rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 additional millimetres were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
Sections in the north of the river and the Outaouais valley were most affected.
A total of 100 millimetres could fall there.
If we add these precipitations to the snowfall accumulated in some sectors, we can worry about flooding in some waterflows.
On Wednesday evening, Quebec’s rescue service announced a warning of flood hazards for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jerôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, severe precipitation in the distribution of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte- Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
As a result of heavy rains, one temporary bridge was destroyed in Saint-Calixte.
Two residences had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, the discharge of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency and oversees the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec flood forecasting center has issued a warning on Wednesday of strong floods for several rivers, particularly Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont
Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards (RRTV) due to controversial statements concerning social aid and Haitians and, as well as due to gross expression during broadcasting.
The Council for Radio and Television considers that Mr Dupont and his group at CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained “inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative representations of the Haitians of gross expression which did not correspond to the broadcast broadcast during the day”
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the transmission of the name of the two people who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Council for Radio and Television received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the Commission's members concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcasts of the ‘Dupon’s midday reports have come across a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner.
No statement was raised against him.
The last dispute was about the statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were thus in a media shootout that triggered many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he didn’t send any gift to help Haitians because we can’t be sure they’ll get the money they need.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unwarranted, but that their cumulative effect created an inappropriately negative picture of the Haitians.
“I have already made my three-day postponement of this thing.”
“My file has been intact for one and a half years,” the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression on broadcasting.
In any event, radio broadcasts of COPI-FM cooperated - beyond their responsibilities -
For stations that will have to notify, inter alia, this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuvà Montreal.
Montreal's resident, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special course.
An athlete who excels in “sand” (Kung-fu-full contact), kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the world’s dads and rings and seeks new challenges.
“I started with martial arts like kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for matches a little everywhere, because for those who don’t like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this person, who works as a security guard and as an assistant to UPS, has just delivered bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Karate and Kickboxing Championship (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won the full contact and Thai box categories,” he said.
“I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in san shou”
“They were invited by rivals who finished with the first four at the last World Cup in each category.”
“In Toronto in 2009 I won bronze.”
In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth.
“In 2007 in China I finished in the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third,” he added.
Interestingly, I have made some progress in every competition.
This year I will be the first or last year.
-san shou - or -sanda - is a discipline originating in China, where fist and foot strikes, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
The matches take place traditionally on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of struggle, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the supertournay, King of Sanda, Super Bowl in the kung fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” explains a nice guy.
It is somewhat equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand).
It was a great experience -
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered a loss in the final.
“He who defeated me was a true professional, analyzed”
There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
The semi-finals will be held in the finals of their category.
“Then the winners of each category will compete to be crowned a single champion, the king of kung-fu”
450 million contracts without public competitions
Hydro-Québec agreed to co-opt 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this lavage of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project of $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, named Énergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this significant $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium-Énergie gérance acquired a lucrative contract without any public announcement of the competition.
For the Quebecan party, a complaint against a consortium of companies puts us in a serious ethical issue that risks excluding competition and raises prices.
“It’s a new way to carry out a collision and eliminate competition.”
“This means that people, no longer doing side-by-side agreements, are already doing them openly today,” said PQ Member Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he said it was hard to bear how public interest could be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said this afternoon, strongly denying that this would be a collusion contract.
“I have my own way,” she said, saying that PQ was ‘unfair,’ and that it lacked accuracy.
She said, “That would be the least,” that she would apologize to PQ.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, allowing two or more companies to group their mutual experts to respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the breadth of work.
The building is already running and must be layoutd by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of the consortiums is no longer an exception in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortiums in engineering consulting is under investigation in the government.
If we fly through the speed of the trade register of thequebet companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let’s name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As for the consortium of Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau stressed, in particular, that the \"territory of La Baie James\" is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s.
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Society Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that would force us to smother over the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
If you go to a public competition and if there are few participants to the tender, your bids may be higher.
“You have two options to choose from: i.e., that you are gathering people who are in that contract as participants of the competition, and that you will say, ‘Let’s make an agreement satisfactory and with a good price,’” he said.
“But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of people,” Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium of Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verifying Le Devoir counted 109 consulting contracts in the engineering industry, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories conducting soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in the ‘Énergie gérance’.
All contracts were concluded.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are a very good known Liberal Party of Quebec.
Minister Normandeau has released a report that PQ is also associated with companies that “fund it” before clarifying that they are more of her managers.
The barometer responsible for consumption - 'green - etiquette does not raise confidence
More green but openly skeptical.
The Quebecian consumer has little confidence in sustainable development, but also in “unbiased” brands and environmental certificates, to be guided by the choice of products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy in a media universe that urges us to be more socially responsible for consumption, the media universe complains about the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil obligations that it even qualifys for its commitment, Baromètre says responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although in 2010 consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased, the residents of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, still do not believe them too much.
Two-thirds of us in fact say they don’t believe in environmental promises simply because green advertising companies are finding a measuring tool developed by the University of Sherbrook’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands, which are referred to as eco-responsible, says Barometers.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as a serious 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information about responsible consumption seems to be the first priority for stimulating this page of consumption, which is currently almost a third of thequebean consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, at a higher price for these products.
After all, a third of the people of Quebekusa are distrustful of the product or ‘green’ data we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping with merchants from their neighborhood and gave preference to buying food grown in their region, says Baromètre.
The responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year, Homo consumus Québeku likes to present himself as the king of recycling, which seeks as little environmental impact as possible by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological consciences apparently remained outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, nearly 28% of Quebec’s population said they were using public transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and cycling also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive survey of behaviour who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris of the company Angus et le Parallelèle, agrees to participate, but only to the amount of the loan.
The Developper company Angus et le Parallelèle, which sought a $7 million gift from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematic complex on the Saint-Laurenta boulevard and who demonstrated her mission as a cinematic art lover, did not obtain what she demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than proposing a loan to the government of Quebec, the amount of which would have been lower, there was some original expectation that could have laid the foundation for viable solutions under favorable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan were sent by Minister St-Pierre to the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallelèle et Venus has until December 31st to answer.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centers in Quebec was opposed to the state's direct investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the other hand, several participants in the discussion were asked for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got to the premises of his cinemas within a decade of film art after he himself funded the construction of the complex, which could have been a reason for the revision by the State’s financial board.
The lack of halls for independent films is screaming in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallelèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is campaigning to release funds into the private sector, believing it will spend $700,000 to push out the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Parallelèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and screen the most beautiful film of the film, Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir, and so he ignores himself, thinking with his group about the downsizing proposals made to him.
The raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic U.S. sources reported through WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians towards Americans, but by the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voters are at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote, and they believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, among which were the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, last night’s public edit, provide sensitive details to get into each other’s skin.
Communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the electoral campaign, details at which point the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides a few explanations to this situation.
“The Canadian complex of inferiority, almost obscuring, makes it possible for political leaders to talk about internal bets instead of realizing that these elections apply to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
“The United States is, therefore, “a proverbial elephant in these elections: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about them.”
The ambassador understands this ‘noble silence’, less so that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better head of the party to lead these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections.”
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s preservation in voting for confidence at the beginning of February regarding the federal budget that Canada will publicly grant its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a 30 to 40 billion-dollar renewal plan,” says M. Breese.
There is nowhere to mention that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of Parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties condition their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, alerts Washington to an increasingly negative picture cast on the United States by the drama series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which it is possible to observe not very clever references to the Maher Arar, ‘No-Fly-List’, or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent investigations at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guantánam prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the principle - the case from the case -
At the end of the meeting, he writes here, “he sold some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret.”
The Secretary accepted that the file would be revised.
Finally, the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweaty.
Tom Flanagan, a former counsellor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “destroyed.”
Mike Huckabee in the United States also heard about it.
World Lighting Recovery Plan
The United Nations has proposed a plan in Cancún to restore home lighting, lighting stores and industrial spaces in 100 countries to achieve a GES reduction, which corresponds to nearly one-third of the further constraints to be achieved to stabilize the climate of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the United Nations wants to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implementable reduction commitments on the part of industrialised countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the light bulbs that monopolize 50 to 70 percent of the market replace fluocompact bulbs or, even better, the bulbs with electroluminescent LEDs (DEL or -LED - in English), the essential amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet formed due to lighting would be degraded.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world’s emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow a decrease in global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to be deducted from this balance of 5 Gts to achieve the stabilization of climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to avoid being out of control.
In hot bulbs, 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs with DEL, we reduce this consumption by twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new light bulbs with DEL, such as the one that put into production this week Philips - this company was reportedly involved in a UN study - have an estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of possible savings with a refund plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new light bulbs can also work with reostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up collectors.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact bulb, but rather a heat-fired coal power plant that releases many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centres put into circulation 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year for buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 equivalent to 3.5 heat plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly expects the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadline has expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and to immediately announce the preliminary results,” the UN president said.
Calls on all parties in Côte d’Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are notified.
Despite the pressures from some foreign governments, the electoral commission left the earliest date - Wednesday midnight - without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's screw.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, CEI president confirmed on television that the Commission was “continuing to work” in order to report the results.
On Wednesday, there have been many calls worldwide for CEI to finally declare the name of the second round winner, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But Gbagbo's camp relies on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for the \"fraud\" vote in the north, which was administered by former New Army rebels (FN) since the failed state coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential electoral campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the maneuvers of the intimidation of voters practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged the supporters of the President of Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
Elections could be revoked if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s supreme court is not neutral because it is governed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demented any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of the results as \"unacceptable\" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, because he knows he has suffered loss, and that filing a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he defended the electoral commission from sending out the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was considered a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided into two-half for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the political faction of Côte d’Ivoire that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round on October 31, as a winner with 38% votes versus 32% for Alassana Ouattara, who won public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional data with seasonal deviation corrections (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stood at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, unemployment rates increase by 0.1 points.
In a broader picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they are looking for or not.
The situation of current young people in the labour market has increased further with a new increase in unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, there were 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24, in the sense of the words of the International Labour Office.
As far as seniors are concerned, they have seen a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population recorded the benefit of unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a polemic about its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to draw up monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday the rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandra Guérini is charged and put in custody
Alexandra Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and brother of PS, Bouches-du-Rhône Management Board, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in an investigation into public procurement, allegedly submissively obtained.
Alexander Guérini was accused of misuse of the company's assets, abuse of public funds and public property, concealment, provision of bribery, acceptance of bribery in order to influence the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
“Alexandre Guérini is wary and insists that the judge explain all the questions he intends to ask him, not any misconceptions.”
“It’s easy to pursue it because of many punitive kissings, but another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but to ensure the landfills he was supposed to manage.
With regard to the award of contracts or the destination of the funds associated with their operation, he never knew of such a thing, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former general manager of Aubagne agglomeration services, was charged on Wednesday for the misuse of public funds and compote, and left the whole case under judicial supervision, with a ban on dealing with the protagonists.
“My client was able to explain to him all the facts he was concerned with,”
“The investigating judge looks at it and leaves it at liberty,” said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Another four people were charged and released on Tuesday to Wednesday, with being under judicial supervision because of two of them.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is prosecuted for accepting bribery in order to influence the Office and for passive corruption.
Two Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier agglomerers are accused, one for the theft and abuse of the company’s assets, the other for the “compulsion of public funds”
Finally, Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of “secreting the abuse of the company’s assets”
Among those who have been confronted with Mr Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in the parallel case of fraudulent public contracts concerning Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to clean up money from a large gangstery.
The investigation is conducted under several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the case of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search is mainly focused on the conditions for the assignment and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Abubagne, as well as from some of the cities of the city community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Case: Elysian Palace Exaggerates Mediation of Syria
Over the course of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the award of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran due to ‘spying’, united views in France, brought diplomacy into combat alert and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this has been closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents, obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, and went so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian imprisoned in France, and a sought-after U.S. justice for subhuman material trafficking in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they submit to the sharp light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The Diplomatic Telegram, written on 12 August 2009 in Paris, has a title: “Iran:French comments on how to solve in the case of hostages”
A consultant from the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa, the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. Diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They recommend that Americans do the same to be transported back to their own country by violence held in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously express, in the media, “the fundamental rights of man,” “innocentness,” “immediate liberation.”
It is necessary to bring into the difficult Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it more, the more they ask you to stop doing it.”
Since there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, nothing will be solved by them - the Iranians are \"masters on evasive maneuvers\"
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is an “Iran family tactic: taking hostages for “political blackmail” purposes.
It announces that Klotilda Reiss' liberation (which will take place on August 16, on the day the French embassy gives her refuge) - will require the payment of a high amount of money to Iranians - (causing €230,000).
And he will announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that will “focus out”
In the future, Iranians could arrest some 1,800 other French people living in Iran, he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Iran's Majid Kakavand, which the United States claims to have been expelled for illicit e-commerce sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
As many observers, the U.S. Embassy is asking about this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which pursues an illegal Iranian network to obtain material for a nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France join the treaty?
Liberation of the Iranians for the Liberation of the Young French?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he said, was not only “surprisingly surprised by this decision by the judge” but was looking for an opportunity to oppose it.
“There have been talks between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but the French government cannot change the court’s decision,” he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée Palace Advisor dials a phone number, hangs a phone earphone and then informs an American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Paris buildings administered by the Iranian Embassy.
At the time of Klotilda Reiss’ imprisonment in Iran, the Elysian Palace is negotiating, through communication and organized escapes, into the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a “significant” and “influenced” role of mediator.
Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that manipulation bears its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The Telegram of August 25, 2009 provokes the media-light of French official officials.
What is based on such a degree of gratitude, expressed to M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their declaration of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
“Intensive communication is aimed at validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up Syria,” he said.
The policy applied in 2008 was observed by many critical voices both in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved.
By exaggerating the Syrian role, Paris is trying to “demonstrate Syria,” which glories can serve when it plays a constructive role in the area.
The aim is also to \"salt grains between Syria and Iran.\"
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: \"Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is -
\"But yet we thanked them -
“This should at least bring confusion and confusion among the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysee Palace.
He thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their active role in the liberation of our countrywoman.
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called “Pacivalian”, which will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under the age of 16, said representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
“Many children play these games all night and then have problems learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day.”
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the head of the ministry, said in a statement.
Online games will be available from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit their daily access to these games for youngsters, whose parents ask for it, to be supplemented by a responsible worker.
It will also make available to people who ask for it free of charge, allowing them to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “sponsored” countries, and the daily press regularly brings about various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa sets up host countries.
Full unrest due to the suspicion of corruption is established by the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday of the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, the selection of top-ranked politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risks overcoming technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the FIFA Royal Competition in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to set in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that will take part in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, Head of Government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
Negotiations behind the scenes are at risk of taking up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to candidates.
According to the Fifa Assessment Report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contains the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Commission at the hour intended for voting.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of their country, the doves kicked, which so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
On Monday, the BBC put a crown on it when it aired a document that “stretched on the pin” three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and bring the English leader to trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that his predecessors have succeeded in serving as Tony Blair, who was able to win the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its CE name (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal do not miss the trumps of the already prepared stadiums, its well-being (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared \"unfair competition in the preparation of the vote\" in verbal hints barely distorted on charges of the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
“We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them,” Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favorite with its considerable experience in 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, seems to have a great lead in front of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidacys seem to be premature for both countries, which, together in 2002, passed the ‘test’.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which FIFA hotly wishes, has made Asian chances invalid for 2022.
With Qatar, which pulled a large ace out of its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for chatty TV charges (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand seemed to be hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate even in the smallest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The Mandate of the Elysee Palace is calling someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret associated with the presiding function.
It is therefore necessary to make it as if doubts persisted.
In both sense and in the other sense.
In 2006, without a desire to believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac made claims that the third mandate would not be excluded.
On November 15, with the serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would “decid sometime in the autumn of 2011”
As he reminds the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the perspective of “two mandates” has again given rise to a little fever.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far away.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year term of office to two.
It was just a statement, not a statement.
It is not the first time that he remembers the humorous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
“In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years ahead of you,” he said in July 2009.
May 2010 Rebel: “Don’t think I’m not thinking about the next stage.”
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it is because of the double truth.
Accelerate the way to the candidacy to the PS, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to Ségolèna Royala, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, its 2012 candidacy is evident that many in the PS want to organize into combat teams rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the François Fillon candidacy over Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with UMP,” the president responded immediately and cautiously.
“If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will still believe he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, leveled with clarity.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year should have been an opportunity to specify the conditions for the outcome of the crisis or, at least, a notification of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European claims is committed, and the Securities Institute will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of deterioration of the situation already so tense in European securities markets.
In this case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in order to address the crisis of European debt.
She did not want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing their program of buying sovereign bonds.
“I am paying my attention to my European partners. . . . .
In the evening before that, in Brussels, in its hearing with the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and satisfied that he stated that the program of buying state titles on the secondary market was \"continuing\" and that \"we will see how we will decide\" during the session that takes place this Thursday.
The European Central Bank will monitor its basic interest rate of 1%, historically the lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds from the Central European Bank’s cashier have doubled to nearly €1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unwiseness of the market, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the anti-cipation market partners about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Neither do economists expect any significant change in the course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank’s arsenal, the latter bank shall approach the unlimited provision of liquid assets under generous conditions and for a duration from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
I can’t imagine changing my program in a significant way.
“If not, it would mean accepting the risk of a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, Commerzbank’s economist.
“The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
“The European Central Bank would have to maintain the purchase volume of its bonds in order to revive the poor market,” says Norbert Bräms.
In view of the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no other choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the inflammation of paid performances by States, among the most fragile, testified yesterday by a significant bond manager.
Because if interest rates fly, states will be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the alarming situation relaxed a little, yesterday with a backflow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economics, the presidents said they had heard Giulia Tremonti qualifying for the situation as “unsolvable” and that he was expecting a “unpredictable” weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basic points and the price of the bankruptcy-risk contracts (CDS) dropped to 263 points, causing some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said of himself that he was “too busy” by “the turbulent development of the markets” and a possible disease from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.
“The bad news is that it is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clear and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and non-obvious fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’s latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 . . . . whereas the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission will calculate the government deficit of 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (compared to 3.9% of the expected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
From here, a new summary of the state budget proposals that could be introduced after the holidays amounting to €7 billion.
“If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken,” said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
“The cornerstones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Board of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product of 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise is less than the efforts required from other countries,” notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE’s chief economist.
There is a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal to distrust the House of Deputies, and then the elections that are expected to be held at the end of March could begin.
This would start a period of time, not suitable for taking a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde once again stressed this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: “I think Europeans have demonstrated it on Sundays throughout the day and night, apparently very solid, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.”
Although everything is relative, yesterday's expansion regarding interest on European state bonds, it brought water to the mills of governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, the target for which various speculations focus the most.
“Because in May, there is a lack of transparency and obvious policy, particularly on banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas.
More importantly, “political time is running slower than market time”
Conscious of this interrupted connection and the danger that it hides, European countries are intensifying the discussion towards strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
In view of Eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is taking place today.
The programme includes the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Finance Fund (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, denied a trip to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of this path is not to increase funds, it prepares the ground to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, the US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries concerned, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join strict action with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid used a different way than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their lasting trust.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that 750 billion euros would not be enough mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to re-reach the stockpile of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the player of the very first plan of trade in European sovereign claims, believe that an addition of about €100 billion would be enough, “more likely, by providing direct financial liquidity.
The fund exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is donated to this day by 60 billion euros.
The Council, which has all the chances of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are getting worse.
Snow and snow: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations still create traffic difficulties, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some of the economic activities.
Twenty-four districts have an orange alert from now on due to the risk of snow and snow.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that already have the declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later at night.
According to Méteo France, significant snowfalls are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and the forest of Charentes and snowfalls in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin districts are included.
Snow tides are large enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, says Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and police recommend driving with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks was cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
No special measures are foreseen on Wednesday evening to limit freight traffic.
District Office - calls on all car drivers to be as cautious as possible on the roads as possible and to adapt the nature of the road -
The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to the expected snowfalls.
DGAC advises passengers using air transport services to connect with their company.
Gatwick Airport in South London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed in the UK until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we commemorate 23 billion to the metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable this building to be launched, the State announced a grant of €4 billion.
The only theoretically, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source to the contract.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Rectification Act, which examines the National Assembly’s financial committee this morning, contains mechanisms to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and raising an office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is “for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris”
It is calculated: ‘The yield from this interest is EUR 117 million per year’.
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists so that it is upgraded to increase its yield and that this increase affects Société du Grand Paris.
How much would it cost?
It's too busy.
This is not calculated in the text.
Within 4 billion we are far away.
It is specified that these fiscal resources join €4 billion in capital subsidies that will be mobilised by the state and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project - we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
“From the moment we created income (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then dig into 4 billion,” he explains.
It will be integrated into the budget and used as needed.
SGP believes that 4 billion will only be credited in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which 4 billions of promises belong to yet absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7th.
Vulnerable Hackers and Prohibitive Investigators
The WikiLeaks case has a dual meaning.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be only a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it talks about deep changes at international level, and predicts a future controlled by regression.
But let's do the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of print cuts.
“The extraordinary revelation of Americans about the way Berlusconi’s sexual life is to say what everyone could have read in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi own), and the nebula caricature profile of Kadafí has long been a subject for cabaret artists for jumps.
The rule, according to which secret documents can consist only of messages already known, is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Zednářich) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like searching for new information (and does not know where to look for reports about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informer is lazy, and a lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, an editor in the Liberation newspaper), who considers it true only what he himself admits.
Information with high secrecy about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department, was the same information Newsweek published a week earlier.
So why has so much habit been made around the revelation of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated man already knows, namely, that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can make phone calls or fly by plane to a common dinner, has lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into espionage centers.
Any spectator watching films about the investigation knows very well that only from lycometery is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated in public shames the obligation of hypocrisy and sheds bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most classified information of the world’s most powerful country is a hard blow, not a negligible one, for the prestige of this State Department.
The scandal affects both victims and their “executor”
But let us go from here to the profound truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell’s prophecy has been proven since the possibility of controlling every movement with the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, the citizen has become a total victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even the tombs, with the most secret information of the powerful, cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a orbiter.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker, elected as a citizen’s pastor, can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an inseparable secret (and the inseparable secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, uninvasive secret, because it is drawn out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secret was an inseparable secret, means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something great to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound be so significant?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive online information - this would be equivalent to its publication on a poster glued on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely clear that with the current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep the message on the phone confidential.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will they be able to keep private and sensitive messages confidential in the future?
I know well that for the moment, the prognosis belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who carry discreetly fulfilling formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry only messages that know the memory or rather hide rare information in the heel of the shoe.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-closed drawers: overall, an attempt to spy on Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph was a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephonics).
Video cassettes (analogs) have allowed cinema lovers to take a step-by-step movie, move it forward and back and uncover all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digits) allow only to jump through chapters, that is, after macropores.
We will travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while we will travel by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn vehicles.
Last note.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was falling asleep in the secret of the embassy.
They are now embassies demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to comply with the promises for quickly unblocked funding (named fast start or early start financing), implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks have been revealed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to making $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (that is €420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled out a large ace to convince its partners about the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010 it released €2.2 billion, bringing it on the right track to comply with its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are new and additional to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus in what “new and additional” means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to the three-year fast start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of all new projects - 2010 - is new and additional -
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publish au développement.
In particular, France's overall support for developing countries may remain unchanged (or even reduced) to comply with its commitment to financing of new and additional...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ donated.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for some investments that are profitable (often related to emission reduction projects, consisting in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we will receive, as equivalent to one euro we give... . . . we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of a loan for a creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rate).
But France can only make such a justification: ‘it respects’ its commitment of €420 million, of which it makes up €91.5% of the loan (€389.8 million) and €8.5% of donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only EU country to use a loan on that scale.
Germany has claimed 46% of this, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) have adhered to their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to satisfy its promise, France will only give 10 cents and consider this effort comparable.
A beautiful cup of tea!
For a summary, in its financing -fast start - France operates with double scaffolding: on the one hand, with the development of the action in time and on the other hand, with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only €36.1 million, it is able to convince that it spends €420 million - new and additional - in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy, who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The early financing chapter is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early financing.
First, France should announce the change in its way of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and decency and justice towards other European Union countries.
But above all, France should avoid discussing deposits in long-term financing (another essential chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of ‘Additionality’ or the way in which loans are charged.
France should change its position to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
Thus, all hope to be put in the new Minister for the Environment, Ms Koscia-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France’s fast start-up and its vision of additionality, and the use of loans, could lead to an increase in the level of international trust necessary to allow further discussion.
An alarm regarding pesticides that children will see.
A ten-year-old child will see one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published on this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex- Movement for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which notes that its results do not have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed problem, has purchased between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child about ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is crushing: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive for internal-mixed glands (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
“Although in almost all cases the statutory limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research, we well see that the reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic substances, and/or PE is striking,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain in themselves about ten solutions with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty hemoglobins that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, referred to as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including in France a banned fungicide.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, ground meat bifts, tuna in the can and even mushrooms and chewing gums have been soiled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In water from the tap analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was \"the richest\" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave oven did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this ‘contaminant cocktail’ is likely to be underestimated, according to a study.
The Society Ecological Europe-Greening (EE-LV) has proposed that it is creating a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the rise of civilizational diseases.
In a July study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), it examined the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
