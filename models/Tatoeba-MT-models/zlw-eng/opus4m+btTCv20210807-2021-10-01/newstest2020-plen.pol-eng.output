Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white suit
He's a charismatic.
The Holy Mass for the liberation and healing of those who are given it is the crowds.
He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
The Mass of Saints for the Liberation and Healing are drawn up by the crowds.
Once upon a time, the parents of a 7-month-old child, who had a hole of 7.5 mm in his heart, came to him.
It was supposed to be operated.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Astonished physicians said: “Operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5mm”
My parents cried out of happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience already as a teenager.
In his dreams, the cleaning souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was going on with the man who committed mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and began to take on the appearance of the animal,” he says.
The invisible force carried him up, he couldn’t get out of his voice.
He felt he was lost.
Then God told him to save him.
“I have been freed in the waters of a river that symbolizes holy baptism, and I have returned to human form,” he says.
He didn’t tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a vocation in it.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
He not only wanted to talk about Jesus in the sermons.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renewing Community in the Holy Spirit
In the Masses for the Healing of Father Witko there are many people who are counting on getting rid of the disease.
The spiritual one, however, emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
The first failure of Kolping Frac Jarosław
Today (September 26th) in the afternoon, the Kolpinga FRAC team earned its current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
Jarosławs in such a personal comparison as they presented with the Grodzišcans have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
He clearly showed this battle with Darto Bogoria.
The team is still missing, citing the team leader Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps in the composition of the Jarosławs would have reached the third in a row triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han may not have been able to win with such dozens as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis and the Czech Republic Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The Hellady player was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSIR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three duels, the Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei was probably played by Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górk after an exciting five-hundred-hundred fight by Paul Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
It was possible to hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why not?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free prevention studies for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Medical Technology and Tarification Agency.
The agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
“The above actions can even result in the detection of individual disease units, which can contribute to deepening the difficulty of accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive research results,” the study said.
The decision of the Ministry does not understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we’ve provided for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely about leading to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard to imagine that proficient specialists say, ‘Let’s not study because there will be longer lines with a doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I’m not surprised that health care is in this state,’ he added.
Palestine says to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at a UN General Assembly session that he would break any agreements with Israel if the country’s future government tried to meet Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, which will arise, comes to the realization of this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” Abbas said.
\"It is our duty to defend all our rights with every possible means - little importance, which will be the consequences - fully involved in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,\" said the president of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, Israel’s premier, was re-elected after the 17 September elections to form a government.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and would include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements to which the United States was patronized.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised the United Nations General Assembly to hold universal elections on the land of Palestine.
The last was held in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all who oppose them will have to be responsible for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers of \"full members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions.\"
The Palestinian leader ended the speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to fulfill with all due respect the provisions of the United Nations”
Israel’s ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’ speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader “will focus at the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than fighting the calls to terrorism in autonomy under his leadership.”
Danon, as reported by the agencies, did not, however, refer to Netanyahu’s annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
The rescuers want defibrillators at the newralgious points of Przemysl
The story of the border crossing shows that the AED automatic defibrillator can save human life.
The Regional Rescue Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be in the newralgic points of the city.
The officers received congratulations from the Regional Emergency Station in Przemyśl.
The applicant Daniel Cyrnek, the senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Subcarpathian Tax Office in Przemysl.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medicine.
The Chinese activist died in custody because of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
To Cao Shuxia, an activist’s wife, a Communist Party secretary called on 23 September from her home village to report that the husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
In the skeleton, Cao saw the body of her husband massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, his ears, his nose and his mouth were all in his blood,” says the woman.
“They didn’t allow me to take my cells with them, and there were a lot of policemen around who couldn’t get close to Wang.
Police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband had been seriously ill and died of a “unhappily accident”
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN program.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a real-world map along with an application that allows users to transfer data; a test-training platform for verifying practical skills at work and professional improvement using VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating real-life production process management using an innovative model of virtual-world interaction with the real-world concept of industry 4.0.
The goal of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game producers in the global market by 2023.
According to the NBBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the already 300 million PLN of support for entrepreneurs under this sector program is an important driver for the further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev,” the statement reads.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective exploitation of the potential we have in Poland.
“The government-led incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R&D reliefs, competence improvement programmes, IP boxing, and support programmes carried out by the NCBR drive innovative business and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the science department points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of funding projects, but also remains in their pockets - with the relief of the R&D in 2018, three-quarters more entrepreneurs than the year before.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&D’s activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN,” said the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of the NBBR dr. engineer Wojciech Kamiecki reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in the two previous co-financing competitions with a total value of more than PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest of the third competition and the variety of proposals submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantage.
“In particular, the fact that among the selected projects - as in previous editions - there are projects for solutions for not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0 - adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply.
87 applications for the total amount of co-financing of PLN 317 million were affected by the NCB.
The budget of the competition at the time of the contest was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million of funding.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector program is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Game Agreement, including companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admits to stealing Kasper Dolberg watch
The event occurred on September 16.
At the end of August, Dolberg, who went from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.
It wasn’t because it was worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane did not appear in classes the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the very beginning.
The players in the dressing room have private safes and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga was finally admitted to theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the band and coach Patrick Vieira.
I also promised a Danish man to pay for his watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to make his first team debut three years later.
He played in seven games this season.
Recently, he signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper said, “L’Equipe”, the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
So far, he has started disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. when they arrive at home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to clean enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
Most of us wash them less!
It is enough warm water and ordinary soap - it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them).
When washing, we rub not only the bottoms and the uppers of the hand, but also: finger tips (connected or individually) - rub them with circular movements with the interior of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (swipe your hands, wiping your fingers about yourself), thumbs - we cover each thumb with the other hand, and in such a embrace we turn it for a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when it is impossible to wash hands) we should wipe our hands with a wet wipe, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugs, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the hand-washed handles or doors (recommendation from the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through a paper towel.
Iran’s president says he has rejected the U.S.’s offer of talks, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not speak to the U.S. side during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite an offer made by Americans to abolish sanctions, Iran’s President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the abolition of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans proposed to abolish all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on the new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear program and the ballistic missile construction program.
Rowhani: Iran will not hold talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
Iran’s president said he did not agree to take these talks because of “a toxic atmosphere.”
He said he met with U.S. diplomats because he was the leader of France, Germany and the UK.
However, he stressed that Iran would not hold talks in the atmosphere of “maximal pressure.”
“Even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be,” Rowhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US, and the European side of the nuclear deal denied favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a prerequisite that does not allow for dialogue.
If we manage to endure this prerequisite and if America abolishes sanctions and maximum pressure, then, of course, we can talk to America,” he said.
He said he did not rule out meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the U.N. General Assembly last week.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no.
Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the request from the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to abolish the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said “no!” - tweeted the President of the United States.
Tension with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tension between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 deal with Iran, which they were signatories.
In exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would resign from the nuclear weapons construction programme and the nuclear sector would be controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain an agreement.
For now, none of this has worked out.
Washington is using a tactic of imposing maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive an export licence, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Voivodship Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the captain Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsApp, participated in a stalking against the judges, was restored to court on Wednesday.
Reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not so far been transformed into an action against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge who publicly talked about the mental problems of his wife to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the captain group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to the ruling and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Smydt denies his participation in the foster group.
He claims that there is no evidence except for the falsified screens and the words of his wife with whom he is divorced.
The same is true of the other judges’ connection with the “Cast”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll bet on their own.
Because the prosecutor's office didn't kick a finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, he's also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which the phone stopped in June on another case.
The police did not kick their fingers to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a February report.
There is no evidence - there is no matter of Smydt, there is no matter \"Casty\"
There is also no matter of the head of NIK Mariana Banasia about renting a tenement house to basements and hiding income.
CBA checks his property statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
Again, the Commission for the Ethics of the Messengers will not take care of Banasim, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Commission for State Control has somehow come together to take a curious decision on the appeal of Banasia's alternates and his appointment as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a new film, American, probably, about how the wife returns home and finds her husband in bed with her lover.
She is so amazed and angry that she can't make a word.
She was standing in the door, and at that time, the lover quickly jumped out of bed, dressed and left.
And the husband made the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams, what is it?
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, “What woman, honey?”
But the case of \"Kasta - whether Banasia is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final jump up
Earlier this season, she returned to the competition after the break of the motherly athlete, the bronze medalist of the 2017 London World Championship, in her first attempt to beat 1,85 and 1,89, and in the second 1,92.
1.94 was achieved only in the third approach.
\"I'm happy.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to wait more technically,\" Lićwinko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
The best were the American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karina Demidik, after 1.94.
Both players were the only ones who did not lose any height.
The women’s jump final was scheduled for Monday.
Beginning at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in a difficult state
He came to the hospital, and doctors call his condition severe.
It must be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will come out of it, that he will win again.
We all pray that he will return to health,” said Kornel Morawiecki, an anonymous close person, in an interview with the journalists of Super Express.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister’s father is running for the Senate.
“I am kept alive by the closest family and politics,” Kornel Morawiecki told reporters in an interview two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been researched at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and reported to the hospital.
Turns out I have a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a computer tomographer was conducted, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer,” the Prime Minister’s father said.
A few days later, at the MSWA hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and passed successfully.
“I know many people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don’t have any mentions.
I don't know yet if I'm going to undergo chemotherapy.
I put myself in the hands of doctors who are rather good at thinking.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to go back to some usability.
I hope everything will be fine,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with “SE” in January.
“If I had been under investigation too late, the situation would have been tragic, and I’d have said goodbye to this crash,” he added.
Krakow: 14-year-old missing

When she was last seen, she was dressed in blouses, gray pants and shoes.

The power of the Olympic jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September on the hypodrome at Oleandy Street in Oław, can be confusing for some.
For to the true power the way is far away, but that is what is called one of the types of horse competition...
The competition for the power of jumps is to overcome by a rider and a horse an increasing obstacle, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.
It is worth adding that the long-standing and still unbreakable world record, established in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse \"Huaso\" is 247 cm.
No one jumped so high in Olav, of course, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not one of the worst.
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS “In the saddle” were an exhibition part of the previously played “Trucz riding competitions”, about which we write more widely in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
There were eight amazons who trained in the Olympic JKS.
Four of them competed on the pucks and four on the big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szóldra, who had a crazy “Sprinter”, was best placed.
This small, but how dynamic, rumak began by overcoming obstacles spread at 40 cm height, and ended only at the station with a upper beam away from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three subsequent refusals, he was removed from competition by the jury.
The second place in the jumps of the pucks was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who received \"Fams - and the third by Lena Borun on \"Harmider -\"
Ambitiously, the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles to the small lamentation \"Carmen -\"
Even more emotions were accompanied by starting amazons and spectators during the competition involving large horses.
The dangerous falls were counted by Paulina Szewczyk, who received the \"Declaration\" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was driving on \"Flight\"
Fortunately, no harm happened to horses outside of the small cracks or amazons, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young lager \"Winet - the parker was located in Veronika Luczkiewicz.
She needed either an assistant coach or another horse for a pair, behind which she muttered a little crazy \"Winet -\"
After counting the obstacles from the park, she also ran down full-scale, so for moments in the boxing and expansion rooms it was dangerous. “Everything is under control,” silhouetted Jan Sienkiewicz a bit of those frightened viewers, especially the youngest.
Since the beginning of the competition, Marta Masalska has been writing in the park park, which is a beautiful presentation of \"Whisky\"
This handsome stick, paired with an experienced amazon, followed a second approach in the final stage, was the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result at this point in time.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also counted the same height on “Declaration - Weronika Luczkiewicz on “Winet” and Anastasia Abramko on “Flight”
For the decoration of flo and after the reception of the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these players left together, and in the end together with the amazons on the curls in the tact of the Radecki march performed an impressive honor round, ending these interesting and exciting professions.
Thanks
The Riding Sports Club “In Siodle” is warmly thanked to sponsors of the jump power competition during the XVI “Tęczowe Jeżeżeczkie Competition”: the Municipal Office in Olav, the Water and Sewering Plant in Oław, the Powiatów Mayor and the “Mustang” company.
Max Kolonko cut off from the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation of the #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko itself failed to even collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he ended cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
I will expect my name to be deleted from my name.
Please feel free not to connect my person with the subject mentioned,” he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue to act, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, the American Independence Day, the American journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, reported on the rise of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the government to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
The party’s agenda included issues concerning the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (comparing the amount tax-free for all), reparations of war (in the form of military assistance for NATO’s eastern flag countries, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on arms ownership, limiting the number of Members or introducing single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the creation of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting #R would join forces with the Kukiz movement.
However, none of these coalitions eventually happened.
UBS: Gold near the balance point
“The euro course will remain in the vicinity of a PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months, accompanied by a weak global market economy,” says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak for stabilizing gold quotations on the current ceiling,” said the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.
Despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its feet in an environment where the vast majority of central banks ease policy.
“As long as the gold is properly valued, the euro’s quotations should remain in the vicinity of the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months, so little attractive are Polish bonds.
Much more profitable profitability from Polish securities is offered by bonds from emerging markets, says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging UBS Wealth Management.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world’s economy.
“Global slowdown can go even further, but there should be no severe recession, and at the most, the GDP dynamics will fall slightly below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should underestimate global stocks that may be detrimental to the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be relatively weak, according to the latest letter to investors by UBS’ chief executive, Mark Haefele.
“The euro area action should behave worse than the US because it is more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty about global trade and fears of slowing down,” the document said.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa on the bonds markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of the German 10-year-old even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the profitability.
However, in the long run, long-term securities should no longer be profitable, but only short-term ones, thanks to the mitigation of bank monetary policy.
The Fed has the largest rate reduction field, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.
The long-term balance point for euro quotations is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean 19% potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed’s rates, which will result in a decrease in the world’s monetary policy gap.
“To maintain the dollar’s strength in the long run, they may not allow deficits in the current and budget accounts,” says Michael Bolliger.
Bundeswehr's gonna lose his gun.
The confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and 19,445 ammunition, according to a confidential statement drawn up in the German Defense Ministry.
The information was provided by a press belonging to the media group EditorationsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office of the Secretary of State in MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the gun and 3474 ammunition have been re-recorded.
Among the military equipment that remains missing is: six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns, and two P8 guns.
In addition, it lacks 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns.
The situation was expressed by the Vice-President of the Left, Martin Renner.
As she told journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “surprising.”
More importantly, only a small portion of the lost equipment was found as a result of the investigations.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “bad balance sheet”
She also criticized the fact that the report did not show whether there was a weapon found during an investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was denied the preparation of attacks on the leading German politicians from extreme right and racist motives.
On his \"black list\" - the targets that came into the hands of the prosecutor's office, were, among others, the then Justice Minister Heiko Maas of SPD, Claudio Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally owned four pieces of firearms, over 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people for whom traveling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of the seats on the aircraft.
If a given connection travels a minor to the second year of life, “the icon of the child appears on a specific, reserved by the parents or guardians of the seat.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place remote from that occupied by the child.
The BBC says the lines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
“A child’s icon will not appear when a ticket has been booked by a third party or if at the last minute there has been a change in the plane.
As expected, the idea was shared by internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They were children, and we were once.
“We need to learn tolerance, because we’ll soon start needing maps of places that are sitting for breathing mouths, slimming or drunks,” said G Sundar.
Another Internet user noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on a plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me of screaming children on a 13-hour trip,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca Counts Loss After Bankruptcy by Thomas Cook Travel Agency
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come on holiday to Majorca in October as a result of a bankruptcy by travel agency Thomas Cook on Monday.
On Friday, a representative of the autonomous government of the Marc Pons Balearic Islands, among 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take October leave at Majorca, are also persons who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of holidaymakers expected to leave Majorca next month were German and Scandinavian citizens.
However, according to Pons, because Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic Islands in November-April, losses for the local economy will be lower.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on “entering the market of Majorca,” following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the newspaper “Diario de Mallorca”, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are freed staff from Thomas Cook's office in Palmia.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hospitality sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many major hotels, the owners of the facility requested guests to pay an additional fee for the accommodation.
This situation was experienced, among others, by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had stopped operating until at least the end of October due to the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and the companies cooperating with him.
On the other hand, the Friday newspaper “Diario de Ibiza” indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that worked with Thomas Cook are not intended to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this balearic island, the British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, Balearic Islands’ autonomous authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with €100 million to cover losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They found that the most victims of this archipelago of tourists, about 36,000 people, are located in Majorca.
According to the Balearic Islands government, Thomas Cook is advocating local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of July-September 2019 contracts around €5 million.

\"Rz: Smog caught up by the government
“The effects of the “clean air” program are nickel, and coal stoves will kick this winter as if never anything,” reads on the front page of today’s “Rzeczpospolita”
“To date, 82 000 applications have been submitted under the Clean Air programme to fund a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48,000 were positive.
Accepted proposals contribute more than PLN 915 million in total, according to the “Rz”, citing data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are returned from the programme.
The results of the announced noise program are assessed as ‘slightly’.
The self-governors, quoted by “Rz,” consider the failures of “Clean Air”, among others, in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible random random control of implementation.
This would improve activities, says the Mayor of Warminski Jacek Wisniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that less than 1% of the goal of replacing 3 million boilers was achieved in the first year of operation.
According to the report, “The budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion per 10 years, or PLN 10 billion annually, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, PLN 1.4 billion was reserved for this year,” he said.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now the price negotiations
The U.S. Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
“This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work,” wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price,” the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
Polish Air Forces have a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Poland agreed to sell them to the U.S. Department of State.
The Communication underlines that the investment will support U.S. national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The Department of State noted that the contract will also include the delivery of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, the performance of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics and program support and staff training.
The Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II fighter, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a one-seat and single-engine fifth-generation multi-task fighter.
The aircraft is capable of performing a mission of close support, bombing and typically hunting air combat tasks.
With stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short range radars.
Recently, F-35 fighters bought Belgium under a $4.5 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the F-16.
The purchase of US warplanes will also be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of sex-neutral dolls on the market.
This is how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie manufacturer launches a series of sex-neutral dolls on the market
In addition to Barbie’s different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced gender neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the series \"Creatable World\" are worn by pearls.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their outfit consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the fog of the eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different colors of the skin and with different clothes.
The gender dolls are no longer full of mouths, long eyelashes and slim waists, or, in the case of Ken, wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have imposed sexual norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for specific sex inhibit the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel said.
Barbie's doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in high-haired bathingwear and shoes, has been repeatedly criticized for promoting \"unhealthy female stereotypes\" such as unnatural body proportions.
The company has responded to criticism and has already launched dolls of different colors of the skin, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: a circle or club together may have several members
Zandberg, asked on the ZET radio, how many candidates his party could get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the list is launched by candidates to the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo \"Left\", replied that it depends on the outcome of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are hoping that the Left is not only right, but also has the strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left could have 60-80 members.
“This may mean that a circle or club together will have several members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
“I’m not going to guess and tell you how this will happen,” he said.
When asked if the Left would have a separate circle together, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that, in different ways, we were able to agree on a common programme -
Asked if the largest beneficiary of the joint start, is the leader of the SLD, Vladimir Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he believes that the largest beneficiaries are the centrale and left voters.
In turn, he said that the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, saying that “the political party’s goal is to represent its voters.”
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further.
“But I would say very honestly and clearly that if I had found myself in District 44 of the Senate, I would have taken the electoral certificate and voted in another district,” he said.
“I would not like to give my voice to Minister Casimir Ujazdowski (KO-PAP candidate)” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of Polish citizens Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start.
Dakar: World's Largest Mosque Opened in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by buses, cars and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque could hold 30,000 faithful.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, belonging to the Sufi current of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
The work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, transmitted by the government.
The name Massalikul Jinan (the Path to Paradise) comes from the poem of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, revered by the followers as saints.
The mosque is surrounded by Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle will house 15,000 faithful, and the second can be on the outer esplanade.
In richly finished interiors, you can admire a gilded dome, gigantic chandeliers and decorations hand-made by workers from Morocco.
The builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II mosque in Casablanca can hold 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed from private donations.
In addition to the ground, the government funded lighting, sanitary facilities and financed 10.5 million euros of road robots.
Smyła Coach: Our problem is not Silesia, only we ourselves
A pass of eight league matches without winning, the Koron players will try to stop in a Friday meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian Extraclass.
“Our problem is not to be Wrocława, only we ourselves, we must work on what we play,” said Mirosław Smyła.
The last players and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first row when they defeated 1:0 Benjamin of the Częstochowa Cancers.
Later, the Kielcans recorded two draws and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Lubin Basin in 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic about the fact that in the last seconds of the cup game the players fought for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the masonry after the last whistle was not due to the collapse, but it was the fall of anger, because they were so close,” Smła said.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will sensitize the team to play in the lateral sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In Friday’s match in the Korona, he will certainly not play a pause for the excess yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, as well as the injuries of Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will be missed.
It’s difficult to compete in a cup game with a few players who want to play.
“We had a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be, and now it is,” Smła said.
Defender Daniel Dziwiel stressed that Śląsk will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without winning, while in an extraclass anyone can win with everyone.
“We are a good team.
“In recent weeks, we may not show it on the field, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday,” the footballer said.
After nine lines of extraclass, the Crown with a profit of five points takes 15th position.
Silesia gathered 12 more and ranked in second place.
Friday's match in Kielce will begin at 20.30.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
“42% of the species of trees forming the trees of Europe are at risk,” warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on Friday’s Red Book of European Trees.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and hawks.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was developed by experts who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are \"highly at risk.\"
Among the reasons, the Red Paper lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
According to IUCN experts, 58% of species are at risk, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the operation of the tree, accelerated urbanization, too intense tree cutting, and further forest fires and changes taking place in the European ecostytmy.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and mosses is also strongly threatened.
“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and create a danger of extinction in Europe of important and undervalued varieties, which form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,” said Luc Bas, head of the European IUCN office.
Gregory Schetyn: I won't promise 600+
“Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles, offering them the freedom to spend on a loan that will have to be paid back by future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, \"The whole PIS policy is pic-
At the same time, the politician promises that \"what is given will not be taken away -
In an interview with Jackie Nizinkiewicz, Schetin has the idea of defeating Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the electoral urns.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than the Kaczyński party.
“Today, the conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than the supporters of the PiS, a party that has mistrusted its stated values, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” she said.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the President of the Civic Platform also noted the basic assumptions of the KO electoral programme.
“First of all, nothing about data will be taken away, but it is necessary to set the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about \"starting the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work fairly - and those who are entrepreneurs -
Schetina explains that there was a project in KO program, which will give the least earning Poles more about 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners - also after several hundred.
The politician also said he didn’t want to race for the show.
He said he'd do as much as he could, but he didn't promise 600+.
“I will never allow a Greek variant where the rulers were counting on the opposition to handing over until the country’s financial collapse finally occurred,” he said.
In an interview with Rz, Schetyna also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“We would expose them to hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“The pride goes before the fall.
Kaczynski is a man of state like Banas is crystal,” he added.
The PO leader also said he had not yet decided whether to apply for the platform’s leadership.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors
Six dead large condors were found in Argentina’s Santa Cruz province, TVN24 said.
Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large condoms were probably poisoned by a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes, or wild dogs.
Animals could eat toxic paddlin.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condoms were grown up.
“This is a big loss to the environment, because the condom must reach 10-15 years to become fruitful and capable of propagating.
So we are losing the protected species, the endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, Argentina’s environmental protection organization.
“I think the use of toxic bait and poison not only puts this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he added.
RZ: They want a jewel for the president
Work has been carried out on granting the head of the state of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda - read in \"Rzeczpospolita\"
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called during the period of the interwar gem of the Republic of Poland.
The last time he was used was probably by President Ignacy Mościcki.
\"Rz - reports that soon such a chain can hit the arms of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on amending the Orders and Rewards Act to restore it.
It is also not the first attempt to restore this chain of the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it disappeared with one voice.
This time the work is instant.
In early August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, recognizing that they would seek the opinion of the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I would like to inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” said Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
\"The President's office responded briefly: it is behind this to restore,\" said the head of the committee Robert Mamątov of PiS, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a request for legislative work supported by the Commission.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the crossroads
The police action will be carried out, among others, at the crossroads of al. Ciepliński and al. Pilsudski.
The uniform activities are somehow linked to recent complaints from the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27th, police officers begin preventive activities in Rzeszów \"Transitional crossings -
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering the crossroads without the possibility of exit, not applying to light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and we are actually making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobinski, the city’s vice president.
His words sounded at a press conference of the city hall, where the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars at crossings, which in turn creates traffic jams.
Then the president appealed to travellers for reason on the road, including faster light-starting or not writing SMS while driving.
The theme was taken over by the Rzeszov police, who are starting the action from now on.
What's going on?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting traffic at crossings by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
This is a frequent violation that contributes to the strengthening of obstacles in movement and the formation of traffic jams.
It is threatened with a 300 PLN mandate and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and improper parking in the area of crossings.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late moving from the signals, free crossings and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At what crossings will the actions be carried out?
E.g. at Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellońska Street; al. Ciepliński from al. Piłsudski Street; ul. Targowa from al. Piłsudski Street; Square of Śreniawitów from ul. Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmanska Street from al. Warsaw Uprising.
Such shares in the capital of Podkarpacie will be held on the following Fridays of October.
They checked the company that stifled the waste from \"Takki\"
“The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the District of Wołomiński and the District Inspection of Construction Control checked on Friday the installation in Zelenka district, where waste from wastewater treatment plants “Tchaika - in Warsaw - informed the spokesperson of the mayor of Wołomiński Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors from the Volómiński district carried out a check at a plant located in forests belonging to the Zielonka municipality.
The “Dar-Trans” commercial and transport facility, under a contract with the “Takka” borough treatment plant, provides waste management services.
“The inspection of the installation was completed, and the entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
He added that the inspection report will be submitted, among others, to the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The final inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out sampling, measurement and research of groundwater, and also did not have the results of the research of stabilized municipal sewage settlements from wastewater treatment plants.
After the control of the WIOS, Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the terms of the decision.
“DAR-Trans - Dariusz Saturday is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage settlements from the “Tchaika” treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal in the production site, wastes of up to 60,000 tonnes per year are processed in the forests of the Greens wheel.
Last Thursday, the Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewer Company reported that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOŚ was shut down, which was related to the damage of one of the combustion plants.
According to MPWIK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my total support,” said Lech Wałęsa to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
“Mr President, this is a very important word for me,” said the candidate of the Civic Coalition for the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now \"only a fan of retirement -
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre.
In a short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by the son of Wałęsa - Jarosław.
“You have taken on a difficult task,” said Lech Wałęsa.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems ahead of Poland are known to us all.
That is why we hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and we all - those who love Poland - will support your actions as much as possible,\" said the former president, referring to Kidawy-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
“Lord President, this is a very important word for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution, and knows how important it is,” she said.
“Let us show that another wise policy can be made together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, in accordance with respect for others.
The Lord did this to his revolution, and we want to change Poland,” said Kidawa-Błońska.
Kibic in retirement
Wałęsa told reporters that he is now “only a retired fan”
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will turn back the course of events, that what was good, tested, (to this) we will return.
The division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessarily needed.
And all this has to be cleaned, all this has to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we will do it.
“If not, then we have a street criterion,” said Lech Wałęsa.
“That’s why it’s so important for Poles to go to elections, think and make their own decisions.
And that’s the most important thing,” said Kidawa-Błońska.
“The last chance that we will improve the state of things in Poland with a sheet,” the former president said.
“We need to build a foundation again.
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The President said very well.
We must rebuild the foundation on which we can do all other things.
Since there is no division of power, since the constitution is not respected, we must return to the beginning and make it clear and that all know that otherwise Poland will not move forward.

The Senate decided on key laws
The Senate passed without amending the Act on the Disclosure of Property of the Family of the Most Important State Officials and on Flights of the Most Important Persons in the State.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Act on the property of the families of state officials - without amendments - 14 opposed, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments submitted during the Wednesday debate by Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to “civilise” and limit the scope of information given in the statement on the property situation of their own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make a statement.

The law also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted against the bill, 12 opposed, and four abstained.
According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight \"perpetrated in the official mission -
In flights, the president will be able to accompany family members and others invited by the president of the person.
On the other hand, on the mission of the official Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, only a flight will be carried out \"to carry out tasks directly related to the full function -
The law also specifies the list of persons who can accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations on board the aircraft, members of the delegation may be invited Members, Senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational support; as well as journalists.
In accordance with the law, in the event of doubts about the flights of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.

Poles after first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish Volcanoes held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will perform on Saturday for a bronze medal.
Vitala Heynen’s post-war journey to win the title closed Thursday’s defeat with Slovenes 1:3 in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of trouble with their trip to the duel.
This time it was without such problems - on Friday morning they went along with the Slovenians charter to Paris, and a few hours later they held training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the relationships of the people present in the classes, the world champions’ trainer was underscored.
As assistant Heynena Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not to exercise the mesh elements themselves.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was a time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it as a team, he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to earth.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We still believed that we would return to this game.
We discussed this match with each other at the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would indicate ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this regard, he analyzed.
In his opinion, \"White-Red - he did not prevent stress associated with the performance against the loud and numerous audiences of the tournament's co-hosts.
He admitted that the world champions could sleep a little on the smooth road to the semi-finals.
“It may be that if we had a similar style of failure in the group phase, we would have analyzed this lesson more quickly, and then we would have played differently in the next stage of the tournament.
But it’s only when he’s scared, he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Thursday defeat of Poles will turn into aggression in the game of bronze.
“I hope we show our true face.
There's something to fight about.
“We won the ME medal in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, they went to Apeldoorn for the first two meetings of the group phase, and they moved to Ljubljana to the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player has received a 16-week start ban and a $25,000 fine - in a half-year suspension - for the relentless words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour players lose patience to Kyrgios, but they still give him the chance to improve.
The summaries of the most uncircumcised professional tennis player of recent years look dangerous - 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year - a trial period in which a athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he’s been working for a long time and he’s done some kind of tennis record in the world; he’s had to pay the highest discipline in history a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behavior on and next to the court.
The loud curses, strange gestures, unsportable behavior, insulting the judge and viewers, breaking two missiles during the lost match with Karen Chachanov - all after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113 thousand.
In the U.S. Open 2019, he did not play long, but he publicly managed to say that the ATP activists were “corrupted,” which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks, they filed the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of startups and another fine.
The words of corruption, however, were forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the speech.
However, according to the tennis activists, the investigation showed that the behavior of Kyrgios for the entire 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted almost constant violations of the rules that he was constantly insulting vulgar people related to tournaments and viewers, hence a high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering that several conditions be fulfilled within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments, he can no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy missiles, argue with judges and the public, nor any other way to behave indecently and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and outside the season to consult those specializing in solving the problems of athletes who are not dealing with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first commentary on the verdict was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all -
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, because in the Lavera Cup, his shoulder injury worsened, so he had to give up the nearest launches in Beijing (30 September-6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP Kyrgios ranking, it ranks 27th.
This year, he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: We live better in Poland
According to a report published by GUS on household budgets on Friday, 44 per cent of households have evaluated their material situation as good or rather good.
The previous year was 37.2%, 33.5% in 2016 and before, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
In total, 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of people working on their own account.
Over 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good in this group.
In the second pole there are household rencists, where the proportion of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of the household.
The worst of them is the single parenting of offspring, of which 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, and among childless households is 48.8%.
In these statistics, the 500+ effect is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst of its material situation was assessed by parents alone raising offspring and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of the subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
However, this is not all because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households at the level of the province.
The best ratings are formulated by the residents of the Opole province, where 48.9% of the surveyed consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are further Lubuskie provinces (47.7 per cent), Silesian (47.6 per cent), Mazowieckie (47.3 per cent) and Western Pomerania (47.1 per cent).
Meanwhile, in Opolski, the governmental income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average, and 98% in Lubusk.
The highest incomes were in Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average, in Poland, income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after the price change correction) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These conversions per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, spending on a person increased by 1.9%, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Studies on household budgets suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its management income, while in 2014 it still exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

U.S.: Three suicides among aircraft crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, five crew members of the ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors were shot last week.
Each event occurred on land when USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, death should not be associated with each other.
“It is necessary for everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent further suicide.
“I want to stress that there is no stigmatization or other repercussion related to the search for help,” Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, wrote on Facebook.
Uncertainty critically about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiółowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“Each of his opinions was accepted.”
Then came criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzik, he was placed a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist, a pest to the Church and Poland, has developed his media into the best Pope Polak’s life, he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were mutilations of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, once Rydzika did not accept, but he had power, and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, like his successors,” explained Niesilołowski.
“Apart from this came this fatal matter of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, and indeed of their lack.
I went a little ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole shape of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters,” he says in an interview with journalist Niesilołowski.
In the assessment of the former policy, the Polish Church is an ally of PIS.
“It must be admitted that during the period of solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Mass, everywhere there were crosses hanging.
Now these crosses are psy, they have become a symbol of dictatorship, a sign of the psy regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing on this matter, and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay him saltily,” the Nessilowski said.
“I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he concluded.

Gryf Disqualified
The clash in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk with a small hair did not end tragically, when the goalkeeper, Zlatana Alomerovici, fired by fans from Wejherowa race about millimetres passed.
After the incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.

Burdy in the stadium Videwa Łódź also called for fans of Silesia Wrocław.
Here, however, the judgment of the PZPN was milder, because Śląsk predicted that similar events could occur and made the competent authorities feel about the issue.
Despite this, the services allowed the sector to be abandoned by the Łódź fans by the races, the burning of chairs and the promotion of the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use a water gun.

The names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange markings across the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the recording of foreign names of cities on road signs also began in Polish.
For example, \"The Lions - will appear next to \"L'viv\"
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, easier to read and easier.
The new guidelines stem from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the village in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change we have prepared in the law, they will finally appear on the roadsides.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway, said the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
The subcarpathian changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
£200,000.
First of all, the new label will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What is the implementation of the idea?
It will be done without replacing the plates, on the basis of glues.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the new towns, written in Polish on the already existing characters.
Both names will be written in one row - first in Polish, then in the original, in the brackets.
This will be a great convenience for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from the windmill
In the pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with problems with wings.
After fishing and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone set a target from the animal - in his body there was a shot from the windmill.
“The information about the injured bird was received from the village residents of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sola.
It was reported that the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately seen that something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to harm him or expose him to additional stress.
The shark was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first photo of the X-ray, it was already known that someone had made it a shooting shield.
In his body, there were fragments of the screw,” says Marcin Walasek, CEO of Malpol, a centre of rehabilitation, among others.
It's cold in the center.
The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water was provided, a safe place in the resort, where he spent all winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He's not able to fly yet.
He would probably not survive the winter,” Walasek added.
The staff intends to release him to the same pond in the spring after he undergoes a rehabilitation slab.
The authorities of the Zhukowice municipality, after receiving information about the contribution of the animal’s poor health, intend to inform the prosecutor’s office.
The event occurred in Zamecno
Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“True taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin said during a conversation in the “Symnosts of the Day” in Radio Joneca that trade is controlled by international networks that impose so low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot develop.
Note that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but received a “contraversy from the EC”
“We have won the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the nearest elections and formulates the government, we will return to this topic,” he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that \"effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, thus small trade -
“In addition, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has some instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake considering that the Polish retail tax was an illegal public aid.
The Act on Retail Sales Tax provided for the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% of revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% of revenue over PLN 170 million per month.
The tax has been in force since September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission opened infringement proceedings by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then stated that the tax was implemented unlawfully.
It also issued an order to suspend the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The decision of the EU court in May opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed in the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSU's press services reported to the PAP that the case is currently in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure will start, i.e., listening to the parties and a possible report.
It takes a good few to a few months from bringing an appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“This is the case for an average year,” a source at the Luxembourg Tribunal said in a statement.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer several practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of a baby and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity that the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating its appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look as good as possible on that day.
However, before you make the final decision on your baby’s outfit, consider whether it will also be convenient.
In the shops you can find a lot of outfits that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The primary criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, several-week-old little ones were baptized, arranged into white sets and put into the same bets or big olfactories.
Today, children acceding to the sacrament are often older: several months, a year or even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a great comfort already needs a slightly different clothing for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of Baptism, he will probably spend the celebration in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or the baptized.
The best way out is to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping or completes.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a daily outfit, it is enough to search for its sacred variants, for example, with a falbank or lace.
For the boy, it will turn out to be points with the print of the flycloth and shelves.
In the case of older children, you can afford a larger fantasy in the dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tulle dress
Many parents of girls with a seal look towards richly decorated, falsified dresses for baptism in a set of coats, straps and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-shaling materials in which the child is simply inconvenient.
In search of suitable clothing, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and cute sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Perfect dress for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of the boys, there was a fashion for suits that were a copy of \"adults - models.
Polyester jackets and pants, rigid collars or helmets often made young elegance loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were driven away by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, dressing pants, and for this blouse decorated in front of a vest pattern.
These machines look extremely sacred, and at the same time do not spoil the movements of a child who knows the world.
Krystyna Pavlowicz
Krystyna Pavlowicz made a statement of property at the end of her term of office.
It follows that the messenger of the PiS has collected 110 thousand zlotys of savings.
Let us remind you that Pavlowicz has announced the departure from politics.
At the end of the term, it has an amount of 110 thousand PLN

Pavlowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and a little smaller, which he rents, taking PLN 880 per month.

Previously, Jarosław Kaczyński published the property statement.
Voting for a break at the Conservative Party Conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons at the annual Conservative Party program conference, which the government asked for.
There were 289 deputies, against 306.
Usually, the House of Commons does not hold parties during the conferences, so that Members do not have to give up either participation or parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, in such a crucial time as are the last weeks before the UK’s planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
The government's request for a break was expressed by 289 MPs, against 306.
Two opposition parties after the convention
Lack of consent to a break may be accepted as a political revenge of opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was deemed unlawful and unexplored by the Supreme Court) and for failing to apologize for it after the ruling of the judges.
After that ruling, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s speech and the subsequent turbulent debate.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time for Brexit.
It needs to be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on the priorities of citizens, on health care, on the costs of life.
“Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups - the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats - have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson gave, explaining such a long suspension of parliament, was just party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media said.
The president’s spokesman has deplored these reports.
“It’s just not true,” Błaże Spychalski tweeted.
The Israeli media, among others: \"Haaretz - and \"Jerusalem Post - citing the Jewish Insider - write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in New York, declared that Israel is guilty of recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israel’s Foreign Minister Katz, who said in February that “Pola have eroded anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he was sorry that Israel did not apologize for the defamatory statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the actions of aggression against the ambassador of Poland in Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, “Polak, the Pole.”
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
That’s simply not true,” Błaże Spychalski tweeted.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel is responsible for recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalski, the portal “invented this,”
According to the spokesmans, \"JI - during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivors, awarded with the Commander's Cross of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda’s words and say that it was Jews from Israel “as Israel Kac” who are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, Mosberg’s statement was to be discontinued.
Who is Banas and what is he responsible for?
Rented by souvenirs, the tenement house led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia’s property statements.
We're summarizing another affair that shook the ruling camp.
Supervisioners revealed that Marian Banas, President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered a 400-meter-old building in the last few years, which is located in Podgórz, Krakow.
Moreover, its tenant had to drive in the mentioned tenement sex business (so rent rooms for hours).
On the other hand, the building itself was allegedly a guarantee of repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel’s “Supervisioner” program
The journalist revealed that from Banasia the tenement house was rented by people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic meetings.”
The clients were to be men using prostitute services.
Banas's allegations were unsightly and confusing.
Interestingly, the househouse rented by the souvenirs led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia’s property statements.
The building itself was described in a vague way, and the income from its rental was to be reduced.
“The mother of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth 6 to 8 million zlotys.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...] - writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia building itself was worth about 3 million zlotys.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently in control of Mariana Banasia’s property statements for 2015-2019.
Banas announced that he would suspend his activities in NIK until she was finished. “I will speak to you of a free march,” he said.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We don’t hear CBA extending its investigation or speeding up the investigation of Marian Banasia’s property statements.
That is why we are forced to inform the authorities of the state and to notify them of the possibility of committing the crime,” said Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole so deeply valued the rent of his property, he would already have 10 controls, a tax measure, and a tax group’s conduct,” he added.
He went high, he fell low.
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a six-year term.
His candidacy was reported by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party adopted.
Previously Banas was associated with NIK between 1992 and 2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first reign of PiS (2005 to 2008), Banas held the position of the President of the Customs Service and, moreover, the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has sat back at the chair of the head of the Customs Service and since 2017 managed the National Tax Administration.
Banas served for three months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.

← “To ignore the police command will be punished”
According to the newspaper, disregarding a specific behavior order issued by a police officer is intended to be a new type of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
These changes are required by the police union.
The idea came to the Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because more than half a million cases of crime are being brought to Polish courts every year,” he said.
\"The Rzeczpospolita - found that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police officers writes to MEPs on the change of the code of offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners shall propose a new text of Article 54a of the Code of Infringement.
“Whoever does not submit to the request or command of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, is subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty”
“Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who do not perform orders will prevent or hinder the performance of the service,” the daily said.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said: \"The Republic of Poland - that although it agrees with the main message of the draft provision, it is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be used in political matters of manifestation.
“In situations of freedom demonstration, this would be unfavorable and rather than mitigate the situation, even to exacerbate it,” he adds.
According to statistics from the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month, services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
I have Topol writing in my blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
So, from the beginning, over Jáchym hung the curse of talent, which he was trying to use.
After eight years, he returned with a “sensitive man.”
The heroes are Buras and Soňa, together with two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They are traveling actors, travelling around Europe.
He's a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she's a one-eye translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys since birth did not make a sound out of himself, and for the second time he stopped in infant times.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
Everyone is just a background to observe a world where there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It is a world of clogged provinces, old society, suspicious people and solved youth.
\"A sensitive man - places turn into an absurd theater.
The narrative imitates didascalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is Europe full of concerns about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although British travel agency Thomas Cook fell, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann functions.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines said it would cancel 105 flights in October due to bankruptcy problems with Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The Gandava court also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Today, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook, Belgium Leen Segers, said the company was “fully operational, despite the announcement of bankruptcy by a British mother company that caused anxiety among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that customers who bought out trips would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world, announced its bankruptcy on Sunday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse of last chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
Creditors demanded that, in addition to the €900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company obtain an additional £200 million as a winter security when travel agencies usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company’s problems have increased for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an unusual offer was prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
The actions are designed to help combat the progressive decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is Germany’s most advanced city.
A beautiful pastel old woman attracts 140,000 tourists every year.
As the Guardian says, “The city is struggling with significant problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also struggles with a constant decline in the number of inhabitants.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left the west of the country, which turned into a drop in the city population by 25%.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
In order to combat the population, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as the program was concerned, 150 applications were submitted.
Two-thirds of them were composed by the inhabitants of large cities.
The programme also involved people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
“When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Görlitz,” one of the project participants said.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city’s authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinions of the participants.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires will help to revive smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas for attracting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a pay programme to promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in U.S. Tulsa, Oklahoma.
