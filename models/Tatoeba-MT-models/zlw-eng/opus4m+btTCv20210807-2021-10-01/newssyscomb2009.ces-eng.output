The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, combined, has 29%
The visible weakening of both sides of the existing major coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties brought the first preliminary results of Sunday’s early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molter has been seriously shaked.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korutan chief Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8% of votes, but 5.5% of votes are lost against the last elections in 2006.
ÖVP lost 25.6 percent of its votes.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially in the people who have produced an early election, literally a disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a significant lead in their preferences before the SPÖ.
The voters, however, apparently were punished for letting the government fall.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation on the possible resignation of the party’s president and the previous vice-president Wilhelm Molterer was already heard.
The observers consider that this could be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party’s Presidency.
Such a development would seem to facilitate the way to the ever-probable exit from the election outcome, i.e. to the restoration of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
Due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) gained a preliminary 18% and BZÖ 11% of the votes - but at the same time, the Social Democrats expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the people agreed with the populist (then the FPÖ was uniform, in 2005 it split off from the BZÖ) to the common government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to Vienna for national politics, is obviously betting on this development.
The Green Party, which was easily lost and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other parties clearly exceeded the 4% border and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India May Cool
If we could not solve the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting brooches in India, Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
“If it didn’t work out, then yes, there would be some cooling,” he said after a meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that the executive power could be difficult to interfere with.
However, he said that in the case of Peter Švácha, who was released from charges and punished by fines, the central government can act with the local government in Dardžiling, the jurisdiction of which the case falls.
\"His problem could be solved,\" the minister said.
For Emil Kučera sentenced to three flights to prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for release on bail and wait for the sentence at liberty, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken at the meeting.
“It recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon it,” the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can enter the matter is to provide the convicted - competent legal support, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided by the Indian side.
We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We consider it a real mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
The answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side to deal with things was avoided by the minister.
“I’ve received quite a lot of promises,” he said.
Czechs judge the fight for seabed
A wall electronic map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of the United Nations Ocean and Sea Law Division.
His boss, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally complements.
There is work elan and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far hidden a little known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other minerals can be found here, but also unknown living organisms that have the key to developing a cancer medicine.
The bottom greater than the mainland
Coastal states have now begun to apply for a new submarine territory vehemently.
Under the UN Convention, they used their rights as agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It is exclusively entitled to all sources of the continental shelf.
“In simple terms, the continental shelf has the part of the seabed and its base, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond two hundred naval miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far,” adds Mikulka.
World feedback has recently seen Australia’s success, which has been the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions.
But New Zealand also gained the area of the seabed, which the Commission granted it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Millions of dollars were invested in the survey.
The profit that will flow from the use of the seabed in the future will be invaluable, as they promise.
Other countries will gradually submit their requests.
They can do so up to ten years after they have ratified the Montego Bay treaty.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, the convention declared \"the common heritage of humanity\"
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of mining in this area is conferred by the Convention established by an international institution.
“The seabed is not a Klondik,” says Mikulka’s director, adding that his “single areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually enshrined.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the common organization-Interoceanmetal-
In 1991, it acquired the status of a “powder investor”, as well as the investors of a few other countries.
It is authorised to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The investor of the research area is slightly larger than that of former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken down, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
It can be mined on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich find of polymetal concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Rober Sandev division brings one such concrete to the sample.
It reminds of a small potato or, with a little fantasy, a fairy-tale-tale-tale-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tied-tree-tree-tree-tree-tree-tied-tree-tree-tied-tree-tied-tree-tree-tree-tied-tree-tree-tied-tree-tree-tied-tied-tree-tied-tied-tree-tread-tied-tree-tree-t.
The German Special Forces were in the liberation of hostages.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the crisis, experts have come.
When the situation escalated, special units were ready, but there was no deployment.
Further details of the circumstances of the emancipation of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are gradually received by the public.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action, according to the Ministry of Defence and Interior.
According to the Ministry’s statements, both the Federal Army and the anti-terrorist group members of the German police GSG9, the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also the logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the site.
However, according to a further statement by the spokespersons of the two ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces did not need to, because the hijackers had let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government said it accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the action on the spot.
“Fortunately,” said one of the spokespersons of the Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travellers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight Egyptian guides on September 19th in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in the desert area in southern Egypt, hostages moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the liberation or possible payment of the ransom.
They are now safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the liberation of hostages was in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, information is not yet available when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to a letter from Bild, all five tourists should also fly with special forces from one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejected Rescue Package
The first U.S. Congressional Chamber had a bailout of $700 billion for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones index has suddenly fallen.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and the leaders of both sides, for a program that should ease the chaos in financial markets, most have not been found.
The protesters desperately tried to criticize a $700 billion package.
Mr Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the MP's vote to give his consent, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the investor’s concerns that the state rescue package could fall.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index increased, so that after the notification of the failure of the package, the tree fell again.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulents in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to agree with the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents record increasing number of reservations
Winter seems to be good for German businessmen in tourism:
According to one study, travel bookings for the next month increased significantly compared to the previous year - more than 30 percent during the winter season.
Despite the weak economic growth, the German’s desire to travel remains unbroken.
For the winter season reservations, travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, according to the German Tourism Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already increased number of reservations available for autumn months.
Thus, the turnover was about 11% higher compared to 2007 according to the DRV.
The basis for these results is GfK numbers, which each month evaluates the booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included travel bookings that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak rate of the dollar, mainly trips to the US are requested, the DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in reservations is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece are particularly desirable targets for the Germans, as well as domestic waters.
First of all, organized tours are in the course, said DRV Chairman Klaus Laepple.
With regard to the increasing expenditure on energy and food, costs are easier for the client than for individually organised holidays.
Laepple explained that money can save consumers, among other things, by making use of discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, it was said that the number of reservations was very good, so there will be a higher turnover again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Infinitely repeated pop, beer made of tulips and prominents in cuts from well-known designers.
For the first time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a television moderator, and she's wearing a tailor-made cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we are not even three minutes on a beer meadow, and already photographers and absolutely fill the memory cards - I am proud of it, for I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems that my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I am here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the cut was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's cut or leather pants; no one looks distasteful or embarrassingly affected - everything is completely normal.
A special look at the stand with bananas in chocolate only harvests my cover.
One Munich woman warns me that I have made a wrong commitment to her: ‘You are free, in the middle of the virgin, on the right, in the back of the widow’
I'm going to throw my ass to the left.
“Good,” he said, laughing.
Others don’t care so much about subtle flirting techniques and they wear simple felt hats with the inscription ‘To Drunk to Get Dressed’ and print on the passing naked butts.
A young man with such tendencies is called Bob, he is from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
It appears to be ‘gorgious’ with an extended oo
That's what I'm told after you've relieved me of your just-drunk mazo.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks they're trash bins.
Bob is, therefore, one of the fearful “Wildbieslers”, as it is said in Bavaria, in public.
The others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, the Oktoberfest is run, and the health caregivers have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Health caregivers always appear in herds - in four she wears covered stretches from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to beer meadows: empty there, full back again.
Whoever lies under the sail of this coffin from the bleaks, is not seen.
“They’re the ones that can’t go on,” one of the medical professionals called me in response to my question and disappeared in the crowd.
Police have published the name of the victim of the accident
The name was published for a 36-year-old woman who died in a hospital after a car crashed in Essex.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon struck Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of a careless ride.
He was released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, the European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish agenda.
On the east bank of Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpaša Railway Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-renaissance style.
This is what the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platform with a tower on each corner of the front, looking at the disrecognition from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a man gets in the arched treasure, he can no longer have doubts about the size of the enterprise whose most western gate the station was.
The station opened the German consortium of Anatolia-Bagdad corporation in August 1908.
Germany, which was later involved in the game of empires, intended to pursue its ambition to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
The British and colonial troops proceeded from Egypt and pushed out the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpasa station, too.
In 1917, an explosion of a ammunition train destroyed its sophisticated roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually drooping around history.
However, today this gate to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is getting involved.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was supposed to meet one of the leading experts of the AKP, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about 10 and a half hours later - after a collaring ride on tracks that reminded of the old world rhythms of the famous Night Mail document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, presents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the West, she raised suspicions, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main tent of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on the developing suburbs, surrounded by half-built department stores and warehouses for power, where middle managers in business clothes - men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kinklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Sako, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
The purpose of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
“The cold war was an anomaly,” he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its preoccupation.
Today, we have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
“But there will certainly be moments,” I asked, “when Turkey may have to decide”
“Turkey,” he said, “didn’t want such a decision to be made,”
After that, he stressed what almost everyone I spoke with said: Turkey’s relations with not only the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are equally for the benefit of Europe and the United States as well as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go on these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša station, after another mostly late night, I thought of the two German Mr. Herr Ritter and Herr Cona who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
As they would have been surprised if they had found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting in port for a ferry back through Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called a “sick man of Europe”...
So it seems that at least then there were not many doubts which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Featured Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: “As Guildford’s music leader since 1962, Vernon-Tod-Handley (necrologue, September 11) was in charge of Guildford’s Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district musical plan, he founded a year for this excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be up to 21 years old, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, there were a few of us almost 30 - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name Proteus (mythological shape converter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to enter any music presented to it - whether madrigala or Messiaen, whether alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptive created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Todd tell us to “let music speak for itself”?
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it!
His tactile technique was quite clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor mayy.
Wherever the music standard was, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be matched to a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply “pulled one or two cracks around the world”
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) claims that in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA, and PhD.
This is based on Woodruff's note by the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina-Flamenco and Life - because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They caught me with the simplicity and powerful charge with which the audience works, and with respect and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of affection.
Resino can capture magical moments.
Honda to attack her bestseller for the second time
In November, Honda will launch sales of the second generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle has already had a significant space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, from an aesthetic point of view, the new Jazz lines are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this one-space car.
For example, it is necessary to mention innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
The first thing we will notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less well-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year’s 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million units have been sold since Honda Jazz was launched.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 estimates count on 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch’s management expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
The company’s management expects de facto to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expected to reach 2%.
To achieve this, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
Honda Insight is a five-door hybrid of compact size with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, according to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will split the old continent and Japan.
The launch of Honda Insight sales is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions have increased in the new Jazz.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axle layout to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the contrary, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The internal space was also enlarged by increasing its dimensions.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing a fuel tank in the middle of a car already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased to up to 399 liters, by 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage compartment volume at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the ability to equip with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow the opening angle of 80 degrees versus 67 for the first Jazz.
In the second generation of Honda Jazz, engines are also new.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the drive system at the same time as high torque in full engine speeds.
The first 1.2-liter engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 speeds.
This engine, which had 78 horses for the previous generation of Jazz, has 5.3 liters of consumption and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
Auto Bees - Prevents precipitation
This time, Nissan was inspired in nature, specifically by bees, to progress in the development of technologies that protect against accidents.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the model of flying bees to prevent collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Robotics Center have developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technology Research at the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, CEO of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of Nissan security shield.
The robot is tasked with strengthening the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are folded bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
Engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to two meters in the 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which converts it immediately to a collision warning.
When an obstacle is recorded, the robot imitates the bee movements and immediately turns the wheel to the right or even greater angle to prevent collisions.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that all the flexible maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
The robot, unlike the bee, cannot move upwards and downs or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to a direction that is allowed by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and options as in the bee.
In addition to acceleration and slowdown, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent collisions.
The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and according to this data to be maintained.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can function without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about giga or mega.
This is the first step in the development of new instant precipitation prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts for use in series cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to integrate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would bring the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy fear before taking a mortgage
It should be recognised that the U.S. Department of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to give away injections, lacks even ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at banks with dubious solvency, Bad Credit Hotel has created a popular-teaching game online.
Or “Hotel of bad credit” or a confused hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look gloomy to make one once, twice and three times wonder if the right moment is to ask for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
This site is more suitable for young people than space for the general public.
What happens when the game ends?
A dream room will appear inside the hotel.
At least something, because you'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens MUFG's capital
Morgan Stanley reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, would spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital.
A week after they revealed their preliminary deal, the two banks explained that MUFG plans to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s current shares at a single price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of securities as of 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in the acquisition of convertable securities, which will provide 10% of its yield and the exchange price of which is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the operation would take place based on an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares lost 6.79% and got to $23.07 around 17.00 greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of this American group.
The new statute was adopted last week by Morgan Stanley, which is intended to allow him to vary his activities, but at the same time it is under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest ace from Wall Street to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been modified over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“We thought a week ago,” said Tokiu Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG CEO, “that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to reduce risks to a minimum and also to cover up -
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for Morgan Stanley’s securities than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction of profit from the share by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter will be exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e. for approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and raise his cash.
However, the group spokesperson refused to provide details on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should boast of Tier One’s paymentworthiness ratio of around 15%, one of the industry’s best.
Morgan said that since the end of August, he has been cutting his balance.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has fallen by half, while insurance costs against the risk of default associated with debt have increased sharply.
On Monday, these costs were reversed, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other survivors, announced from Wall Street's major investment banks following the fall of Bear Stearns and the Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, took $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-founding the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuela Hugo Chavez, Bolivia’s Eva Morales and Ecuador’s Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed to vote, following the model of his counterparts and friends, proposed a new constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted in a referendum.
-No - according to these results 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the voting tickets were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, he had to get half of the votes plus one.
The two polls conducted at the exit of the electoral rooms and the calculation of NGOs predicted a clear victory on Sunday - yes - with between 63% and 70% of them.
Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft constitution from Sunday to Monday.
“The establishment has won the entire line,” he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil governorship headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the U.S. Organization of States (OEA), took place in peace, concerned a text of 444 points building new socialism - promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over economics by securing it \"planning for development\" - a country that lives mainly from oil mining by foreign companies and foreign exchange, which is sent by its immigrants.
The proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state who will be able to execute two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, consolidates the principle of free health care and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with a population of 13.9 million, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, the ban on foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of Ecuadorian base as the starting point of U.S. drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian commando took 11 tourists and their eight-member escorts who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were alive on Monday and brought to Egypt’s capital.
During the morning, Egyptian commanders were liberated from Chad.
The hostages flew around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, closely adjacent to the Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without being able to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo's marginal residential district, to undergo medical examinations there.
“They are completely healthy and no ransom has been paid to the hijackers,” Egypt’s tourism minister Zohejr Garrana said on a trip to the airport.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been pulled from one shelter to the other by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of Aegyptus, a safari organizer.
A senior Egyptian security officer suggested that 30 members of special units who approached the site on board two helicopters set off on a stand during the night just before dawn.
“There was a shooting, half of the hijackers were killed and others fled,” said the source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces from the Flash unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
Italian diplomatic chief Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of the Italian Special Forces.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of people from our secret services, from special forces,” he said without further clarification.
He also denied that a ransom would be paid.
On the eve of last week, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle on board the hijackers, killing six of them, including a Chad commander, and arresting two.
The military claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Dárpur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - The silent majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with fingertips and is a topic of the current election campaign.
The better.
But one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to launder the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memorable places that die of hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they will forget their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Québek, as in Canada, we don’t have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is donating three and a half million euros to the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Québek, in the Québek History Society Federation, at least 40,000 volunteers are committed to 211 societies for history, monuments, archives, and genealogy to uncover history, preserve a pile of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, which are driven by hopeless protests when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers into old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally get to the Tribune for History and Monuments?
Benelux Governments State of Fortis Bank
Benelux countries will be helped by the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank, which has been the first to get into trouble in Europe due to the spreading effect of the U.S. mortgage crisis, a partial state: three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to €11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch government this weekend, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area that has been in crisis in international financial markets, spread in waves for over a year, into a major crisis, and the decisions made in this case could, from a certain point of view, be seen as precedents.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy out almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
The bank will certainly sell part of its capital shares, especially the insurance company, the activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis shares began to decline sharply last week, and in the second half of the week serious signs of the crisis appeared already in the constitution.
Analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company’s securities fell by only 12% on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Due to current stock prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to the company’s leaders.
The company’s management is responsible for the downfall of Fortis’s overseas market uncertainty over the adoption of a $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, the shares rose slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet signed up.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors don’t have to worry, they won’t lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the branches have not been prevented from attacking.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
A fox in a chicken tree
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on data from people about the purchase of medicines, often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
There is a data protection programme that binds the use of drug prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust chicken foxes,” says Richard Dick, author of the program for monitoring prescriptions.
The insurance company shall make the insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health status of the interested parties, and if the risk is assessed as too large, they shall not even close the insurance with it.
They had previously been sent to the medical examinations concerned and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on an identification number, the pharmacies will easily find out what medicines he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself leads out, how he suffers from the disease and what his health is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to having virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts it in a category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also determine the risk coefficient, so that there is almost no work left in the insurance company besides paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
Disadvantages include that many drugs can be used for several purposes, some compounds are used against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these pose a significant risk-increasing factor, although the first-named difficulties are not.
In order to request and process data, special companies were created, which, before they could obtain the necessary information from pharmacies, ask the patient for permission.
They are now forced to do so, even though they have not been punished for their past negligence.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory tests that link data on medicines that can provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies have access to the data, while at the same time controlling their use will become increasingly complex.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The draft law, which gives the authorities the authority to control also companies specializing in the provision of data, is in front of Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his program in such a way that the data transmission is bound to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can hardly refuse the consent in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are just a little bit referred to to the fox's goodwill.
The Global Marseille Menu
EU and India to double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are among the leading business partners, this issue has led, alongside other, mainly global problems, also the agenda of the ninth meeting at the highest level.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today, which will be mainly about cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power, which should be given more opportunity to speak on international issues, but has not yet managed to find a common denominator for Member States in support of the permanent membership of the New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not further discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, or President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or to increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods has increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
As a sign of this, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been aligned from a legal point of view, so green has also been given to air transport in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance balance while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is ranked 9th among EU partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, has been condemned by both sides in all its forms and called for the rapid convocation of the UN conference.
They also made an end to the Doha business round, although they both had a large share of his failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the need to conclude a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050 at the climate conference next year.
Both sides would also like to prevent increased food prices and encourage the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
India’s prime minister is arriving in the French capital today, where he plans to close a trade on peaceful use of atomic energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that 20 billion euros of Indian nuclear reactors will be awarded to French companies.
According to the Agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers in the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171.790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorable guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Puno Italia) - on 264 square meters of exhibition area.
There will be a meeting with the press in the Buchmesse Room in Pavilion 5.0: this will be an opportunity to show figures, trends and perspectives regarding the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors’ books in relation to total Italian production continues to decrease, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying the desert in Nevada.
The ruins were discovered at a high altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sir Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madeira County, John Anderson, has raised doubts that still remained: “The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly where Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The Sheriff said that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (Ntsb) said several hours after the detection of the wreckage, an investigation team that eventually identified the plane was sent: it was exactly the Bellancu 8kcab, missing from 3 September 2007, when Fossett flew from Yerington, Nevada to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fossett's personal items were found one couple close to their dwellings in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, money in cash and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of priorities.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world on the plane and without landing.
His many records also include a flight of 15.445 meters above the Andes, although with a dome.
Glk, an advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the “compact” jeeps of the star house, through which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the vortex of news into this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional communication, which will accompany the launch of Suv Glk and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of a new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial way of communicating thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the automotive brand.
The maxi poster project, broken down into three different stages, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of a car in stereoscopic vision and with special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real size and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated at various moments in all its small things, so that it will be re-assembled in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he be able to raise the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
We know who the Italians are.
Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the Ultras Italia group that has been following Nazionale azzurra for years, and who has never, to the truth, ever caused excessive problems.
She never even met the fans of the opponent.
Group orientation is right-wing.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags, where the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they have been removed so that they are not recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
They found true Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc has made it available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all on the name, i.e. easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasl, no one to whom it would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous stadium offences were denied a ticket and a game banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the news coming from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to put Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified during the upheaval.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, in short, won't go to any more stadiums.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulsification: that is, more than one hundred and fifty are added to those.
“We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who behave in this way,” they confirm from Viminal.
So, “rightly open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Leč”
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Osservatorio will meet tomorrow, on Tuesday Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the stadium problems.
“Church leaders-leaders and tight arms during Mameli’s anthem? It’s not a crime in Bulgaria.”
This is the idea of Domenic Mazzilli (expressed in a very poor way), who is the director of the Viminal Osservatorium (he won a place that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where the core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but, of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
“I’m not a sociologist,” says Osservator, “the crimes are attributed to the country in which they have become.
So far this group has remained within limits, now we will look closely at what has happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the starring at Mameli’s anthem: neither is it a crime, but if you allow it, it’s a lack of education.”
