The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a negative at the end of the trade
After the early fall of the Prague Stock Exchange, the losses were corrected.
The transactions with the June stock reached almost half of the day-to-day trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange started trading on its Monday as it fell by almost 6 percent.
This time, there is a fall in shares on Wall Street.
We also have a market response to the result of a vote by the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support the Stabilisation Plan of the financial sector.
Fall of actions in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday experienced stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes eventually deleted some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng exchange index in Hong Kong dropped nearly four percent during trading, but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually lost to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the US rescue event is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s monetary office.
Hong Kong, although part of China, has determined monetary policy itself, regardless of the central bank of China.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should return quickly to negotiations and a proposal to support the financial system.
It is said that other countries will feel the impact.
The Blood Spa of U.S. Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion CZK).
The legislators ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a bloody bath, and major stock indexes have seen the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7 percent and the decline to a similar extent last recorded in 1987.
The index declined before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the House had not passed, the index was in free fall.
U.S. Government Can Pump $700 Billion to Bank
U.S. Congressional chiefs and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks about the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the U.S. financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, the winning is not yet.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The financial system support plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, he told Reuters the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Barney Frank.
According to sources, the Senate may first vote on the plan on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a “restraint”, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, what help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We made great progress.
We have resolved our differences in terms of how the package should look like to stabilize the market,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrats official at Bloomberg.
The final vote could take place on Sunday.
The lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy off non-sale mortgage assets from financial companies that pull financial firms into severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive plan agreement that will work and must also be effective on the market.
“We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to New York’s Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is why they want to calm investors down before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress’s decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, or whether they can't be held at the last minute.
The lawmakers hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still make a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the aid scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be available as soon as possible as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not performing its function, in line with an additional $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush Recognizes Progress in Negotiations
The president may veto this decision, but Congress may vote for it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain funds to buy back bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has been preserved.
“We’ve done everything.
“The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was happy with Saturday's progress and appreciated - a supportive effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy -
Restricting the Golden Drowsers
Chairman Christopher Dodd, head of the board of directors, said the legislators agreed to be responsible for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing reliefs, timing of financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called gold parachutes for the director of the company participating in the program and to establish a committee that will have overseen the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve been working very hard on it, and we’ve made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful to the market and all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts with help for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments for mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly costs of repayments for debtors and allow them to retain their homes.
Mark: Psychological aid
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the chief economist Patrio Finance David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement it.
This is because it is not known what mechanisms and at what price the problem assets will be bought out.
This is going to be crucial for how the financial sector and government will divide their losses,” Marek said.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important, according to Mark.
“It is much more important for Congressmen to agree this week to support this plan and to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is at the moment the most important,” said Mark.
Fight on the edge of the knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
Of that, it seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the demands of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a top-notch turntable home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
However, such music products on LP boards do not come out and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you are tight in your shelves vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a turntable at least.
The same is true of music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for the player, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd, he may find it difficult to try the headphones for 20 crowns from the marketplace.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also determined.
Some top music players can do much more than just playing music, but what most mobiles don’t even happen.
No current device is as versatile as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone and esemesque, he can play music and video, record both, have a better camera, and maybe even navigate.
And when we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, no refrigerator can grill and no TV photographes anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the display indicator sends you to the charger.
Playing music is one of the biggest energy sources.
Few mobiles can play music for more than 10 hours, most of which are much less.
In this respect, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For low-cost mobile phones, count on them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the worst will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, and not each of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card reader can handle the miniature memory cards that are used on mobiles without reducing.
For players except for exceptions (iPod) you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobiles and players already create a music library by name, album name, genre, or user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Windows Explorer, and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles can do more
When choosing a particular device, be especially interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and audio output type and, of course, control comfort.
If you listen to music on a tram every day, you just need to have any mobile phone playing MP3.
This is what almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t have to watch too much what music formats a mobile or player can play.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and in addition to it, the vast majority of instruments can also handle WMA music.
Less is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the respective website of the operator (or other provider) and buy a song or album.
This service itself could already be a good argument for getting a music cell phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited to fast-leaved radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this method of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) will be mastered by the music industry in the future.
Most people carry a cell phone with them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you will catch your mobile phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones with you or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be for many prices.
The cheapest ones are normally below three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already acquire a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones with a 3.5 mm hole for regular headphones cost up to 15 thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - the player can really control everyone.
The minimum function, similarity of control with a previous regular cartridge or, for example, a turntable is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an error-on mobile internet and then a giant data transfer account.
What instrument to reach
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you’re a more demanding listener, you’d better reach for specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus approaching a separate MP3 player.
It’s farthest from Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman mobiles have the same user interface as the self-sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to CZK 4,000, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take MP3 players away from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classic ones to discount.
Maybe he won't be missing long.
About the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written many times on Mobil.cz.
Furthermore, the Czech Republic also confirmed that the price of SMS is higher than that of the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to go into battle.
It may sound paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration rate of over 100 percent.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to say that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvorák, who in the past expressed several times that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It’s probably true that a classic operator with its own network doesn’t seem to have a chance anymore (in other words, it would hardly have been looking for a frequency).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which classical operators had to respond.
Even before Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, there were similar voices in the UK.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, more than 100,000 customers managed to get this operator and become the fifth-largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators tend to be low-cost, offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and a bet on an untapped target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
“Administrative men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could be caught with us.
Vodafone press spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for segmental access, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings.
In the Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Rather, there will be the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studničková, a press spokesman for the financial group Penta in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to do so.
Rather, it tries to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For a long time, the GTS Novera group has not been hiding in the interest of launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor of the O2 Telephony in the field of corporate customers.
We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a press spokesperson.
Maybe it’s going to be better times.
From unofficial information, the first virtual operator seems to be expected by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
At this point, we do not think that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area,” Vlastimil Srseň, of the Press Department Telephonics O2, said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Press spokesperson Martina Kemrová supplies in rare agreement with the statement O2: “We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build more”
He adds: “It’s hard for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would already have had a specific deal on the table in order to be able to think in this short term -
Vodafone vampires its attention to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “By negotiating with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider the most beneficial in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for building a shared network for fast mobile internet -
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to operators, they are able to pull a rope behind it, also testifies to the drag around the formation of U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the Czech Republic was at the time of U:fone’s formation from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
Now, however, U:fon is useful as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would impose high demands on him and, above all, on his services -
Due to this approach, mobile operators are directly striking the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only a question of the position of ČTÚ, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (UOHS).
However, he took a typical stance on the whole issue.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators,” said Kristián Chalupa, of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
From the representatives of the operators thus formulated the statement will not be surprising.
The Office, which is to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market, is more than a serious one.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “Abroad, where virtual operators operate normally, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile phone services.”
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decline are not among the interests of the OHS.
In fact, shocking on the whole case is the touching combination of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence is offered entirely by itself.
Just like the very same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is certainly only a part of chance and a hard competitive struggle.
The Authority has not found signs of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so they do not have an adequate increased responsibility for their conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunications regulator,” said Chalupa.
Interpreting the dominant position on the market is one of the many disputed points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
In this market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - to create a virtual operator, it is always necessary to consent the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has quite logically - on its network monopoly.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not admit this argument, it should be at least warning that three mobile operators are progressing significantly similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera mentioned above) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
It is then a fairly usual trick in telecommunications that ÚOHS gives away from the whole matter.
We met him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of the CTU’s powers to competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
This must be more than good for the representatives of ÚOHS, but probably their interests are elsewhere.
This is when no one looks.
There are a number of pseudo-virtual operators in the Czech mobile network.
They are companies issuing their own mobile phone service prices, but they are only partially public.
It is usually a multi-level marketing company.
Our own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many more.
The prices of these companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic company customer ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, it will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a sale.
“If there were cases that you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the end of cooperation with the company,” Martina Kemrová said in a statement.
However, it is quite unlikely that a similar activity would not be brought to responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are prevented from doing this.
In fact, these companies have insignificant profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: “The law of similar speculation allows, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not kept by their name, so they cannot have it with it fully as ordinary customers of mobile operators -
But that should be at least weird.
In addition, another question opens for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators hold eyes on a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that OOHS has relatively strong powers to reveal similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no idea of anything like that and their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When we will not be the most expensive
As has already been the case several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
Jimi used arguments were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturized market, problems with service quality, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was in these moments that regulatory authorities, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers, struck.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and packed another with it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case like hot potatoes.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the ambiguity of competence in these cases is more than appropriate for them.
But let's not throw flint into a living.
If behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear in us, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult to be able to remain smooth to reject (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling the grooves than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech National Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem where my home.
Anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlovka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir submission and instrumental version.
The song was performed by Katerina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Belohlavek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had previously told Czech radio that he had deliberately chosen to sing solo variants of singers with young representative voices that are prominent and popular.
“From the very beginning, I tried to make sure that the congregation had a clear dictation so that the text could be understood well in order to conjure up,” he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the Stavov Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovaček Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously took her as theirs.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
What is a New Anthem?
Prague’s public transport will be driving on the chip for the first time on Wednesday.
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be entered into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and buses, which will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of the paper ticket.
At this point, you can buy about 100,000 people who own an Opencard chip card.
Travellers can purchase a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card in the info centers and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations of the Museum, Mostek, Railway Station Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Paradise Garden, Kacherov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought online from yesterday at the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the outlet window in metro stations, where they had to stay regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
The coupon will be purchased online and recorded on the Opencard card at one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places, there is a bar for passengers with trained staff to help those interested in online shopping and also upload a coupon purchased on their card,” said Martin Opatrný, a spokesperson for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, resembling ticket markers, and may have already been noticed by passengers in the metro stations Roztyly, Budejovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are five in the city now, but by the end of the year there should be 80 of them,” he added.
The coupon checks the driver's seat automat
The service of machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which is driven to the capital mainly by the inhabitants of Central Bohemia.
“In trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers to determine the time and zone validity of coupons,” explained Filip Drápal, a company that compiles the timetables of Prague’s public transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built in the cash register with the driver.
It is therefore necessary to show not only the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cashier.
This will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
“If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal added.
Passengers who do not drive by suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can return to self-service vending machines where coupons on the card are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the instrument display.
U.S. referendums
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the integration of the Sumava into the United States.
It is from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the president of the United States.
This follows, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In a letter from the President of the United States, the Germans of the Czech Republic ask that they do not allow the return of the Šumava County - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be sure that American troops come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “The people to whom the fate of the Sumava lies on the heart.”
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia is alleged to give Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, carelessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president to take over the Šumava Protectorate for present and eternal times.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign country that oppresses and refutes minorities and does nothing to contribute to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why authors cannot sign is reportedly the fear of the vengefulness of Czech oppressors.
If the U.S. president had reportedly doubted the idea of the Sumava Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Shumava County whether its residents wanted to become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive with the knowledge of postwar history today, according to some memoirs, it accurately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least know that it would be their removal from the republic, few of them had ever admitted such an option.
Some have expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Budejovice.
During the war, he was deployed to the Baltic Navy as Budejovice.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach Czech.
“They believed that when they came home, Czech would be useful,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, were expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of Benes' decrees.
Man, you're gonna pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
An emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday could be characterised.
The Office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage the driver from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to attach themselves before they leave.
He wants to reach the conscience especially for young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
Man, you're gonna pay!
The word “do not think” is written in capital letters on the Espese.
And there is a word in the pool of blood, \"you shall pay.\"
This is to symbolize that a person can pay ina moment of inattentiveness with his own life.
The audiences will be afraid of spots until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The spot was prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
The driver has a sugar and whip system.
Sugar for them is that when they go red, for example, it saves time.
A bull is a threat of a fine or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk,” says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Korán.
And that’s why information campaigns in the press are needed, and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist says.
He said that the boards that alert drivers to the dangers are less effective.
“If a static table is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and the drivers will not care about it,” Koran said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The interim president of the Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordania, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview with the Jediot Achronot newspaper on Monday.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert said.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to advance a similar percentage (Israeli land) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He admitted that the return would include East Jerusalem.
“He who wants safety in Jerusalem, and especially does not want his tractors or bulldozers to turn his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up some of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in a statement of two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mount, a sacred and historical site - which lies inside the Old Town.
“Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he added.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert has also spoken out for Israel’s departure from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some effort by Damascus.
“I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of the departure from Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (shiite movement); they will have to give up the lasting support provided by Hamas (shiite movement), al-Qaeda and jihad (holy war) in Iraq,” the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the Stevards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, it is not possible to walk on a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padova, the question arises as to whether the Stevards and passengers can travel by bus.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the operation of the Stevard is contrary to the Road Traffic Act,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week, a twenty-two-year-old Stevard was reportedly caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she was reserved two more seats.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the Stevard delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with a standing space according to the technical card.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency’s remote buses do not have space for standing; this is confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
“This was the case with the Ministry and the passenger movement was not allowed at first.
“Then we called it off, and we came to the point that passengers were allowed to go to the toilet if they had their seat,” he said.
The Stevard Law
There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of Stevard - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation nor prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the terms of the vehicle guide; its rights and obligations do not define,” says Hanzelka, a spokesperson.
On the contrary, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the issue of the law is being treated sufficiently.
It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in the approval.
That ends, he says.
Buses are divided into urban places where stand-ins and maximum speed are limited, intercity with stand-ins at higher permitted speeds and remotes without places to stand at the highest speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert.
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Hořín in the movement of Stevards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
“With smooth driving, many dangers do not threaten, the situation can be compared to service on aircraft.
Not even here is it certain when the turbulence comes and the stewardess can hit the head -
“If the bus is slowing down, of course, physical laws apply.
Just like on the city bus or tram.
Stevard safety must be addressed by carriers by internal regulations,” he says and also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
The Student Agency offers Stevard services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
As soon as I feel that the profession of Stevards is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers upon arrival.
It would also save costs, he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiany Alexey Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stevards in his cars.
“We don’t have Stevards, we’ve been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some sort of fatal injury,” he said less than a year ago for the week.
It has become an enormous tragedy.
In an accident of a line connection to Naples, a young Stevard from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died.
The Slovenian truck was likely to turn off without using a router from the stripe and lock the bus's way.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he introduced the right front of it.
That two places reserved for Stevard rest would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
These places cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked.
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With compensation from the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the Ortel court, but the financial compensation is also expected by the guilty.
Amendment of the law?
In the unsupervised
The specification of the movement of Stevards on board the bus could bring an adjustment to the law on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
No specific conclusion has been reached.
Buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile while driving,” says expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stevards to be a major threat to the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said.
Düsseldorf's hope is Frankfurt
The big words in the letter of the board of directors of WestLB are not lacking to the employees of this bank.
By linking the units of this düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt-Deka-Bank, the central institutions of the financial group will be saved for trading in capital markets, - we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a set of competences to this transaction, ensuring long-term returns.
It is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further association in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when the Board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deca-Bank, which customers are familiar with for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been spoken for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
In the presentation of the six-year results of the management at the end of August, Deca-Bank chief Franz Waas was told that he did not see any sense in the merger of his Mainzer Landstrasse banking house with any of the country's banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deca-Bank, which stands from one half of the Earth’s bank and from the other union, entrusted the Board of Directors with talks with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be trades in the capital market or part of it.
But the talks have just begun, the financiers are touching.
The Deca-Bank, which is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3,000 employees, is not mentioned for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the merger of Deca-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba could occur.
In the end, there was nothing in this three-party.
Shortly after the merger plans came to the public, the Hesse government spoke out against the participation of the Helaba Bank.
Neither the other banking houses were so connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart instead.
However, there have been repeated speculations about the connection between Deca-Bank and the Earth’s banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, has expressed negatively about the speculation of connecting his financial home to others.
However, it appears that independently of this, it considers that the approximation of different public sector banking houses is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Bavarian Earth Council, BayernLB’s connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could begin to be first.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it gradually loses potential partners for such connections.
In the south, only the second violin would play, even though the financial crisis has so far faced much better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In the beginning of the year, the Hessen-Thüringen Association of Savings and Chest Banks, which has a 50 percent stake in Helaba, banned the connection with WestLB.
This would be the most Nord LB.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind, however, are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model the future competitiveness of the earth’s banks should be ensured, the German Union saved and gill banks have not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the distribution of the WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the Board of Directors, he is also talking about trying to “complex solutions” for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the individual folders with Deca-Bank will show the time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the “Weekend with Italy”
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luc the third or the fourth.
But this time Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, so he says everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre Kaiser barrel, there is a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest prove how deep the tones can release its throat.
Elena Luca's gonna crack first, and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, four buses with the designation ‘destinazione Monaco, festa della birra’ are expected to arrive at 6.30 this evening.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, on one bus only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italy.
Marcovi, wearing a long coat with a fur-like lining and glasses with wide silver rings, the three buses belong.
He has been driving with them at Oktoberfest for five years, and this year he has only organized three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 22.30, go back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The journey costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Law on Beer Purity, Health Insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go into the night, after the highway towards 'Brennero'
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus shuts down quickly, the passengers sleep.
They do well, they still need their powers.
It is located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on highway 8 a.m. in front of Munich there is another break and a lot of other buses with the Italian brand.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at mid-seventh in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and others are gathering, Marco has his last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First of all, wear a yellow hat.
On the left side is written \"Oktoberfest\" next to Marcova's travel agency: -conoscersiviaggiando.it
“When the door opens into a beer tent, run,” Marco calls into the morning air.
Run and take seats at the back of the tent.
Not forward, so that you do not interfere, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, spread around the space -
Maze costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the propitious ones.
Show your friends that we behave well.
When you leave your places, they are gone.
“Tonight, exactly at midnight, be here again, do you understand?”
And up to Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
On the way one member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, signs and even election posters of one big Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As a weekend with Italy, the second weekend of Oktoberfest is known.
Accurate data on the number of visitors is not available; there are 50,000 people who go on a trip through the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors said this weekend arrived from Italy.
A number of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics in which the Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Especially popular with Italians tent Hofbräu.
Sleepless Nights for Mortgages of Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is a good thing that he used the word ‘relatively’ and included in his claim the fact that the German banking sector will not be saved from the crisis.
It was last weekend.
With the Dax Index, a monitored financial house specializing in the financing of real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion-billion-dollar loan from the consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulents.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that credit assistance would go up to €35 billion.
Interests will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from a really exhausted amount.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary of Depfa.
This state financier, according to a newspaper report, has been refinanced extremely short-term for long-term projects for which he borrowed money, which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve fell by 95% to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current revenues and net revenue from financial trades fell to zero from last year, revenues from increased debt value and from certain securities and also from the cancellation of credit trading reserves fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher returns on subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and on interest compensation under the Tax Code and for the brokerage of trade for the companies was the 16% decrease on the income side still moderated.
The former state financier, after its privatization in 1990, burned on mortgages for tradesmen, which were then separated from the service portfolio and further led by the Aareal Bank.
Since the classical state funding earned too little, Depfa was more strongly involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private investors and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and has diversified internationally.
From the value of their subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write down something, and these depreciations will have a “essential material effect” to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been indeterminately heard.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It has been reduced by two-thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since Depha took over.
More strongly than any other institution depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the U.S. investment bank, the bank’s bank’s banks virtually dried up two weeks ago, as banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs €50 billion per year for part of the Depf credit portfolio - short-term refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the group’s financial need for this loan is covered for an extended period of time and the company is protected from the influence of international money markets currently largely incapacitated functions.
Other sources have been heard that this money ensures refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervisory (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
This is what shareholders and bank creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and imperceptibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank stood before insolvency on Sunday afternoon, it cannot, although preliminary, save the passion.
The stock exchange rate fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond rates were well held.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, they lose secondary bond rates more significantly.
This concerns mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically the bonds with the maturity after 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo-Real-Estate initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood, depending on the stability of the international financial system, after a significant focus of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and the less affected trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity.
But there can also be something that almost no one can hope for - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, given the news coming at the same time with this partial stateization, only legitimate hope has now become likely to be bordered with certainty.
This is likely to prepare for long-term creditors a number of nights, when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the limit line to at least create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange returns of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and Secret Box Bento
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltropová is introduced to the high school in Tačibana, the girls begin to savor: the German is completely ‘kawaii’!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang. In her new blog about exchange stay, she tells about Japan.
First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already out of my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train in high school in Tačibana.
I had to find my way on my own, fortunately, I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching at Tačibana is not given as strictly as at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after 8 a.m. and 20 minutes before 9 a.m. begins a short session with a teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I should have introduced myself.
I am not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've taken on my old mother's dress, a blouse, blue stockings, and black leather shoes.
So I stood up in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajonara Wo She Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have my birthday in a week.
At that point, I was very glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were banging, chichotalo and waving, and I always heard the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my mang.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cut, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
The girl, next to me, smiled a lot, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when he heard gong, I was literally stunned.
They spoke one by one and chichotaly and asked me about the possible and impossible - and it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then they all packed their benta.
My host mother also made me such a lunch box - and that's something other than a boring German snack.
I had rice with herbs, small steamers, a salad of cucumbers and eyelashes, fruits and a kind of fish in a tofu dough.
I don’t know what I’m eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, except for the salt-loaded plums, br!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl will give the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes that he will know the boy closer to the break at the snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I’ve been reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comic books and their culture, I started learning Japanese once.
So it was quite clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs, and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen.
Even the rats have feelings.
When rats or cockroaches run away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how could it be possible to verify whether they feel the same when they behave the same way we do?
In the online magazine Edge, the contributions of well-known scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question “What do you think is true without you being able to prove it”
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove if we can’t prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to address another kind and open up the issues of perception or general consciousness, we enter into an inconvenient terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, he will do the same as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists judge for comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective survival to animal survival.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side prefrontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the language nature of a person: because such a large part of his perception is connected to the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if the consciousness of the language did not matter, it would certainly affect the language, so that the animal consciousness, whether constructed or not, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure even, due to special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, it puts us in a position to explore it against great problems.
Most of my extracts relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, addressed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of a non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I draw them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the system of fear, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activities.
What we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) takes advantage of the operating memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In conjunction with language nature, there is a subtle shift in perception, because by means of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states to attribute them to others.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in cortex and brain strains dedicated to physical sensations, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain strain.
Because this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could be peacefully involved in feelings perceived by many animal species.
I can’t resist it in theory, but I find it to be unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans is likely to feel the same way: But how can it be verified, says Pankseep, whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave like this?
The cockroache flees from danger - does he feel so afraid?
From my point of view, mere resemblance to behavior cannot prove the harmony of survival.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: the rats and humans have similar brain strains, by contrast, the cockroaches and the brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it to a man: how would we want to prove it to a rat?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, we can expect to see progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not examine language and consciousness, nor do I examine feelings, for I do not know whether they exist.
It is possible to think it is short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: The deadline for grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations would soon be managed directly by the president and the prime minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland,” Vasjunyk said.
It is not amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is a lot to do in both countries.
In the early implementation of the time plan of the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts go round.
It is possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time.
We must work as quickly as possible,” said Grigory Surkis, chairman of the Ukrainian Union.
UEFA will keep an eye on us -
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the Polish PZPN was removed and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewické.
“There is a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
UEFA President Michel Platini said he would not be prepared for ME 2012
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to a forced descent last season because of the manipulations, and eventually the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
Dennis Quaid is back
She wanted to advertise to a new film, she spoke in an interview about private things - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage-breaker.
He's angry and he's coming back.
The late Rose War with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors have been waging a terrible dispute in front of the public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan first expressed her marriage’s collapse: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She was told about the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The theme for this mental strip was Ryan's PR work for her new film, The Women, which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s response to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: He’s “crazy,” said the four-year-old actor of New York Daily News that “Meg repeatedly relives the history of our relationship and adjusts it”
In addition, it is “politating” that Jack’s common sixteen-year-old son re-emphasically resembles the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child.
While Ryan lives alone, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He ends his thinking about bending like this: ‘My life goes on anyway.
I think I’m happy to have a wonderful family that’s doing great.
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights, according to one current study, were even cheaper by up to 50%.
Flights and hotel accommodation have again reduced - this is the result of a study of the provider of American Express travel and financial services.
The company analyzed its data on reservations made from the first half of 2008 and, after price rises in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of prices on the hotel market rose, accommodation in many places has already reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities followed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
This trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express sees a weak dollar rate as the cause of this trend, which has caused the U.S. tourists to travel.
The decline in hotel prices has also been more strongly affected by financial centres than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have increased by 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
In the first quarter, airport prices also showed an increasing trend:
Due to the cost of Kerosin, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights cost up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of flights in the Economy class dropped by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes, changes in knowledge were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9%, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices fell by half in German national years.
One of the reasons for this price fall is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which has liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of a tense situation is the disruption of non-profit airlines and the high number of airlines that announced the competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the forefront of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer able to assemble a working eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach took part in the game until late and failed with a blow-out balloon on the stick.
His message was precisely formulated and sounded convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the Hamburg Arena cabins.
The catacombs did not do much, the break between the half-times ended, and most people were sitting in their places again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol approached and raised his finger on the sign of conformity.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg chief coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably like this: I'm here with my second goal!
There was no execution.
“There wasn’t a nice look here today,” Marcelll Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been more relaxed.
For 1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgers thank the head of Mladena Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbasians could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence this Monday.
So on Saturday afternoon, viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and a lively updated video table on the wall, in which their team was presented as a premium.
It'll be a birthday without a big party.
“We know how to evaluate it,” said Marcell Jansen.
He understands that the ongoing score of the table symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrité and FC Bayern of the obtained Jansen - is slowly located, but still unable to flash.
“We need more feeling and more dribling,” said Jol.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of sinking the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow took over.
Around 2030, this world’s most important exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was with more than 7% minus 1548 points.
The worst thing about it was in Dowa at this point American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles were strengthened.
The shares of Goldman Sachs lost almost 10 percent.
A few days ago Warren Buffett was involved in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive stock options of financial companies that could be paid in favorable course development, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Action courses in Europe are falling
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. has no doubt.
The course of shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly descending and downloads the Dax index with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular course losses of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have broken the German Action Index (Dax) deep into minus.
The shares of the said Munich real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of its value despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slips below a psychologically important limit of 6000 points and with a minus of 3.7% he scored 5,839 points.
Around the world, stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, a business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors are concerned that a US government bailout of $700 billion would not be enough to revive the financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent, and is thus 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate could express itself on October 1.
The other European exchanges were only in one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, and the CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743,61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286,90 points.
In India, the head index of Sensex lost 506.43 points, or 3.9%, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDax, they lost their share of Arcandor after the announcement of the capital increase.
The private bank, Sal. Oppenheim, has signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism company announced that Thomas Cook would not sell shares.
Dark matter influences spacecraft flight
For years, scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts are concerned that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, are now at risk of death in winter.
Among scientists, for years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - the anomaly of the gravitational washing machine.
Gravitational washing machine is an aeronautical maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some space body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens European-American research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the scientist has said for years in this case in amazement: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes speed up or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized with an anomaly of the gravitational washing machine.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, would not have to be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational practice by means of the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
“The responsible for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space researchers for about 10 years.
The force of gravity, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed, comes from it.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means that she does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, or even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, a fifth of the total mass of the universe is good from this dark matter.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are free.
After ten days in the hands of their hijackers, according to a statement by the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, tourists are kidnapped again in freedom.
The abusers from Sudan requested a ransom of several million euros.
Six hijackers were killed in the shooting before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom talks are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the hijackers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists incarcerated in Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya, and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: “Our fellow citizens and other hostages were freed.
“We are currently verifying their health,” Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are safe and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting remains unclear before the release of hostages: according to an Egyptian security officer, hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six hijackers.
The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom,” said the quoted worker.
He said, “It was just a hostage to take over,” when suddenly this surprise came.”
Sudan's soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six hijackers and two captured them.
The hijackers asked for a €6 million ransom for Germany; the money was to be handed over by a German wife to one of the hostages.
El Masri El Jom, who appealed to one of the German intermediaries, said the release of hostages was being extended because the hijackers were afraid of their security.
According to this report, the hijackers wanted to release the hostages of the female sex after paying the ransom.
Men should be kept until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo has refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by Fathers - led to suicide -
Several years of abuse by the father led the woman to kill herself.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, Michael Treris of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Coronary Court in Truro heard that he regularly bound his step-on daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
“I feel responsible for her death,” Treris wrote in a confession.
The court also said Ms. Randle had been killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes to her and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepson went to Plymouth.
However, the court said that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer to the National Trust organization, was persecuting a ghost of abuse twice a week.
The defendant, Ramsey Quaife, said in 2006 Ms. Randle's friends, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was \"emotionally dead\" and that she had given up her life.
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she suffocated with a bag of Igelite.
Randle faced his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended up saying, ‘I tied her up and bound her eyes.
“I didn’t abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death -
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, “You are an extremely strange fetish and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
“This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the thing would probably not have reached court at all -
“In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences that, according to Stephan’s parents, your crime against their daughter has had over the years,” he added.
Apparently, she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman.
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC found out that a government official who left strictly secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man left two top-secret documents on the Waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents were in the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against this law and does not imply a criminal intention.
A BBC defense correspondent, Frank Gardner, said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
“They probably thought the matter was done internally between the ministry and the government,” he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police be charged on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analysis of Al Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Cooperatives face B&B debt
British cooperatives may have to settle more than £80 million in debt after Bradford & Bingley’s bailout.
The government provided £14 billion to protect deposits of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley.
Interests of this loan will be paid by all firms that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Association of Cooperative Backups (BSA), said that he is “obsequent” that backups and their members must pay.
The 14-million-dollar debt will eventually be paid off by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest in the meantime will pay off all 700 financial firms that receive client deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are included in this number.
It is humble that these institutions, which behaved prudently... must now repay some accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the backups should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that debt interest will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that backups will need to find £81 million to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Cooperatives Association, said the BBC is convinced that this is not fair.
“It is depressing that those institutions that behaved prudently during the expansion of the housing market must now repay some accounts of those institutions that were far from being so considered.”
According to BSA, no backup since 1945, when it appeared, did not fall.
“We’ll have to explore all aspects of the matter within the next few weeks to see what options are to protect cooperative backups and their members from an account that could be substantial,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative deposits are shareholder-free organizations, this account will ultimately be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs five pence per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey said it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per liter by Monday.
This year it is the second price increase, after a two-pen price price in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price at customer prices.
Before the February increase, Jersey’s wholesale milk price changed last in 2002.
Bankruptcy for Bangladeshi Prime Minister rejected
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajidov to release on bail, which means that if he returns to his country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegation that she had obtained more than $50 million from a certain entrepreneur ($729,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption against it.
Chalida Zija, a long-time political rival to Sheikh Hasiny, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked the local army to give her complete freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was released from the word of honor in order to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is not clear under the conditions of her release whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasin’s request for bail, saying he does not need bail when he is already undergoing an examination abroad released for an honorary statement,” said her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq.
We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order -
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasina should return home after October 17.
She was arrested last year after an army-held interim government took over power, but was released from prison in June so she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasin and Chalida Ziya both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not participated in the recent polio vaccine due to violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations conducted vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she couldn’t reach the children in the southern parts of Helmandu and Kandahar for security reasons.
The United Nations spokesman said it did so despite the Taliban’s promises that it would not attack or defend thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB has lost a court dispute over ITV
BSkyB lost a court dispute over the review of the competition Commission’s decision, which ordered the company to reduce its share in the competing broadcasting company ITV.
BSkyB’s Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered it to reduce its ITV share from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share was competing and gave companies disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in a shop in 2006, which, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Office for Fair Trade announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB gave rise to doubts about the independence of ITV, and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium, Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator of Ofcom, were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was unwise and disproportionate, especially because BSkyB had previously said she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigation into the affairs of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on the affair, drawn up by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Norwegian Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to dream justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said: “Serious allegations, including potential crime, have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice decommissioned nine U.S. lawyers in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry said lawyers were released due to poor enforcement.
However, it turned out later that the release of lawyers was not rated by anything worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voters’ lying against Democrats.
U.S. lawyers are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under fire because of his release and eventually resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report by the Inspector General was very critical of the role of Gonzales in the affair, saying that he was “principal responsibility” for the release that he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “not very involved” in the event.
Other officials, including former senior Bush advisor Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who comes to the ceremony next weekend for his special gold prize in London said he was “honored” with recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf’s 1977 hit album.
This year’s nominations are led by the Coldplay Group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album, Bat Out Of Hell, has been on the chart for about nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, the real name of the Marvin Lee Day, suffered from health problems in recent years, and was also operated in 2003 due to irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on the vocals.
Obscurious streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other land roads, some famous, others only useful.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This little street is in East Village and leads north of First Street - without getting on Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic move.
There are no signs with street names.
It is practically invisible in the ordinary atlas.
However, he has an aisle of admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants Extra Place to newly pave and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-standing neighbors who say they were shortened by the aisle of charm simply because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was perfected.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of the Building, which has a street in its power, has no interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the community's land committee, representatives of the city's office and Avalon Bay were sketched with a plan that the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the General Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant when the streets remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
“The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession,” she said.
Proposals for correction and administration could be made, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to take up a small street and plant seats, several of which would be used by a cafe, whose interest in renting the space developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
“The main intention of Avalon Bay is to fix this ravaged aisle and make it a beautiful place for the public,” she said, adding that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Conservation of Buildings, said the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office is to develop assets rather than manage.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow trail in history.
Some people think that the streets got their name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's big farm was divided among several of his children, and no one was entitled to that narrow stripe of the country.
The back door of CBGB, a punkrock monument that closed in 2006, was led to Extra Place, and the aisle is perhaps best known as the background of the photo on the Ramones-Rocket to Russia album cover.
“This place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, Ramones’ manager, who took a picture in November 1976.
It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the refinement of the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, though meticulous, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah’s Disappearing New York City (with a subtitle: The Book of Screams: A bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction,) wrote a part of the story about Extra Place from the rubric, Let’s talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the day, and bordered by cutting iron doors of warehouses and crowded windows, where the week-old newspaper is overflowing in girdles.”
Except for a few exceptions, the aisle of one last night looked exactly the same.
The rat passed through the blind end of the street near the door, which once led to the CBGB, where today there is a shop with expensive clothes.
On the walls there was graffiti, and next to fresh doses of discarded newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A couple of passers-by say they rarely think about Extra Place, but they suggested that some kind of support might be useful.
On the other hand, Fields said he thought some people underestimated the impact of the aisle in its current state.
“The good years of my life,” he said, “were in the dark, wet and disgusting places.”
Bilingual Quality Debate: Immersion in English
In this edition of the section Focused on education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the attitude of candidates to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools”
Addressing Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult matter.
Barack Obama’s education agenda just proves it.
Obama’s campaign notes that “Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to get enough than white students,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama’s educational agenda promotes, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for those who are still learning English.
However, the question of Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in the Los Angeles East district.
Students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are learning English.
Despite this, state mathematics tests in 2008 reached the highest level of incredible 100 percent of fourth-class pupils.
Nearly the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-class pupils reached the highest level in state tests from English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved with a different method than what Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, continuous assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Next, and Obama should be aware of this, is, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are just learning English, ‘complete immersion’.
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me: “We had a tremendous success with one new student from Mexico - after 12 months you would enter the class and not know which one it is -
“It works,” she said, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take the school as the Sixth Street Prep as a role model, what should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English learners look like?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a long-time advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make Obama’s predictions clear.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he declared that people should stop worrying about “only English” laws.
Instead, you should ensure that your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to delete performance differences, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work, rather than mocking them and trivializing them.
Oil declines sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the US plan to save the financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The price of future oil trades fell by as much as 7% in the morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange to $99.80 per barrel.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial unrest on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July earlier this month prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel, and again, huge financial market uncertainty jumped on the wave.
Anxiety reinstated investors on Monday, even after the Congressional Bureau announced it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report has been obscured by the fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In a recent episode of the ongoing decomposition, the government announced that the Citigroup group would buy the Wachovia Corporation banking division.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments partially deprecated the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital’s analysts said the staggering weekend talks that led to a plan to save the economy prove unable to revive the market’s mood.
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates, and currency rates have gone unnoticed,” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a report to investors.
We believe that commodities will not be able to escape infection.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus spreads to all over the world and especially to China.
Analysts of this bank have reduced their expectations for the next year, as oil consumption has fallen by about 20% due to slower economic growth, and reduced their forecast for the price of gasoline for 2009.
Wild driving in the second quarter beats team record
After spending more in the Jets shirt than anyone else in the last eight seasons, the defensive Shaun Ellis player thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets turned the pointless game into a spaniel ride.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals levelled themselves with their troubled game of gloomy clouds over themselves.
Then the Quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranue Coles to the 12-yard touchdown sprint, making it perfectly ahead of the afternoon, in which their gradually developing collaboration shifted a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter for the next two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half of the match.
“It was nothing extraordinary,” Favre told Coles about all his events.
“He’s a damn good player.
We were very well informed, whatever people think.
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked the Quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a bad throw and returned it by 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith drew another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked the 20-yard goal out of the field, thus winning the 34-0 lead.
That's the most that Jets ever got in a quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when asked to describe this madness, said: “The second quarter, or the third quarter,”
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: \"I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
There are many points in a short period of time.
Gebreselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59, he fought in 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, has created a 26th world record for his career, which is truly incredibly wide, overcoming the world record, or at least being the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from the point of view of perhaps too grievous - that polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on the start, 55 degrees on the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What the track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on a longer track, the marathon record in the last decade fell by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a spasm in his mouth two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break was more likely to wake him up than delay him.
“I’m so happy,” Gebreselassie told reporters.
Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine.
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - because he had been overly planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon peaks, relying on drivers, as if it were a race on the track, and building world records over the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyas, Gebressasia reached half at 1:02:04.
After the drivers had fallen, Gebreselassie was driven by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles ahead of Gebreselassie's last goal, he fled Kwambai, who then took second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, she finished the year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19: Irina Mikitěnková, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
The 36-year-old Mikitěnková won the spring marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners flee into a big lead and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kipp of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the sprawled amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African American life come to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as easy as she described it in 1935: ‘the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of quayava, two schools and no prison’.
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to worship the Hurstons, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city that she described remains aside, even though it has made it a stop for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
She’s still as independent, worthy, and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural cops in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing.
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on the races, many local residents remain cautious of the views of strangers.
“We pay great attention to how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
It must be right -
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the Black Ascension and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is the centre of literature, but also of oaks a shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the locals are both proud and protective.
And the worry about Eatonville's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heart-filled books such as \"Mules and Men\" (1935) and \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city into road 17, which leads through the often overlooked centre of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With a big drum in life and in literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
“To the left side of the road,” she wrote, “is a white, brown-groomed modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even if he can’t read or write much.”
She also mentioned Dash's new widow husband and wrote that Lee Glenn is selling drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hourly hotel.
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville linked to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This wasn't the typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn’t a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
“Zora said it as it was,” says Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls’ choirs, who made Hurston immortal by citing men who sang stupid songs about their beauty.
“Some people didn’t like it,” she added.
He still remembers Hurston as a chipper, which often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time when she came to town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of a decent dress.
The majority of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were snoozing.
“The people of Zor have always been happy to see,” Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, - she never stayed too long -
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black girl at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no larger rites of sadness or large public readings.
“I don’t think they understood its significance for the world or its legacy at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s “Wrapped in Rainbows”, published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Representatives of the Orange County district wanted to stretch a five-course highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-seater main road.
Orlando's dissolution has already pushed the Interstate Highway 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a complex historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races of hatred was brought to the threshold of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at the people who sat on the side,” Franklin said.
“In fact, we had one lady here who killed it.
They threw a melon out of the car.
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston called into question the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and his decision in Brown's case against the Education Chamber stated that he was - for my race offensive rather than celebrating -
The people now claim that the desegregation of schools, even though it was positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the young people here.
\"Black children were used to hugging - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, hugged your teacher in the evening,\" said N. Y. Nathiri, Elly Dinkins' daughter, and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserre the Eatonville Community.
It took as long as teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
\"You don't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher - I want to say there's a cultural barrier,\" said Miss Nathiri.
However, civil rights helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudices with light-minded self-confidence and quotes such as \"How someone can vampire the pleasures of my presence!\"
I can't understand -
In 1975, Alice Walker made her way to the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the shelves in the bookstores with the praised biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, who re-introduced her in the American Canon.
The highway project arrived at the moment when Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramp again.
The former neighbors of the Hurstons now considered her a Savior.
To show what could happen to her highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
“The five streams of the highway have risen, you would say that it has directly fired, a real civic pride,” Natiri said.
“Zora saved Eatonville”
Winning over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Non-urbans like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the church in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston of course) was opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the centre of Orlando can sometimes act as a fallen alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today, 90% is black.)
Stranger people who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are often treated with caution.
The permission for most interviews must be given in advance and certain things - as wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church, painted by whites and depicted by blacks in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a brave, confident teacher who likes red, are still worried that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival increased, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and equally proud, creative, laborious, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, he sounds a sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police he says would use some help.
And even younger, such as 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned how to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, when they’re just walking around, think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing against the others,’” Alondra Kenon said recently after the church.
“But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York we all speak fluently financial
At first glance, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stands and giant television screens at Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never agree that in the glass bee hive of offices over their heads every day, bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York City, the worst-bad day in the office since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still mucking metal carts along the trails and transferring the muffins to the breakfast meeting.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human muls, fifty ironed shirts that hang from the vases on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in the queue for their morning bagel at street dining stands, and it is still not possible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between the fourth and seventh afternoons.
It didn’t look like a crisis until, with all the talk about pessimism, he decided not to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I was planning this task to hide with the late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase office, there were already about 20 people waiting in the front.
Not in front of cash boxes to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter, where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask about the road to the mixed goods store Macy's and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my “licensed personal banker,” came for the same reason as me.
However, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called thrifts (a bit similar to building savings), money associations and from those types of savings whose branches operate only in one state, and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 banks have quietly collapsed.
A few days ago, Washington's mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, went bankrupt, and when the New Yorkers returned home for a weekend on Friday night, another bank, the Wachians, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops who stood in front of me and feared another collapse moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that makes most of the saving on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluently in the last week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke to the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and to her exterminating chief executive, Dick Fuld, with such familialism as if she were a big-time colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed about fifty-year-old homeowner of my excavator, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me: “I now have my savings in the money market funds.
I've moved it, I won't risk -
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing party of the Free and Filip DeWinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, participates in the demonstration, which presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 organization-City against Islamization-
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police have accused right-wing extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties have made huge gains in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linze were sometimes badly destroyed between Friday evening and this morning, and the police believe it was an organized event.
The guilty sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as David's star, but detectives believe this could have been an attempt to disguise extremist motives led by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was connected to the election.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shocked” by the desecration news that comes as the Muslim fasting month Ramadan approaches the end.
In the meantime, Austria enters the round of searching for its own soul after the traffic went down in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
Both far-right parties, which have won more than 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, have vehemently led an anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans have been condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, who received more than 18% of the votes, protested in the campaign against scarves and burqas, and even expressed his resistance to the foods in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides try to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right at the position of the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel across borders.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
The officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel across France to Spain.
The Kent police were approved last Thursday after giving officials evidence of Glitter's past judgments for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, named Paul Gadd, did not attend the lower court in Kent at Ashford, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday 25 September at Ashford’s lowest criminal court, the Kent police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate -
Glitter, a 64-year-old, told the authorities he wanted to travel abroad, as recorded in the register of sexual attackers.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also forward the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police said they would not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A Kent police spokesperson said: “The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who will stay in Britain, because here we have extensive systems that manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the police of Kent, and we are working hard to keep track of the behavior of recorded sexual attackers in order to reduce any danger to the public to a minimum.
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnam’s prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass the passport check and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridg, the lowest criminal court in West London, and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully ordered him to register as a sex attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Interior Ministry said Jacqui Smith, Minister of the Interior, was calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
To capture the real character, I photograph the master out of the scene - Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls or costumes.
Only the essences of the great masters of flamenca, detached from the focus on interpretation, will I achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
Second, man.
Inseparable, if we miss privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of the lightly captured view or the passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to step out on the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in \"Flamenco-people\" - the theatricality of performing with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less well-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer creates a unique iconography of flamenco from various backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place within the Moon's Flamenca Photography Program (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenca, says the author and explains that \"Flamenco-people\" can be any people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people, portraited on the street, are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph on the stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
Charmed by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraits of flamencer singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the picture and lends it to the contemporary spirit, an idea which, according to Bauer himself, also mirrors flamenco: ‘Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and develop’
What takes the audience away is not the activity of the dance itself, singing or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is the constant work presented during these days in the gallery of El Photomata.
This selection of nearly 70 photographed artists is shaped by famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology and soon there will be a book release that will contain exposed portraits.
The passion for portraiting led Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea of “Portretes of sports veterans” two years ago.
Although their concept from \"Flamenco-people\" is different, the photographer admits that \"take pictures of people, get to know them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - this is my passion.
I think in the photo the portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person encounters or encounters people, personalities he sometimes doesn’t even know, or gives him only a few minutes to shoot.
In spite of similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
A collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called \"Flamenco-people\" is exhibited in the El Photomata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is “truthfulness.”
He takes place in an environment he doesn’t know yet and tells about the events of the unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for 20 years and has traveled in the Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature was admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival of Segovia that the project that is currently employing it is a boldness - and that - all of it indicates that I should not write - this novel.
“If I had reason, I wouldn’t do it, but I’ll do it, and I believe I’ll finish it once,” he concluded his contribution to the festival of exchange ideas, thoughts and words that he saw in the city of aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in four days.
The author of the novel “City and Dogs” was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens-Our mutual friend - has filled the Juan Bravo theatre in the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who presented him, he had before him a dedicated audience, whose hour of time ran out as water - a Peruian with an amazing accuracy and an accommodating dose of humor remembered how, from the original \"unbelievable adventure\" of \"the pleasure of the passionate reader\" and the power to live more than I lived - a literary mission was born; as he suplifies - the lack of inspiration - by writing -disciplinedly - carefully corrects and overwhelms; or how he influenced his writings Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas and what -remember images - are the basis of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that “there is no way to find out if and to what extent books can change their lives,” but I refuse to believe that literature is a mere fun, a fleeting experience,” said Vargas Llosa, emphasizing that people are “active” and “forced to try to get out of line” and calling on writers “not to be subject to frivolousness” and “take responsibility” for their mission.
Due to climate science, he loses a ceremony in Pozoblanec - he lacks a kick
The performance with the copies, which closes the ceremony in Pozoblanec, was cancelled last morning after the notice was confirmed by the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
Therefore, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, the company decided to cancel bullfighting.
Unfavorable meteorological conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not have been held.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for other planned bullfights.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
This is how it was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and paid for a dynamic and aesthetically quality performance was carried on his shoulder.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two wounds with a kick for greetings and one ear, which brought him rather uncovered seats in the arena than Toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bull arena Los Llanos, the unspoiled unfathomable.
In the second round of the drill without a single breath, most audiences have earned harsh criticism.
They took control of Alava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Road control Ertzaintza in the district of Armiñón (Alava).
They stop two people driving in the van and they drive them.
The cost, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, the members were persecuted and detained by one of the persons travelling in the van, a man at the age of 38 who was identified as A.A. J.
He was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on the N-1 in places where they passed the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver did not follow the instructions, accelerated and ran away.
The car began to race immediately, when the car stopped at the edge a few kilometers further, at that point both passengers jumped and fled into the forest.
In the end, Ertzaintza members caught up and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects transported, as revealed during the Iveco Daily van inspection.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the trade mark was “slowed” and disagreed with the data contained in the delivery documents, so he was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, whom, as mentioned above, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to deal with the appropriate formalities before further investigation took place.
Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested while driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, a popular Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend while driving under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Road Guard told People magazine.
The witness said that at around 16.30 a.m. Locklear was “swimming on the gas, moving forward and backwards in a noisy storm and trying to get out of the parking lot” several times, she used sunglasses.
A witness who apparently didn’t know the actress first saw Locklear’s moment after she stopped on a nearby highway and left the car.
This person also warned the rescue service because he was “fearing for the life of Locklear”
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside a car that partially blocked the road.
“She looked disoriented, and therefore the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress worked together and an excessive amount of alcohol was eventually excluded, yet - we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was seen at first glance by the officers -
Locklear was arrested for suspected control under the influence of the effects of the unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released several hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamarares urges the Andalusian Association of IU to exercise its powers in Silva
The general chief of the IU and the Member of the United Left Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports Town Hall in Seville Francisa Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting for the benefit of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
“I am an overly federalist, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers,” Llamaras said in a statement to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that, in the event of an investigation into the illegal conduct which Silva had committed, it is absolutely necessary - transparency - that \"IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible.\"
He also stressed that the party has a strict code of ethics for all public functions.
“Flow Blood” (’Sangre de Mayo’), the epic bet of Garcia
José Luis Garcia in the film “Mayon Blood” (Sangre de Mayo), inspired by the National Past Episodes of Benit Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish Uprising against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, he wanted to portray the eloquency of the characters and the analysis of society, which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film before a large team of performers.
May's blood with a methrage of over two and a half hours will be introduced into cinemas this Friday and in the future there is a more than four-hour TV series Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of Galdós José Luis Garcia’s literary work, he claims to have fulfilled his “Children’s Dream” by thanking Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago entrusted him to the Autonomous Province of Madrid with filming for the two-hundredth anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer that the event would be based on the Episode of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, which was fully contributed by the Madrid province, means for Garcia - a unique opportunity - to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of \"strench Spain,\" which was mistaken in the leader for whom it was going to fight - the struggle for independence led to the country's decline and backwardness during the government of Ferdinand VII.
However, the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that got to the movies Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy's ghosts - almost twice the flower's blood - so he could not make some scenes from the script signed by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost all over his film track.
The director of the film \"Start Again\" (Volver and Empesar) works as he is commonly used to - on the stage with actors he usually tries with before filming and who does not choose casting, because it seems - degrading - and also thinks - part of the director's profession is, among other things, going to theaters and cinemas and so learn what is happening in the craftsmanship he is dealing with -
Many actors who have chosen for May's blood appear in front of his camera by several, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia with four Oscar nominations, one of whom, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Flower Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiard and the last selected Blind Sunflower, does not represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that “she will only appear”
There is no award for this film, Garcia.
“At first, you think you’re working for what’s going to be after, but then you realize that you’re only working for earning, so you’re going to make another extra movie,” Garcia explains with a more than 30-year-old director’s career.
Isabel Bayon revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
Seville dancer flamenca pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of the Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusians (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved to London with their family.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life full of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, Isabel Bayon, has been charmed.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she designed this character for me - it seemed incredible to me -”
According to the dancer - we are not about telling her life, but about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the flamenco rhythms.
So, a butterfly dance called a guajira or a \"dance snake\" -- some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetics was also appropriate,” she says.
The performance is based on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Lead, who will sing in one performance as well as in the “Open Doors” (La Puerta Abierta), and with the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who has made an exception and joined her former student.
Matilde is an older Tortola, a mature character.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me -
In the performance, he also counts on the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paca Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; El Pájara drums, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Juárez, who has the role of eternal guide to this kind of artists who are primadons with everything, and who are always in love with them -
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place for her time in places as far as India, the United States, or Russia, and also throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was of those women who have a huge influence at some point in time, but today no one knows her, and even less appreciates her creation,” Bayon said.
The performance begins today at 2030 at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The Book of the Newly Married: Closes the Triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the Newly Married Diary at Saint Stephen’s Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government for the celebration of the “Zenobia Triennale and Juan Ramón” (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
“Zenobia and Juan Ramón’s training is about to end with the new edition of this work, an international congress that will take place in New York City, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the pilgrimage exhibition, “Juan Ramón Jiménez: The ray of the sun, which was opened in May this year, and after passing the various Andalusian provinces, should be moved to New York according to plans at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government has also ordered eight hundred copies, the Newly Married Journal, edited by Pedre Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most famous Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman no longer likes it so much.
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on \"No bad intentions\" and, under the weight of knowing that Newman left, reveals his unsatisfied vision of abandoned American cinematography and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He knew he was seriously ill.
He was still for all the guys.
“Sometimes what a person feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have lost a great friend now,” said Robert Redford in tears, “my life and my country were better thanks to him.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of the film and the homeland died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when desperately searching for reasons to be proud.
When time is harsh and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worth admiring - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and the fighter for both lost and won cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose to his own brand of home food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that cost a lot of effort to get rid of a suicidal eating culture.
The stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, said that not one man died, but one whole era.
Another Englishman, Oskar’s director, Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the highlight of his career.
A bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has a troufl of Newman to describe as his greatest source of inspiration.
“The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us,” notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman, based on honesty and leading a serious private life far from the cameras.
It is not always light in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful, even though he had more than enough opportunity to not be.
“Why would I go out to hamburger when I have a filet at home?” he joked.
Let him be proud in heaven that there is a relationship between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that “of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrifice philanthropist.”
The Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we're driving a race yesterday, I'm saying, \"No!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my opinion was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a dream of nonsense that right away, if it were to be evaluated and I was a tester, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Insenses begin with picking up a racing number, because of which a person has to go early.
This does not seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding of the path).
Oh, no.
Here one had to first pick up the number (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after the appearance of the right front) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt of size S (second nonsense, because I need the size of XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small t-shirts, because they are less substances and are cheaper?
All right, that's a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the queue took over 15 minutes, he had to hand over the backpack there.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, which is something incomprehensible at the race, where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as you can expect, the race started and we haven’t put down the backpacks yet, and when we did, it was much worse to pick up.
In addition, waiting extended the rain by 40 minutes, leading to a general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchodilitis tomorrow and some of us, like me, won’t show up the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me and which, as I suppose, didn’t record the time of the start.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this wouldn't have attacked me.
And so I think we're going to have to just keep up with a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At a conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system on the way artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like calling a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move throughout the company's campus) and perceiving what he hears in an interview.
With a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this receptionist can find out how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort out the current ones according to the conversation groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that talks to him and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going to see someone and tells her she's going to take care of her in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
That's amazing.
But that is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and won’t have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial unnecessarys, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a thunder when we consider that the Microsoft version from the version adds new features and extra to Windows.
Changing direction would be a meritous act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, because it is a necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your breath.
That's true.
It will never go away, but it is necessary to think of a 'death' operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, to more web browsers.
The computer is turned on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and each day we spend more time on the Internet than around windows.
What is half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They need it, and I have a small example here.
I took this photo in one rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the vending machine that asked them to use their search tools: ‘Your search. Our future’
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was later confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s just count on 2010.
In Microsoft, they will definitely try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay expensively for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one glow in Edward Zwick’s “Blood Diamond”, as well as Al Pacino in “Kmother” by Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of a uniform of a muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the calculation of his life roles, we can immerse ourselves in the image of a typical muscle with a pointed moustache that picks up the barbells in the nomadic circus.
Essentially, it is nothing more than a typical cotton men's bottom-tile, adjacent and sleeve-free.
English speakers call him 'tank', but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all the others.
First of all, because of his circulatory name - even though it is popularly called 'Markel' - which has a connection with sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other high-quality cotton, unisex-cut, distinguishing label and (nearly insignificant) Belgian flag, with models of the most emblemished quilts as a detail in the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not only specialize in tank tops.
It also produces sweatshirts college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, children's clothing, mini shorts...
Well-thought-out pieces for a comfortable underwear.
It’s a shame to be just a underwear.
They're too beautiful.
“I want to be a young mother. He who is a father doesn’t worry about me.”
The enormous form with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though tiny, is a woman full of life.
They are taking their new role in fashion very seriously by their sisters Cruz.
For Monica, that means much more than just having some nice, famous girls lend their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in a promotional event held in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most significant fashion prices sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's hearty and shy, and she's getting close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that we proposed for Mango this autumn-Winter season with Sister Penélope, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner in Opera in honor of Valentina.
It was a difficult, but also an exciting day.
What’s your new collection for Mango, for which you’ve been working for the fourth season?
I and my sister love films from the 1950s and 1960s, and we have drawn a lot of stimuli from them.
I also love to wander around town and watch women walk dressed, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from now on, I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house, talk in my aunt's closet and look at her clothes.
That was sensational, almost better than going to the pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to care how I was dressed.
But you know that we dancers are based on how we are adjusted to feel good about our hours and trials looking into the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been 30 recently, have you been a crisis?
No, no, no.
I feel better than ever before, I like thirty.
I find that a woman is already ready, she has experience and she enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clock doesn't scare me.
From now on, I do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body is asking for it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
When it comes to my father, I don't worry about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, there are now a few premieres of the films you made last year.
It’s the case and I’m looking forward to seeing them in the cinema.
I come from the theater world, and so I am very anxious and restless, I want everything right now and that’s not possible.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of La Ultima Hora - a - En busca de la tumba de Cristo -
As soon as you like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the show moth with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up the pier like a model.
Only she called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have long known, and invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization “Women for a better life” and the clothes we performed - I also selected two models from our Mango collection - was excavated and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are being said about her, and I, because I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's engaged in.
She asked me to perform for charitable purposes, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
In favor of women in the third world, I will do what I need.
Drivers repeatedly with alcohol in their blood will need to install alcolock
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car in drunkness or if he does not breathe.
The proposal entered knowledge already in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take the course of re-education.
In addition to the National Office for Transport Safety, the Directorate-General of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 per cent of automakers charged more than once during drunk driving will re-occupation behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures alcohol levels in the ventilated air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if a higher concentration of alcohol is recorded than the permitted concentration.
Its price is over 1 000 euros and would have to be paid by the guilty man himself.
A study conducted in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this equipment had been reduced by 65% during the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to save their lives every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: that this behaviour be addressed before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help its introduction, since legislation can be done in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
It will be tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE (Spain's Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without -peeptoes
With British precision, at 17.40 p.m., as it stood in the program, landed at Benita Juárez Airport in México D. F. in the Spanish Air Force, in which the prince and princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays were forced to cover their eyes so they could see a subsequent pair of out of the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood at the meeting.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, that's not gonna get you to the airport at the time... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's...
The Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to shoot an honorary salva.
The prince appears with a smile on her lips in a suit of dark blue color and a princess, very moderately dressed and with her hair, does not have her usual -peeptoes - apparently reported to her that in D.F. there is a storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and unenforce them.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, is waiting for them by a predicted Mexican television reporter.
The best-subsidised fashion price
There’s probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris, and there’s probably no better designer and bonvivána than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is awarded with an amount of 300,000 euros.
The Belgian woman Sandra Fasoli, the winner of the first year, looked at her designs yesterday in Manga’s statement on the Parisian Haussmann tabloid No. 54 and almost cried with a touch.
Sure, it is the second largest business of this company in Europe and it was just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer Valentin for taking over the presidency of the jury, caused us to finally dine in the Paris Opera Garnier.
The Mango company’s solemnly decorated presiding table looked a little more amazing next to Chagall’s most prominent works.
Nati, who with a heart-broken grief due to her brother’s recent death, did not show anything, wore this brand’s dress and ELAH jewelry, over which she was breathtaking, and hung into her son Luise, a nearly two-meter-old elegant, accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took a welcome and, as a real gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, for they were both offered to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - pants and shirts and dressed for dinner in long black sexy dresses, touched the night walk around the Opera with Goya Toledová's accompaniment, showed us a hall for ballet exams and, while remembering other times, caught one of the bars and pointed out - the Grand Plué -
Inés Sastre did not stop at the side buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us pictures of her son on a mobile phone.
The next morning we could love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own linen and towels and asked in advance not to use any fragrances in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la knows.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and angry everyday life.
And in order for it not to be enough, they are all summed up in one book, which will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm clock rings at 7 a.m. every morning as punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings present life.
The office is called voltage and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and to get away from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of the yogi position, classic massage and “spa” therapy on the pages of her book, collected a whole “menu” of options, adjusted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The book is called “1001 Way of Relaxation” and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace of mind to the bookstore.
If someone thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the manual denies this view.
In addition, it offers additional procedures to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up or tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak while sleeping.
When it happens for the first time, it might make you feel like it, but in fact it's insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you have told me that he spoke out of bed at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once per life with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There is not only one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night bias, enuresis nocturna (night soaking), or soreness, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or dilapidated situations.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a quiet voice, speak in individual words, whisper, or on the contrary (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it is manifested with great force, it would be advisable to observe and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him or her great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another violation of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to bother the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV shows or series.
For very nervous children and those to whom work can be relaxed, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them to get some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somnilcoves appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that she is harmless to the child and that the next day she will remember nothing.
Useful advice
Don't make him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're stopping him from sleeping.
Although he speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember that if you seem several times in a row to worry, it would be advisable to ask for advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If he understands what he says (which is not so usual), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It will not be useless, because when he sleeps, he is not aware of the fact that he can arrange his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he is saying, but you do not know what he seems to be saying, and therefore why he is saying it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you are experiencing.
Never tell your child that you can ask him his secret at night.
I'm not even kidding.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory after a long period of weight loss.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to transform one of them.
The game did not have too fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers were hard to enforce.
After the first attempt by Kauffmann's captain, who had only missed the link by a long-distance shot, Illhaeusern began to have a light top, and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg, or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive court in the middle and left only an agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names of Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well-positioned for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold experiment (53).
However, Golman Illhaeuserna did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to go back to the dressing room and leave his teammates in the weakening.
Dannemarie, however, could not benefit from this, and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who had just pulled off a little to \"sustain\" the defense, had no more trouble, except for the last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the belly after a big mess.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before going to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a ride through Brittany.
In order to face a demonstration of the forces of fishermen who seriously disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised that he would be accepted - in a constructive spirit - and hope - that he would come up with concrete proposals -
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the “crisis committee” created by Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against a sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak of over €1.14 per liter.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and payment of sailors.
Nicolas Sarkozy is a fisherman who is expected to be unrelentless.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation of “slow-moving vehicles” in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing almost 10km of constipation.
The Recreational Port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections in the direction to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was established on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination as early as Monday, when they burned tires and pallets at dawn in front of the warehouses of the ports in Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel of La Manche, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the traumas remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of merchant ships.
The Turballe and Croisic fishermen in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refineries in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they could decide to take action, until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the crisis committee is expected to decide on how to continue the journey and its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Department of Fisheries, which did not support their movement.
\"The strike will continue - because the fishermen will not leave anything - and - they will not come to Paris,\" said Liliane Cariou, head of the fishing department in Lorient.
However, fishermen who do not pay a oil tax currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but consider that the yield threshold of the ship is reached only if the oil is below 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman
An unforgettable representative, Butche Cassidy and Kid, died from cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also worshiped the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery assumptions for 2008
Brazil’s aircraft manufacturer relies on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft engineer in the world, Embraer, retains its delivery assumptions for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, confirmed by President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian constructor promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients over eight years.
AIG is considering moving 15% of its assets.
The insurer of the American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have received above water, is considering moving more than 15% of its assets to repay 85 billion dollars that were given to it as a deposit, the Financial Times said.
AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international field and pension activities in the United States, explains the daily, citing sources close to ongoing negotiations.
According to the FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday during the evening to investigate possible transfers.
Any confirmatory statement could not be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to get rid of include its subsidiary of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash in order to pay back the 85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the U.S. authorities will entertain 80 percent of its capital, at the same time dividing it into an appropriate ratio of current shareholders.
Paris. Analysis of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unexpected loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The largest point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, on the day of the restoration of trade after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to the definitive data after the closing of trading, 199.61 points and settled to 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Since the start of the session, Wall Street has literally fallen after an unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue banks by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to allow a little stability to be found again in the markets.
In a statement, 228 votes against and 205 against representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Almost two Republicans in three rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent out to the market that Congress is unable to accept a certain plan,” says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market has relied on this plan,” she added, and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come too late.”
“If this project is actually condemned to an end . . . . the team will immediately be handed over to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, the U.S. Central Bank) and other central banks to aggravate the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, Global Insight’s chief economist.
And with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza said that in the United States, every new day brings the fall of one financial institution.
After the crash on Friday, Washington Mutual was organized by the authorities to buy out Wachovi’s banking activities by her rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took turns and demanded urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that the markets are not only dealing with the American crisis, but with the global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has increased strongly.
The income from the cash order for 10 years fell to 3,632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, yield to 30 years to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama wins at points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second was to determine who won the two John McCain and Barack Obama.
The commanding tents of the Republicans and Democrats campaign were not surprised when they both declared their victory in the television duel, which was watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, however decent, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in surveys.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter, Obama is the winner for 39 percent of those surveyed, while, according to CBS, 25% assigns victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He’s gifted,” Bill Clinton said on the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent’s “naivity” on issues that were at the heart of the first conflict.
“It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that there were repeated charges.
“I don’t think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican television spots have been carried out since yesterday.
On the other hand, Obama stressed that it represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama did,” he said on a weekend with a democratic spot that told the Republican that he didn’t take enough into account the impact of the crisis on a ‘normal American’.
“In a 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in a statement yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina election meeting.
He didn’t even say words like “medium class” or “working” financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more competent to save the economy on the edge of the abyss.
“The next week could be a decisive turning point,” said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic prudence to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
The Illinois Senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected jumps of Wall Street, he should be able to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans, and pointed out that the country’s implementation of potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is its number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided the questions regarding the $700 billion financial aid plan, which was adopted by Congress last night and which is strongly unpopular.
“What you’ve noticed, there’s been some elections in Minsk.
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated Sunday night in the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarus gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the electoral rooms in Minsk’s main square to protest against the irregularness of the elections to the parliament.
Although no results have yet been reported, many young people have come to protest against President Lukashenko’s regime: ‘dictator, demisi’.
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the elections: “What would it be if they did whatever they wanted with my voice,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has remained welcoming to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, such as the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the election is considered clean.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
“We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census of votes,” said Juri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
“This is a cosmetic change,” emphasizes Alexander Milinkievic, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, “because it is important who counts the votes, and with us it is executive power.
If some opposition members get into parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean a space for television, a meeting in the regions and proposals for laws.
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, as dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, affects the crisis and we do not reform, we are threatened to become the protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the course of the elections, will not declare the election valid.
It stresses that participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of an early vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the way for all possible manipulations.
“What you have noticed is that there have been elections: the socio-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no leg in the electoral rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in Parliament, those who best suit the regime.
The night silence again took place in October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate on success.
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced because Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the trust of the public, who was seriously shocked after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is commonly known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated by the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and wave, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever was stunned to report, some provinces launched a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québek, the Gélinea Committee held this role.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was to be managed by Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the Supply of All Provinces and Both Territories.
“When Hema-Québec started its activities in 1998, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the quobec blood system,” Décary said.
“The situation was depressing.
By continuing to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area over the years, we have regained public confidence,” he said and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008, Hema-Québek trusted almost 94% of the Québek population.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that 'trust is something very fragile'.
Since its establishment on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
“We have seen many cases of human disease of mad cows in Europe, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease,” says a woman who has been leading the company since its inception in 1998.
“We didn’t know if this disease could spread through blood.
Therefore, one of the basic recommendations of Kreverov and Gélineau’s report, according to which, where we do not know this and when there is a serious disease at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take exclusive measures.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected blood from people who have stayed in the UK for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping to the principle of prudence made sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: tests with nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the donor blood to detect the presence of the virus itself, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests used before were based.
The NAT tests allowed to shorten the deaf period between the moment of the patient’s infection and the moment when our first viruses may be revealed by our blood technicians, the specialist explains.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing about it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood is now exposed to one in 12 million people.
In other words, it means that before someone becomes infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs through the blood product.
I think we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion needed for healing today,” said Héma-Québek, head of management.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which disease element can appear in the system.
Just last year, a chiungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by the banging of insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious,” continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
“The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has consequences for a blood donor network, which, on average, consists of only 3% of Québecians allowed to donate.
Any healthy person aged at least 18 years, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not on average accepted because, for example, AIDS or malaria wearers, and if they have visited a country where mud fever is ordered, they are excluded for one year.
With this 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Québek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the umbilical cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered to be biomedical waste, dries blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood samples from the cord into the bank, and we assume that we will take them over a thousand a year.
In the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the cord as very popular.
“Some mothers are disappointed that they don’t have access to it, because Hema-Québec doesn’t have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the first round of the USL, winning 3:1 (4:3 is a goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders of Seattle.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90-minute game.
After the two-sided goalless first half, the midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino took the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could deal with Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of the two quarterfinals, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat in the Starfire Complex in Tuquila, Seattle.
Impact will measure its strength in the semifinals with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder leveled the 3:1 deficit at home, and eventually won 4:3, Whitecaps, however, went to the semifinal round with a total of 5:4 goals.
Impact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first three Canadians are ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrej Kosticina last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canada 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev won one pass in this fourth win of three-colored six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
“I’m not ready yet,” said the Russians.
I need another game to feel good.
“In the first third, he tried to handle too much,” said Guy Carbonneau.
I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice thank-you.
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where a new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today’s complementary elections.
“Pull the limits of our last big northern border: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the end of the Québek Liberal Party Congress in Levis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind his back in some image mill.
On three giant canvases, there was a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the perspective -Google Maps - maps, etc.
Extensive means, like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would make early elections in the autumn, even though he said he had a very busy program.
The North Plan is the fourth dimension of the vision the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, the vision of the new economic space, which includes an agreement with France on the workforce, the treaty between Canada and Europe and the Ontario Agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - northern territory to the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a “global with enormous potential”, but did not mention the deadline, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the most he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further divorced: in particular hydropower plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's account, contains - nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds -
This country is twice as large as France is here in Québek.
And he’s not just with us, but he’s in us,” he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was appealing to a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, he highlighted the prime minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, the québec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after being aathelially silent to see a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of Québek’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all the governments of the past.
“There is one border line that no longer exists for a long time, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, in the name of the government, I will re-enter this position,” he said.
Otherwise, it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change, he said, when he talked about the north-west transition, which will be opened year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that the occupation of territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said the quorum government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The Interministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, has an important position as Julie Boulet (Transport and natural resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when a common vision will be drawn up.
The development of the North should be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
“The North Plan will be, jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he said.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as fluently following the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“As liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
Such was one of the ever-shocked topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting Jean Lesage’s 50th anniversary of joining the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that Beauharnois be baptized at Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out a peaceful revolution and nationalization of hydroelectric power, to Bourass, who created James’ bay, our party was able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program \"Roads to the North\" - John Diefenbaker, premiered between 1957 and 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
“I’m just saying it between us, but I’m going to be there,” he said to his member base, giving a lot of praise.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not even in 2009, did not rule out the opportunity to hold elections in the fall of this year, which allows him the law.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The Weekend Congress provided the Liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain “trying to change the constitution”, which went through very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) calls for a special recognition of the specificity of Québek in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint some of the members of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television, who would have the right to veto in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) CEO Pauline Marois re-pulled the North Québek Development Policy launched by Landry’s government in 2001.
When the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it refused to implement this policy.
If she adhered to it, “we would continue today,” Marois noted alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are running today) François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
“But we wish it wasn’t just a theatre,” explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is returning from his holidays today.
Letters - Dishonested Countries
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of justice (O irony) in Harper's cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that it was a shame to Canada.
This is how to disdain a woman who has led a constant struggle for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, which tells a lot about the Prime Minister’s surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not taken back to the country of its national closed in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
The government, which does not take into account that, at a time when the actions that are being drawn out for it were to be played, Omar Khadr was a youthful teenager.
The only government that, although Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets the child’s soldier inhumane.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the guilt of the defendant.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers advocate the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can wait for a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes before torture: little does it care that this young man is psychologically destroyed at the very moment, and this is undoubtedly permanent, after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of this, but we are witnessing the very erosion of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, the words that Harper so much bends and which of his mouth sounds so empty.
There is a time when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, and jail him according to the liboval of the head of the minority government so far (as it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims virtue, law, and order: they do not see that this government has renounced what has formed the reputation and seriousness of our country.
It's shameful, Mr. Toews, to move away from this, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discourse by Barrick Gold
In September 17, Le Devoir published a letter to Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has launched the prosecution of three authors and a poor small publishing house for insulting honor in order to trigger a “transparent public debate” and demands six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truth, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honor, but the law.
It’s no surprise that Garver completely overlooks this fundamental resolution.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate to the disappearance of anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process, authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable amounts in order to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight with the army of lawyers supported by the almost idyllic pockets of the mining company.
Tactics in these unbalanced struggles often consists in the destruction of the defendants in order to enforce the conciliatory proceedings that will clog the mouth of the counterparty and, moreover, will scare anyone who would dare to devote himself to the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have taken a look at the whole thing in public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada there is a debate under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, and not in the wounds with a collar.
Therefore, mining companies were not enough to open their books, document their documentation, and to create a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion, and he rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a “public debate” and also disdain the same public’s views?
It seems that this word in the vice president’s world refers only to fat-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
They have the right to speak in democracy.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, is doing so mainly because they refuse the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear and assess the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many see as prosecutions, in which the defendant is to be clogged by mouth (in the context of his prosecution of a public debate, Barrick has by the way just called on the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
If we miss the surreal Garver speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of inquiry and the search for truth that is essential to every democratic society.
In total, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without exhibiting ourselves to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be created by following the scientific norms used by Noir Canada authors.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive action makes it clear that, despite what he claims, he has no desire to lead a transparent debate.
For the university world, this is a loss, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would restrict such an type of unfair prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operations: Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, reached an agreement yesterday on the largest rescue economic plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, using $700 billion to stop the financial crisis, which has been clouded by Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of saved public money, new measures to capture the amount of homes seized due to non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to managers of saved companies.
U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and a Republican representative at the meeting table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration official Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done so that the real economy and the ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“This is an essential point: if we don’t do it, trauma, chaos and disruptions to the daily lives of Americans will be huge,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have started to reverse the fear of the effect of further failures in the establishment of investors.
The time limit set was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. president were invited to negotiate later, and they both expressed themselves rather for the deal, but did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama added some measures to the agreement, in particular to enable owners to maintain their residence, and to take measures on the wages of the state-leading workers of the saved companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary,” he explained on the wave of television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: “I’d like to see the details, but I hope so.
The gross features I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to spend and with which we will be able to move forward.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The goal of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy out dubious claims and risk and non-sale assets of U.S. financial institutions for the money of taxpayers.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis, triggered by the bursting of the real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
The decline of the first draft agreement of last week was carried out by Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats have come to the conclusion that for some “toxic” assets of companies having difficulties, the government will only guarantee, but will not redeem them, there is a belief that an unexpired situation is inflamed.
In order to bring the conflicting views of Congress closer together, measures were attached to allow the government to introduce new charges that would help it recover its deposit if it had to take over losses for five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan counts on the deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
Another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in the saved companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and which will be able to sell again when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the real estate amortization procedures associated with loans to which the plan relates, as well as set limits for the amount of valuation and compensation paid by the managers of the affected companies.
The plan would like to be voted in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes were raised against this project both in a Republican and democratic camp.
“It’s absolutely clear that Washington can’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s financial committee, said in a statement.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, making money on taxpayers is not the solution.
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the Skeptics Committee, presents the whole thing differently, but the same conclusion occurs.
“Four hundred esteemed professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us: “We ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully investigate which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, it has been reconfirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary after France’s BNP Paribas bank announced that it is withdrawing from its competitor’s purchase, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) as a result of the risk credit crisis to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
“We’re not going to lose that money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we obtain electoral rights in the bank and influence.
And it is precisely in the present day that the organizers and households are able to appreciate this insecure time.
On the other side of the Channel La Manche, it seems, the British government has begun to nationalize other banks affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was supposed to take over all of Bradford and Bringley’s existing loans, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were real estate loans.
According to his announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy branches and accounts of its clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his trumf, according to other weaknesses.
Is this American actor with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes or no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unrelenting talent that he owns also distanced him from the strength category that produces real stars.
What a long-distance runner it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 on his Connecticut ranch as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinematography.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he was similar, and for a long time was his rival on the film screen, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because the whole country in love with the self made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then attended New York’s Actor’s Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theater, television and soon in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who was second to Le Mans 24 hours in 1979, and at the same time a sex symbol, despite being a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also go the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the habit of his own show-business, which will forever remain to a certain extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble sense.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend has made the movie’s lovers dizzy, while his big roles compete on the black canvas of memories.
After it, it defiles more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art.
In memory, the charming Cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From the less ancient past (1990), we are equipping his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is alarmed at an advanced age by marriage that has failed to meet all expectations.
So many other Pauls of Newmans have gone into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a stunned, violent, memorable criminal from Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, which she made in 1956 by Newman.
Sympathetic Gangster in The Sting, Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character will feature in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar in 1987 with seven nominations.
This face that goes on forever, that's him.
And he again.
In his career he competes with various epochs.
The young know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of normless ice hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy by Coen's brothers.
His career was followed by the role of the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends that had left the craft quite soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its petals, feats and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, “a living challenge of underplaying,” considering that he was pushing too much on the saw in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as in the tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps, and desperate people whose fall and rebellion reflected in its perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shameful sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, features a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, who was lost due to overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness.
In a wave of honor that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former fellow combatant Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly stated: “His presence made my life and this country better.”
The generousness, the love of life, such are the main qualities of a dead actor.
If we miss his legendary career, he also leaves a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of Hollywood’s decline.
We used to see his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, cookies and other foods, which may have seemed quite tasteless, although at first it was about gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Heavy Childhood.
Newman, rather than letting himself be celebrated, has been involved in society until the very last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following words: “Always and until the end, your father was grateful for his happy planet.
I was honored to be here -
And for us, it was an honor to be able to watch the life path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, he will begin a criminal trial against Janos Zuschlag and his companions.
The politician and his companions are, in addition to other crimes, including counterfeiting, accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutors, they used the money they received in public competitions for their own purposes and often showed fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and self-government - with a total of about 65 million forints - went partly to the cashier of Fiat Balloldal, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The way the investigating authority was informed was that the money raised in the public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual consideration and the companies accepted never received the commitments.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were false.
The prints for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, and round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names on which companies are to produce invoices were decided, among other things, on a circular journey along the northern shore of Balaton, to which István Lados János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he had first named to look at guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he asked for accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices presented in public competitions were then produced, among other things, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, or the Government of the capital.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by István Lados and his companion András ’ri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the messages needed to obtain subsidies.
On his study trip, Lados saw one cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his colleagues in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided food for a 90-member group from Biztos Pont.
However, so many people would not be able to access this facility at once, according to the company’s manager.
In the same way, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002, entitled Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was bleaked by formal and content errors.
The guest house in Badacsonytamai had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one evening, yet a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the fillers of printers with rich imagination overtook this even when they presented to the documents the company dedicated to hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., in whose accounting, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor's office, documents sounding on the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even configure.
Győző Farkas, head of the company for hvg.hu, said that when they called him to the prosecutor's office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew it was false documents.
The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp.
In addition to the formality, he said he did not agree that 100 people were accommodated according to the invoice, because they only have 11 rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food was also included on the invoice, with their restaurant not working for a long time.
The enthusiasts of invoices did not convince themselves that the visited Budapest travel agency was organizing only foreign trips, and the invoice with cash payments, which was also not in line with the company’s billing practice, they said foolishly as a travel brokerage service in Hungary.
In addition, VAT was also included in the document, as was the case during the investigation, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, the Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. did not agree, among other things, the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25 percent, but by 15 percent VAT, and in addition, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, the publishers have destroyed the invoice by indicating for one company how it was revealed through the investigation of the public prosecutorship as a road transport activity of goods that the firm originally founded on investment advice did not carry out.
The fact that invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the 21st Sázadi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont Foundation are false has also grown due to formal deviations - an inadequate format of invoice and an incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sport Camp in Kunfehérto, whose representatives denied to issue invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in the time (2001), when the group from the company Fiat Városért ate in liquidation, which is why, according to our information, the company’s winding-up commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
The invoices were displayed consciously
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew they had to issue a fictional invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiat Balloldal - Ifju Szocialisták.
The head of the company Collab s.r.o. caused one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account according to the charges.
Zuschlag and its partners also cooperated with Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth about five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, however, the organizations have already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Another group of billing companies included those who had links to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov, the authorized representative of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió s.r.o., engaged in the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, on which the company is not found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskinhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The head of the company was a man from Romania, to whom he was to hand over documents concerning the company to Iván Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért associations and himself accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they didn’t get a job.
However, the companies were in favour of him, because at the request of the co-appointed lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices to Atlasz and Y-Generació, connected to Zuschlag on behalf of the companies.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutors said Cubatov had come up with 10% of the amounts on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictional invoices, this time for Biztos Pont, the man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
Y-Generació and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted in January 2006 proposals to the Mihálye Tancsicse (TMA) Public Competition, a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand forints, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA presented five fictional invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a house inspection at Árpada Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the course of the production of invoices, as she has already done in the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if he decides to reveal everything himself to the main defendant János Zuschlag.
His testimony to this day is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will completely interpret everything, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the compensation of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the socialists have concluded an agreement with him, and Zusi will take it on.
After all, he may have been insulted, because his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely to place him in a home prison, have not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes who have committed far greater damage that they have not yet paid can freely walk or at least wait for the end of their conduct in their homes, he has no such possibility.
The psychology of trumping: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to be late in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The study, using an experimental auction, attempted to map the scheme of this ‘game’ in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers was betting, the other group participated in a playful auction, using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method to study the active areas of the brain of experimental persons.
In both games, the participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, the important element of which is to knock the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to function intensively during the loss.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-rewarding” mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible to explain the screw-up of the price by trying to avoid a sharp strike reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team from a number of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups were charged against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of a given product is, and they made bets.
In addition, other members of the group were promised that if they left the game they would be awarded $15 more.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost that money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, everywhere in the fact that one was highlighted by the win and the other by the loss.
The members of the group playing against the loss, however, were willing to go higher than in the control and “winner” group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
For they have so far explained the phenomena noticeable in auctions of joy of victory and avoidance of risk.
“When neurological imaging methods helped us solve the contradiction between these two theories by now reaching the third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to seek a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be 100 thousand, but only 7,000 of them are treated. The cause of this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, a symptom is inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the originators of the disease and their caused disease differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the origins of the disease: hepatitis A and E by digestive organs (for example, infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses of blood and body fluids (sperma, vaginal secret, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, urge to vomiting.
Then on the skin and eye whites form jaundice, light stools and darken urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected drug is treated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver circus or liver cancer.
Most infected with their disease do not even know the originator of the disease destroys the liver cells in a bad way, and so the first symptoms appear in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to timely prevention, implementation of regular signings.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had had a blood transfusion before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of subjects infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million.
Since the disease can already demonstrate a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his or her practical doctor if he or she notices any symptom of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing infection and preventing cancer.
September 30 is a world day of hepatitis, which was first organized worldwide by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to highlight the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn’t hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic, which could have facilitated death to Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects pain perception, according to the British daily Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a detailed study of the human brain, Catholics have also been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
Research is the first in a series of researches, which scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university participate alongside academics.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a sparking tool to the left hand of the experimental entity, which issued electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants of the attempt to carefully observe two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Lady with the edge of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would create a certain state of piety in the believers, while da Vinci’s paintings were chosen because they were not too different from the first and were acting in a calming sense.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this time they received in four consecutive parts of 20 electroshocks, while separately watching the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics stated that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as if they were “careed” and “relaxed,” they were fulfilled by peace.
When watching a religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard’s work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any strongly impressive image even in atheists, only the right photograph must be found.
“We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father,” said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a matter of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they had shown them some Madonna by Leonard or painters of a similar calibre.
Would it mean a look at the quality of Our Lady to achieve even better results?
You're what you share.
Google’s 10th birthday can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what kind of professional examination they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, this is still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics doing parallels with Orwellian dark vision are concerned, this is not the very essence of the 2.0 website.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal information about users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to be able to stick to their original intention, which was: “Let’s organize all the information in the world.”
According to Google, after ten years of world-class work, the company still stands at the beginning of working with all the information.
Asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt answered that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like, “What should I do tomorrow,” or “what kind of work would actually be useful to me,” but software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough information about users.
Not all internet users know well that the search results are accurately captured by the search terms and the IP address they were looking for, and what pages they moved to after the search.
With Personalized Search started two years ago, for example, users can retain their surfing history, look back at what they were looking for, and click on, so that in the long run they can generate findings tailored to them much more directly - the same logic will also be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer products and services based on the previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at me, what do I do? - they ask users who are afraid when looking at the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not create guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such statutory cases, the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known example of the past was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the community sites of Orkut, established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May when the company successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI when the company was forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it received with reference to strengthening the adopted Child Protection Act years ago, yet it failed to obtain lists of searchable items of individual users, or complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
Google’s view of Google is so contradictory: it’s bewildered by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by using Google’s services, and they oppose it with a revolt that belongs to multinational businesses with a conservative image.
And so far, the American Geek culture and its wild branch, clustering around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of largefire, ‘corporation, which now frustrates,’ unlike its Microsoft rival, considered Windows to be the conqueror of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, youthful, “cooler” than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this can also be due to the fact that geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship between the internet and personal rights, which has brought with it just one of the most arched keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can have a profile on several Facebook-to-Xang community sites, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm apps, which record music he listens to, and then connect everything to navigational systems such as Friendfeed or Blip.fm, in addition, he can write a blog on which his latest photo galleries will automatically appear on Flickr or Picase.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she will emerge: a girlfriend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of common friends will easily figure out with whom her crazy friend spent the evening, or the company can fire his worker only because he will show his sincere opinion about the senior management on his blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reviewed today.
Those who live an online life consist of what they show themselves, so we can define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google’s monopoly has an option (beginning Scglu, which uses Google’s search system, however, does not intentionally leave any traces).
For example, a small number of people are not registered on a community site so that they can not be found. The Google online application from text editor to photoeditor, and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not make us the highest quality possible profile.
Public opinion doesn’t secretly expect Google to show teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($144 billion), or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the investments of advertising agencies and services introduced at an ever-increasing pace seriously make life not only to Microsoft, but also to numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints acting as a disturbing impression: for example, the chief executive completely rejected employee protests after raising to twice the corporate kindergarten fee, any frequent daily meals of employees were too expensive according to the company’s management, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google was still leaning ahead of the Chinese government in 2006 and, within the meaning of their agreement, every finding that pays good taste, or the interests of the Chinese regime, is filtered.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when it is already possible to use them, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can move the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project, aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines, takes on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are scared of its health system, because in it we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of science fiction writers, the famous Cory Doctorow-Screated novel, describes the future with Orwell reminiscences, in which one can approach the human well only with the help of data from Google.
Two-time killers from Ózda helped remove the traces of two youthful people
Two young people have been questioned by the police in the case of a double murder in Ózda, according to a reasonable suspicion they helped with the removal of the traces of this crime, said a spokesperson for the Supreme Police Directorate of Borsod County on Tuesday.
Persons who have been suspected of being accused and are currently accused of aiding the crime.
Both young people, according to MTI information, two girls, are prosecuted for freedom.
The aid of the crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of a double murder in Ózd, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a crime pre-planned multiple killings for self-imposed reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old man owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he attracted his creditor last Wednesday to one establishment in Ózda, where he first killed the man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was pre-prepared to commit the crime, which is evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder of a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapons and circumstances of their use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100 percent package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of a Polish state that wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
The Viennese Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have been offered so far.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner from all stakeholders, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold out.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent stake, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European letters
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe’s leading letters are already commemorating the second September 11th.
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the President of the United States, allegations of the Roman Republic. The President was not even able to sedition his own party in support of the fast-to-pay bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the guilty in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the world economy has brought the lack of political leadership to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is constantly growing, which will eventually pay the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be left behind, says the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw a bailout circle at the right-wing monetary institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
However, if other banks collide as cubes, then neither funds nor further improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and unify control of the broken financial markets.
On Monday, more than 100 billion euros were received, the Vienna Der Standard reminds us that, just as Americans will have to reach deeper into their pockets, European taxpayers are becoming more real.
The European Union has been serious about the crisis that has been rolling through the old continent as a tsunami.
“The rescuers may not immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they firmly determine in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers’ money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car imitates flight of bumblebee
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitations of detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, at the bee.
The initial strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC trade fair, was introduced to engineers from Nissan by bumbledoers. It was about how to build a new generation of collision prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has constructed a biomimetic BR23C-type robotic control system, a robotized mini-car equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all precipitation.
“In the course of the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is in fact very similar to our safety packaging,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for the field of technological PR and R&D.
Folded eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the folded eye, engineers reached after the idea of a laser telescope.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters before BR23C in the 180-degree field of vision, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation to prevent collisions.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts to imitate the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this elusive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If that were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshijuki Ando, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety protective packaging, within which precipitation is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bees do to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than a wink of the eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can be rotated.
Instead of endless options offered to bees, only the possibility of rotating, acceleration and slowing were applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent reactions are important, not the processing ability, the less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few incoming signals per second.
It is not necessary to store and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only memory of a few kilobytes.
It doesn't need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan’s estimate, could reach mass-produced vehicles within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be a connection between the unit and the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles, would lead the motorist to the ultimate goal.
An expensive child already has a name.
The $700 billion bailout bill, which is supposed to be split into several installments and aims to buy out poor-quality loans from banks, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended only Saturday after midnight of the American East Time, Congressional representatives reached an agreement in a few days on a rescue package worth a total of $700 billion, Reuters said.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, who said only the signing of the agreement remains.
Both Barack Obama and John McCain supported the package compromise.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will work and will be effective, but further action must be taken.”
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. at Washington Time (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m. Central European Time), but there was no special rise on the exchanges.
On the proposal for a legal standard, which is called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, to be established by the programme, will be voted first on Monday by the House of Representatives, then the series will be held at the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the news of the deal was also welcomed in the White House.
“With the progress made at night, we are satisfied and highly valued by both sides’ efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, in turn, differs from the original draft of the Bush administration, in which the whole amount of $700 billion was to be spent on the purchase of poor-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend in the first around a maximum of 700 billion, by using 250 billion immediately after Congress decides on the matter on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will purchase mortgage-backed securities, which are rated as poor quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President’s decision.
The program will be controlled by a special body, whose member will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision by Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the law, apply combined tactics: it can simultaneously buy out poor-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other “toxic” loans.
The purchase can take place in the auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry said.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee of funds representing a reason for concern, for which the company will pay the price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to make up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it be a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risks associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
“We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed,” he added.
Bank chiefs who are in trouble waiting for the state to help, on the contrary, can count on the government to reduce their severances - which is simply called the \"golden parachute\" in the overseas slang.
Their payments will only be reduced in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The limitation basically means that if the Ministry purchases in the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on the gold parachutes if the fallen directors of the bank are not sent straight into retirement.
In the case of direct redemption of poor quality loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It is necessary to add that the already existing contracts on gold-falling fallers do not change, only the restrictions apply to new contracts, which is intended to be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
“This is the first case in American history where there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs,” said the president of the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank.
In addition, the random state in the banks participating in the programme has the right to obtain a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since once the economy and the bank, together with it, are on their feet, they can also make a profit on this transaction.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress to determine how taxpayers can be returned to expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, votes on both sides in connection with the plan of doubt.
“This is not what the U.S. citizens have asked us to do, because this will not protect the taxpayers’ dollars,” Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that precisely those responsible for Wall Street's collapse have been urged to adopt the provisions.

Next year without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is a great hope that the U.S.-Hungarian Visa Waiver Agreement will enter into force around 12 January, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, almost everything matters now, if an electronic road permit system, or controls, are built in a timely manner outside the sea.
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not be allowed to enter, but tourists will need to be registered before leaving.
The Hungarian diplomat has been in talks in Washington since today.
He meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Order for Merit of the Hungarian Republic and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers of President Barack Obama’s Democratic Party and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain to save banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidents of the two major American parties, said on Sunday they have secured their support for a $700 billion government bailout package, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After several days of the marathon meeting of Congress and administration officials, it was announced on Sunday early in the morning: a basic agreement on a bailout package was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to tip the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are described as more suitable for both candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
At the same time, according to the latest surveys, as the economic issues came to the forefront, Obama once again gained a certain advantage, and McCain’s lead spread, which he secured after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s nomination as vice president.
On Sunday, Obama expressed the hope of a 700 billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-b.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages concerning consumer protection, which he also supports.
“We must act immediately, responsibly... to your places, to your savings, to the entire industry, to the stability of the entire economy there is a danger,” he said in front of the 35,000 crowd.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s ideas about the economy obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It’s going to be a bit of a treat...but nothing is just a way to go.”
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a committee that oversees the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the step-off for the top officials he insists on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no more important role in the negotiations, and he himself was with the minister in daily contact.
House President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill on Monday.
Print overview of German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters within it have become more confident - so it analyses the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled \"Bavorsk Revolution.\"
According to a well-known political scientist, the CSU erosion began much earlier than the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over.
Christian socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - and these modern citizens are now turning away from them.
The alternation of the period is the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore of Angela Merkel.
The debate was not quite surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could be assumed for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50% threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so often mentioned by Stoiber.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at a pace they have been very wrong. Secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the East and North in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without the consequences of the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters within it have become more confident, more critical, more self-confident.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks CSUs have been the most distant in the classical civic classes; people in the free profession, tradesmen, individuals with high school and university education.
CSU support is below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article titled “Who, with whom?? The party presidents are restraintd on the issues of the coalition”, the conservative Vienna daily deals with the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP is committed to intervening SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all actions, greens do not yet want to negotiate on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presiding parties did not have much to look into their cards.
The President of SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership exists.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was announced for every fall.
The repetition of this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offerings.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, it is still completely open in the party, these questions need to be discussed definitely within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility,” Haider said.
Jaróková: A vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit of Equality, which this year is hosted by France, was launched by the current President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of expert negotiations in her message addressed to the plenary, turned attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, the conference was launched by the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was held between invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the news agency of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment, Roma are driven out of the European labour market, mainly because of their low education.
The vast majority of young Roma do not have high school education, and as a result of the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher degree of education.
Jaróková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of these contexts in the widest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties they contribute to the national budget.
“The Roma are the right of their national citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their under-quality and separate education,” said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, cohesion of the European Union is needed, with an emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, in order to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools immediately, which is primarily important to comply with the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
“It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to give Romani children the opportunity given by democratic space to participate as full-fledged citizens in the future of Europe,” Járóková said.
Everyone is in the sign of a European Year of Equal Opportunities, guaranteed the objective of the European Summit of Equality, held annually since last year in Berlin, to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and eliminate discrimination, set at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein will decide at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may remain in their seats, the question is, how long this grace will last.
The fate of tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17% loss of votes, is determined by the last October weekend of the extraordinary party congress.
The members of the highly criticized duo have in any case been heard that they will not stick to their posts from all their strengths.
So they tried to calm the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the “Bavorian tsunamis” - the embodiment of personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of her career - gained a Christian-social union of 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but her strengths were only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, CSU has been producing 18% of German GDP for 46 years.
While conservatives continue to have a high position in the southern federal country, which has a key importance for the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
One of the first features of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a narrow intelligence team that will launch probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with a liberal FDP, or with a right-wing group of Free voters, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is an irony that Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the duo Huber-Beckstein to perform the coup, got into the House, but then made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber, who has so far played threads from the background, was the former Prime Minister of the Earth and the former CSU president, called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber smothered several comments about the CDU address, which he said would be worth a lot more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in national success in 2005, somehow does not put the common forces on its feet.
Merkel said the loss of CSU positions would have no negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
In Sunday’s elections, no opposition member was allowed to join the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the illegalities that took place in the count of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of 10 million has been missing the opposition for ten years now, the opposition associated under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday’s elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of a change in the constitution in the 2006 elections and the fourth time renewing his presidential mandate, will allow several opposition MPs to appear in parliament.
ODS has abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition expectation, Russia was increasingly dependent on Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the increasingly costly Russian imports of natural gas, took credit and contributed to Beltransgaz, the gas pipeline-owners of the passing countries, getting into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment, as assessed as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians, they did not receive entry permits.
It was previously pointed out that when evaluating the election campaign, the OSCE placed emphasis on positive shifts and not on shortcomings - for example, a ban on the candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE Flash Report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press, especially since the opposition could not be present in the count of votes.
At the same time, it is possible, according to the opposition, to feel improvements in the political system: political prisoners were released for freedom, and Minsk is willing to let go of Moscow and smaller confrontations, while he continues to refuse to recognize from Georgia a torn South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, considers these two territories as independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” said Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain the case, even though “it is too much to allow a single opposition member into an insignificant parliament.”
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protests, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
“With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, opposition letters must be printed in Russia, distributions are putting obstacles to local authorities, but I see that the change is supporting more and more people, even among the elderly,” said Millinkevich, citing that Lukashenko’s regime, which considers that the creation of social security is not the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
“Because of the country’s debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when the social security of the ‘inducing silence of the cemetery’ collapses,” Millinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian observers rated elections as democratic.
The Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that “people do not believe in words but in actions”, so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From today’s breakfast before work”
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was introduced by a rotating door at the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today on, this new measure will begin to work against the greasy people, against those who drink and then go to coffee in their working hours.
The news against leechs was released today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the President's Council, Maur Maur Masi.
“The rotating door,” Brunetta says, “is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presences and more services,” he said.
A new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
It is reformism,\" Brunett said.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation of the Council Presidency in all buildings.
For Masi, the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.
There were no objections from employees, the Secretary-General assures: ‘This was a joint procedure with workers and cooperation of all’.
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, \"There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning.\"
During one conference at the Higher Professional School for Public Administration
In Rome, the minister finally announces that within three months the absence of public workers for the disease decreased by 50%, i.e. 60,000 people more per year at work -
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more powerful
- its payday dynamics - explains the minister - has doubled in the last 8-10 years due to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate -
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunett’s decree standards in line with the Codacons-backed requests.
“While the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures on the lower absence of disease-related work,” the consumer protection association writes, “the nation of ‘solid leechs’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war on illegal norms contained in the decree.
In particular, Tara will protest against the exclusion of sickness surcharges, which depend on activities; the extension of the period in which the sick person can be checked, the time limit within which the inspection visits will be carried out, and the other standards included in the new Ministerial provisions.
Work Injury, Napolitano: ‘Result prevention’
In Italy, 2,500 work injuries happen every day, three people die, and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail’s figures confirm that we have approximately 1,200 deaths in 2007 as a result of work accidents.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the death rate compared to the murders.
In order to regain the attention of institutions, social and information resources to this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Labour Accidents set on the second Sunday of October.
“The alarming data extended by Anmile and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of occupational security is,” said President Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmila, National Association for Mutilated and Disability for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint efforts to ensure safety in jobs, protect injured workers, help the families of victims and share public opinion.
“Naturely, an outraged ‘stuff’ has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, by their scale, provoke a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the daily reality offers us dramatic cases again, even repeating itself in its dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that “there is no doubt that there is a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
Numerous initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance, so that young people facing the world of work gain a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The president of Gianfranco Finni, on his part, stressed that “as a result of a work-related accident, the phenomenon creates an absolutely critical social state, as it insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make persuasive efforts towards the necessary end of this state.”
“As for the data of work injuries, it seems to show a certain positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from accidents is as alarming as it is,” said Anmila president Pietro Mercandelli.
“We wouldn’t just want this “trying to reduce” to lead to less attention, because just when attention stops, tragedy will break out.
We believe that in general, there is still too little to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from the school age -
“There is still a need for further effort,” he added, in terms of communication and participation in public opinion.
But most importantly, there is a greater sense of responsibility for employers for the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon.
In the end, Mercandelli declared that this was a progressive degeneration of the level of right to compensation envisaged for the victims of work and ‘deposit of support care’ to which the system has been reaching in recent years.
“The goal is therefore to return to the worker the guarantee of insurance,” he added, “because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator.”
MP3 players accused of hearing risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music instruments as an Mp3 player can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's Communication from the European Commission, citing the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which recently emerged and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
- From this scientific point of view, we read in the notes - it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music instruments for at least five years, per week more than an hour per day, and maintain a high volume device, risking permanent loss of hearing ability -
“I’m worried that so many young people who use often portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” said Meglena Kuneva.
\"Scientific findings - the lead continues - show a clear risk and need to be reacted quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to become fully effective and to keep pace with the new technology.
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
-Scientists - closed executive Eu - confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be put in place, and thus better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, whose origins are portable musical instruments and similar devices -
At present, there is a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is very possible to limit these damages by looking for a solution as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee states that users of portable music devices, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours per week, will exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno to leave free progress to the Commission for the Future of the Capital
Today we will start, we will close in March, we will have amounts in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers - the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome - who met this morning in his new headquarters behind the Caracall Spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the commission will draw up a manual for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with a \"official stamp\" - Campidoglia and his councilman Gianni Alemann.
“The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included there,” said Alimanno, “It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by political judges, who remain the Giunta e General Council.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but only about trying to have a place where to process a large project for Rome.
In March, work will be completed and then dissolved, as these institutions must have an exact time limit.
In June - announced by the mayor - we will present a strategic plan and use the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome -
To the one who accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that her opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will say: “It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of high quality, like the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics breaks down on everyday problems and on the urgencys that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that ‘this Commission is neither an unnecessary enterprise nor a blaf: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not cost the euro and will serve to think about and engage the best intelligence the capital has’.
For Alemann, in essence, we must have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor unmoving, in order to allow our city to truly rise to the level it needs, and to think in a united spirit of its future.
The future, which is specified by the mayor of Rome, will not only be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further - not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status, but also in the role that Rome can and must exercise as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean -
Obama? First anti-American president. Already know why
One well-known U.S. president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, deciphered the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks against Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
One woman from Miami wrote on the website: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama, however, has a fury: he thinks he'll get to the highest position of a nation that had two governors and five black senators everywhere.
In fact, these attacks don't say much -- they are attacks of clear racial origin and don't answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have surveys too; they all say that Obama will win and with great lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not by the brain.
One Mississippi newspaper, from the South of the United States, wrote a comment: At least once in the electoral cabinet, we know who will give his voice to the American patriot.
One side of the American mentality that remained skyy until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to check if Obama or McCain --
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
1500 people asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, the lives of 4,500 soldiers were destroyed, and Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet, Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush’s weaknesses.
Anyone who enters Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse was also felt by journalists: there is an investigation period in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the “killer,” the press.
The PEW Research Center has asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly say that they were less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they used to.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to bring together the newspaper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change substantially, as the general public understands.
American journalists are undergoing a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors believe that a national journalist is on the wrong track.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
The larger publishing house is a roadway to the internet, which many view as a “killer,” a newspaper.
The economic pressure that journalists point out has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists have admitted to resorting to technology in the hope of doing something good for their journalist.
The biggest abyss in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms - that is, leaders - and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with “certainty of work.”
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% national.
As far as journalists are concerned, they are up to 30%.
As far as “certain work” is concerned about staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a vast nation as the US, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so the question is to take or leave.
Leaders almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month outside of paying salaries and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, up to 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within one year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: The Court of Rome, Danilo COPPOLA remains in the GROTTAFERRATE
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of an entrepreneur with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sales sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process at his own expense, he was released from a home prison last week, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his place of stay from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (which he expressed pm) would allow him to influence his society and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger
A few days ago, the House of Representatives voted against a bailout plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in Wall Street punishment than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, a milder, more friendly to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to the “things of Washington” and to the world of finance, strong especially in the middle and south states.
A soul that was arrogantly shown by the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
However, this very quoted thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as a accelerator of phenomena that have been incubation for a long time, which have become stronger in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category of State-power in relation to a certain rebirth of economics.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which they are mainly included to the greatest extent the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This has created a political problem for those who drive it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of play or has nothing to say: the obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot be decided on a single common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: when we get into need, only the states have economic resources, a number of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And it also owns the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization can ever have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on a state-national element, is in complete harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the recent economic progress is trying to bring to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the sieve, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance had already been destined to rule the world, we realized from nothing that our future would have to deal more and more with such small nonmaterial things as water, grain, oil.
All things that would be said can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a limited space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler, certainly has a lot more cards in his sleeve than who is not, and who has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I get to the second news, which predicts the evil.
He who speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, leadership.
Given the economic crisis, there seem to be two converged phenomena.
On the one hand, realizing that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, an application for someone who could take the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditation against existing leaders, especially economic ones, which has proved equally inadequate and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a certain sense, disturbing: discreditation, impatience, a sense of inability and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in increasingly Western countries.
For it seems that it is expanding more and more in the vast masses of the population of beliefs than that their actions should be the same as the thoughts of the so far popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already overcome its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to remove ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in the immediate electoral “resistances” or in unexpected changes in collective sentiments in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of Labour in the UK, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps it has something to do with the victory of the right-wing in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever-increasing difficulties to understand, i.e. to represent, which, not from today, is formed in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is re-strengthening, growing, potentially too cloudy.
Before this, it would be exaggeration to speak of a permanent ‘mass rebellion’.
But we can’t say that it means having your eyes open.
Super adhesive to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walking on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various US research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a stokilogram body stuck on a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipes.
«The base of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes laid as an organized spaget pile» explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists inspired themselves with the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these plazas and at the same time ‘it will simply peel away from the wall’ explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dayton.
“This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive” adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk around walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
So far, no super heroes.
Further research - Also the University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to researching new adhesives.
In one article of the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scientists presented a glue formed from microfibre as a hair that cleans itself from dust by moving through the surface to keep the perfect grip.
Medication: never with juice
Watch out for gradient, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are mainly consumed in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion is changing, or reducing efficiency with serious health consequences.
In order for David Bailey, a professor at Western Ontario University in London, to emphasize the risks of juices both finished and fresh combined with the consumption of certain drugs, at the currently on-going 263th American Chemical Society National Meetting in Philadelphia raises a new alarm: just one glass of Cmax, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to annul their beneficial effects and expose the health of patients to risk.
Grep juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines, and neurological drugs.
This was reported by the Italian Medical Agency in the Information Bulletin two years ago, and incited doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEXT GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects that are suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
From here, the challenge of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: “Such discoveries will usually immediately be addressed to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for drugs.
So, always read the illustrative tickets of the medicines you get and if you encounter something unclear, don’t be concerned, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” emphasized an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics regarding the foreign, economic and political actions of the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, on the days when Enron collapsed, Krugman predicted in one comment published in the New York Times that the second event would, in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States, be much more important than the first.
The prediction, which caused little controversy and which for years was charged to him, but which turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and shocked at the speed of collapses like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is of great importance, but also a popularizer who has a “very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of Bush’s liberalist administration”.
Open Office, we have the third edition of the Anti-Microsoft package
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows a wide audience with various innovations: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window will be added another, far more significant, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Emphasis is also placed on working with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft file extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
The special features of some models are interesting, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphic design model and maintain the original look of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create documents -PDF hybrids - that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts with changes, in the text program, each co-worker is assigned one color to comments to make the identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to transfer some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should rebuild the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, was added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the operating Linux system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent home or at the workplace upon request.
And if the subject of free-of-charge can be a drag to expand in households, it is the business area of the Open Office package that is betting a lot, and it can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version it is possible that this anticipated number can be exceeded.
Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and the winner of the T-shirt of the best mountainer.
The report quoted the pages of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer at Ceru, the third generation Epoch, after the Italians Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he of Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohla fall into those that have been performed in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chateauy-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positive at Ceru, Austria will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The Third-Generation Kohla positive report is confirmed by French anti-doping agency chief Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed about the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26-year-old Austrian was ranked on the podiums behind Spain’s Carlos Sastr and American Cadel Evans, and he also won the top-ranked t-shirt.
IMIGRANTI: NEW YORK TIMES WAITS, IS ITALIE RASIST?
Italy, as a country of emigrants, has only been transformed into a preferred target of immigrants, accepted with resistance.
It turns a beautiful country into a nation of racists? Thus, in one long article, the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of cookies.
This case makes it visible what the New York Times define - the paradox of the north -: the northern regions are at the same time those who register - more integration and more work - but also the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League -
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to inhibit immigration and facilitate the eviction of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
A tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: ‘Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinal, asked the state and church to work together to defeat racism.
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, trade unions for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“Jew has already reached such dimensions that all classes of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices their families would have to bear,” explains Sunia’s study manager Laura Mariani, “in this city, a great demand from students has deformed the market in such a way that it has sparked a process of price rise that has also spread to residents.”
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without limited rent, associated leases.
For Sunji there is a need for exceptional intervention, which could regulate prices thanks to the revision of taxes.
Looking at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for one bed of about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (zone Bande Nere) through a medium value of 800 (zone of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (zone of Vittoria).
In Florence there is one bed on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome, in central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single bed) in zones near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for the single room of Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are required for the bed, for the room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
At Bari, they want €250 per bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have more impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rent for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally one further anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want after foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of Multiplex.
“The city without cinema is like a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosals in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
It often disappears with memories, ‘it’s as if we lost a friend, a friend we shared a bit of the journey with and a lot of emotions’, the director of the New Paradise Cinema, a film that won the Torontoor Oscar 20 years ago and the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes, and who told the poetry of one village cinema and sadness about the way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years closed the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional tip, and the highest bill paid the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torina, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures is Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first one responsible for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multisals: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian procedure has evolved irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anecu, “it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing will survive, because when one cinema closes in the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let’s not even talk about insufficient subsidies to the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed per year.\"
An interesting case is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find a starting point by signing the protocol between the village and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centers and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief in favour of operators and benefits to the public regarding mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and at some parking lots.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by implementing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to establish the “New Paradiso Cinema”, which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I’ve been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I’m going through the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in the street of Nazionale, where I’ve shared so much emotion so that I don’t have to look at the signs of blackened dust, I turn to the other side.”
Connection between the politician and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
Gioie Tauro’s mayor was willing to modify the city’s office’s election according to the interests of the Piromalli group.
The allegations against the Mafia in Calabria against Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarn Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning due to external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, a deputy chief, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, convicted of paying 10 million euros.
“They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense,” state officials wrote when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay a consultation to Piromalli’s lawyer.
“So the Mafia group would allow the judges to officially enter the city’s authorities and make it easier to control and manage public administration.”
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that “secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworlds are a lot in his region: “There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'andranghets, heroes who are still immaculate -
The prisons of this morning follow the arrest of July last year, which police showed that the Piromalli Mafia group had received a final intervention.
Since the end of April last year, the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was the supposed link between organised crime and local administration - local politicians have been deprived of functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, was elected at the time of dissolution by the head of the right-center coalition after the narrower election in May.
He shouted about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called to the responsibility of Interior Minister Marc Minniti at the time and accused him of falling asleep for political reasons, but the judges in the prison order this morning explain that the Mafia group had grown so far as to ask for a change in the A3 motorway project.
From the other hearings ordered against Dal Torrio, the public prosecutors write, it was revealed that the willingness to move the claims of an entrepreneur, representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration choices to the interests of the mafia group.
When energy is born of waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now beginning to be discovered by major world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of the colossals such as Chevron are now trying to pull their hands on these resources.
The possibility of creating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s research has increased in context with the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil decreased around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went side by side, but now an environmental organization and a new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 said that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the wave movement of the seas.
This amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
In addition, there are also currents and tides and tides.
Giants are attacking.
The company that was planting on sea energy was Energis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” said a spokesperson for one company that is connected to the United States’ oil wheel, the Wall Street Journal’s economic daily newspaper, “and they are thinking about how to work with us.”
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that the US continues to mine oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, they track the footprint of marine energy and Verdant Power Inc. from New York City and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, show a growing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in the beginning because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
For greater energy production, however, technology must be used with greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of struggles that are intertwined with each other.
The force of the waves, which moves with the fights up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these beats.
Pressure spins a turbine that delivers energy to the generator.
Energy reaches the shore of underwater cables.
So far, there are four facilities of this type waiting only for federal approval in the project phase, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power already produces energy for the shopping mall and parking by using six submarine turbines in East River, New York.
The movement of water during the tide and outflow causes the turn of the turbines, which feeds the generator through this rotating motion.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of tide and outflow, they say in the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although this is an incoherent factor, the tides and outflows are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It was in the power supply and outflow that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and predicted up to $35 million in 2009.
