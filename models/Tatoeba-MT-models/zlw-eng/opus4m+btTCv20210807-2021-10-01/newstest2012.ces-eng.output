The Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal a paragraph under the amendment of the criminal code, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Julia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would open the way for the liberation of the prisoner-expressor, was rejected by MEPs in the second reading of a proposal to mitigate penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly unfavorable agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final, the appeal of the convicted person is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the judgment as the political revenge of the regime, the suspicion of the bias of the court provoked a trial even in the West.
The proposal for paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, to be supported by 147 Members in the vote.
A total of 226 votes were required for its approval.
Libyan victory
The story of Libyan liberation or Libyan rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it is after the war.
We have to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but it is whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to Sharia's customary law and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, for the hand is mutilated for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible disembarkation from faith awaits execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator’s person, the company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
In Libya, there will be an order that we cannot imagine and which we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor the objectively best, and it probably would not be suitable for the change just mentioned by the Libyans.
In fact, it’s strange that Islamic fighters have taken credit from infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view, a general from America was not led by NATO raids, but by Allah, whose greatness was celebrated in every leading intervention.
So when the winners are sought in Libya, the west is not among them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the political ally in the person of the dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
Following recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
This is why the problem of evicting the Crusaders is eliminated by the locals.
But will they have black gold without occupying the oil company?
Perhaps they will not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the selfless protection of human rights.
So unless your followers of the Sharia law fail to do so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in search of investors.
The statistical storm was overflowing across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnantly stagnated, Germany and France are growing.
The debt market is breaking records today.
Investors no longer only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
The two countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original figures were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated on a quarterly basis and, according to the Czech Republic, confirmed the trend of gradually slowing the growth in economic performance.
The results are worse than analysts’ estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy has grown 1.5% this year, but has stagnated on an intermediate basis.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, increased by 0.5%.
Both the euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical boundaries.
The problems also begin to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The yields for Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is getting worse.
From Germany, the vote is that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates 200 million
Football team did the toughest job of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Peter Jiráček, she won 1:0.
Czech football, with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended the luxury advantage of home retaliation and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progress match in a detailed reportage.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech team also won the lucky 1:0 in Černá Hora and celebrates the progress of the European Championship thanks to the domestic defeat at the end, the great Czech and hero Jeráček.
Blacks were put under pressure in the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech whole.
The game was fought by Damjanovich and Vučič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championship next year, and there will also be a prize of about 200 million crowns at the home football house.
A lot of fighting football has been played since the beginning of the minutes.
Both teams were hardly involved in the combination and played mostly around the halving line.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense accurately turned away.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
Created a Live Shield
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their country's support for the nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the object on Tuesday and called for the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students at the universities in Isfahan, Iran, have created a living shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center in which uranium is being processed.
They show that they are ready to defend the nuclear program of their country with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) said in a recent report that Iran has apparently stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isphahan nuclear facility and called for the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting Iran's nuclear programme as much as possible, the Israeli press said, in addition to the Isphahan center, would also target the Natanz facility in which uranium is enriched.
Obese baby's meal: does not eat and eat smoked
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, with an excess weight of 9% of schoolchildren and obese being 5 percent of children.
Obese children usually come from unhealthy families, as shown by a recent survey.
Again, it turns out how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows, and the patterns in which it is surrounded.
For example, on tables in obese children, smokeds appear up to half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried chips had at dinner the day before the research associated with an awareness event called Obesity is not more than 19 percent obese.
In fat families, it is also not a habit of sporting, which is true of most families of schoolchildren today - only 15 percent of children replied that their parents will at least once a week find time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year’s school year and was attended by nearly 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity event, it is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 school students from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
Proper eating and enough movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
For example, only half of those surveyed said that she ate five times a day in breakfast-breakfast-dinner-supper, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition, sounds one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and evening smoked
Experts point out that for healthy development there are significant and relative details, such as regular family breakfast times.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats alone.
And the worst thing was to find out that in the tenth of households it is not at all eaten at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy chips are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemons every day (70 percent).
Although he regularly sports more than 40 percent of children surveyed, his parents had less than half the result - 15 percent.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build on the options offered by their own diet according to their own taste and their own opinion.
The health preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition.
Among their favorite foods are a lot of flour, meaty and sweet dishes.
“There is a great popularity of sweet lemons, particularly,” the survey’s final report states.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta was won just above the poultry.
Children, however, practically did not want any dandruff, and there is also a low popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes.
A tendency to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
“There is no coincidence in the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire at the end of the Obezita lecture, in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition has occurred,” according to the results of the project.
For example, it was great for sweet drinks, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also more often checked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet foods and breads.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, says the professor
In an introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was a lot of it in the opening hours.
I didn't know what to do next.
Lectures of three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes to the place.
And it'll be worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it’s really “found”
This time we discussed with Director Alenka (not the only boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly proportional figure.
And such is the vast majority.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's a boy figure with no real curves, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to visually soften the wide shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We have received such tips as Jennifer Lopez, the larger breasts and the hips and the narrow waist, the figure to emphasize and not to dress very appealingly at the same time.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirts or trousers do not really fit, then it is worth being sewn at least one such piece on a personal basis.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly falling clothes are not paid.
In a tailor-made dress, you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves you, summarizes, stops in your waist and so on.
In turn, a boy figure can afford to wear clothes with quilting, applications, embroidery or picking.
There’s a lot of information and types of characters, of course, so I’m happy to have all the information in my head for a week.
And I'm still afraid that because of the homework, it's up to me.
Each of the courses received an assigned celebrity, to be invented by two outfits: day and evening.
We have to take into account the current look, the fashion style of the given personality and the character type.
I’ll wear Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria’s Secret campaign.
In the spirit of joy, for me personally certainly better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained perhaps a hundred kilos (please, please, in terms of exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print and then graphicly process it.
Moodyboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relation to graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for specific entries such as handbag trends, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday’s lecture, packed with information about the character types, was attended by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Humiliated, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a clever stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
In this case, variability is crucial.
For example, such a trenchcoat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically through jeans and a T-shirt like a jacket, but you can also dress it on a bare body, cover a boat and take a picture of it as a dress.
Or just pull out the sleeves or collars and immediately the whole look looks different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But I appreciated the following advice: ‘You need to know the rules perfectly.’
“Then you can start breaking them,” said James.
Finally, I understand why we are crushing all the lessons we can combine with, why, when we see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have much more clothes prepared than how many can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be prepared - to set - at least 15.
And also that in the photo of clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckda quite differently than in fact.
So we have to count on that when we create the outfit.
That the image and style make up to half the success, confirmed to us by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not just a miraculous singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the access to the use of stylists' services is colder.
Even familiar faces often consider him useless (it is enough that I know something, what I look like in it is secondary).
And if someone has already created styling from us, then we have to count on him to give us a very different (less) size than he really is.
Then it’s nothing but to Google and find out if the boulevard has written about the celebrity’s bluishing/deeping and the like.
On Sunday, both Honza and Mario put us on the heart that it was not enough for a stylist to orient himself in fashion and to be able to put together a outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he wears, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not to run away, to stand up for your opinion.
“When a manager orders you to clean up her wardrobe and fill her with nice pieces, you can’t throw her out of the closet and tell her, for God’s sake, that’s terrible.”
“Find there at least a few things you will praise and recommend what they can be worn for,” Mario says.
He also showed us specifically what everything must contain the so-called “cookie”, or a bag on the square.
It's the one you turn on around your waist and you have all the necessary support.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair rollers or pins, there is also a silicone thread (with it, the stylist helps in shooting products such as handbags or hats), special clips that we turn back on the clothes if it is larger (pindle or other clamps are not permissible, would destroy clothes), or a shirt.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to fit the shoes correctly.
Even when shooting in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
So we glued and glued.
We must not touch or touch our feet so that they do not accidentally damage them.
There is really a need for skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservations.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
I’m getting more and more clear that dedicated to professional styling isn’t really a pink set walk, no matter who wants what.
Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Reviews
Originally, carefree driving turns into a routine morning road to the neck because of a series of completely unnecessary laidations.
The ambition has largely been fulfilled, but nothing is valid when no one apparently wanted to do anything extra.
A new part with the subtitle The Run woke up before the release of high expectations.
He promised that Need for Speed would move a bit in a new direction again, and from playable demonstrations it would seem like a game that would not have to be in the action racing genre.
We were also curious about how the embedded passages will fall, in which the main hero will get out of the car and take place after his own.
However, as with the NFS series, many are a little different than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole has been pulling down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series for more than a few years.
So they are not mistakes, but rather manifestations of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are brought into the story, whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York City.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than 50 races.
From this it follows that each race goes on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t have a moment of feeling that the game would still offer the same thing.
Some of the environments are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-class.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains works visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are from time to time stamped with some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you will get caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be filled with a lava.
In addition, individual races are quite well placed behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
So for a while, you are trying to overtake the desired number of opponents (in essence, a classic race), then you are chasing the time (a classic fight with stopwatches) and then waiting for you, for example, a duel with a single opponent.
This will be done from time to time by the police, who will make all your efforts even more difficult.
The new one is passages outside the car.
Rather, it’s just such an interactive animation, when Jack usually runs away from someone and you need to help him by printing the right buttons at the right times.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (especially three).
As a result, it is for the benefit of a thing, because this element does not have the chance to become annoying, and in the context of the above-mentioned, it is thus one of the elements that amplify the game.
The driving model goes in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that in today’s time it’s definitely not who else, but it can’t be said that it would be a bad thing.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-driven racing of the driving model here still suits quite well, even though we could find better in competition.
So then everything is perfectly fine.
However, problems begin to arise after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer very good.
We don’t expect this type of game to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you don’t have the slightest idea of how your car will behave in front of virtually any impact on any object, then it’s probably not all right.
Typically, when driving or passing cars in normal operation, you will sometimes only be able to bite each other slightly, but sometimes in almost the same situation your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even attack.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn’t matter especially, but it will make you feel reliable.
Restarts are solved so that if you break or go far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
There are only five restarts available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
It is rather such a tool in the event that something does not work, than that you can rely specifically on it.
But sometimes the restarts won’t help, they’ll be solved when it’s necessary to learn the section of the memory race.
The big downside of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you will not simply fit into them.
Other times you will meet in a given place - civilian - cars always in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This will be particularly exciting in situations where you can see the opponent passing in front of you between two opposing cars, while when you get there, the cars are in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
It doesn’t matter when you reach them, because it’s “calculated” so that the situation always happens just before your nose.
Competitors also have another advantage.
Throughout the gameplay you will encounter several places where, again regardless of the time, always precedes the same opponent in the same place.
Most of the time, it hits the end of the game on a long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent must come in front of you at any cost.
When he's driving in front of you, you're getting a lot worse about the anti-cars, so you're going to get a couple of times there.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-like, but the execution is so obvious that it will dissatisfied you reliably quickly.
And it’s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and places are so actionable that sometimes you literally don’t keep track of where it flies.
And basically, it doesn’t matter if it’s due to a concept with 50 unique tracks, sorting races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to replace cars during races.
You need to pay attention to petrol pumps at the road, because it is there that you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you will be enough with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporters are suitable for urban areas, strong U.S. boroughs on straight highways and exotic supersports on technical driving, for example, along clogged mountain roads.
With the main story mode, both hand in hand and fashion of challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common to challenges and storytelling.
Different objects are unlocked for obtaining a higher level of the driver: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also reconnected to Autolog’s online feature, which compares your achievements with other players and provides additional community features.
One of the other hard-to-understanders is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the underground tunnel (let's) where you want it in the dark by the tracks (be).
On the tachometer, the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (let's) flash, and in that from behind, the set of subways will be attached and will uncompromisingly scrap you.
In the editor's office, we're probably going to have a few days to talk about whether there's really no one else who's really thinking about the game, or whether the authors think we're such a big fool.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in several cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more eccentric moments the shooting decreases, in some cases quite tragically.
This is especially true of storms with a larger number of participants, where smooth shooting would no longer be valid for you.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to enjoy the widest possible range of younger audiences, a soundtrack was created from the category “every dog has a different village”, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, the game is probably not going to be bought by someone.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so desperate.
If the game were to avoid unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game works undeservedly.
The fun is definitely good, but be prepared for the mistakes to shake you into the eyes with the power of airport spotlights.

EU Ambassador Vice-President:
Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Euroskeptics
The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between institutions.
“I didn’t expect it to be such a tough war.”
“It will take five or six years for the situation to calm down, calm down, and before all players get used to their new roles,” the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To the extent that she takes her motto “Intelligiblely and openly about Europe” seriously, she has already shown in the first part of the lecture, when she was able to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could envy a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the UK.
Vicen also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye:
“At first, there was criticism that he was indiscriminate, that he was a gray official, that he could not perform any role, and I have to say that all of them had a breath that he had performed well,” he said.
“He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate well with them, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.”
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: ‘Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call, i.e. as an important step towards unifying and greater EU policy legibility towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban me.
Vicen also addressed the agenda that the European Council lived, lived and would live in the near future.
The Czech presiding president called it a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
At that time, the fall of the government was described as a great negativum, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very urgent.
In the words of the Ambassador, the \"frakt frmol\" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that has been addressed to this day.
In addition, a new seven-year Union budget is still to be approved, which is very complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and cost-effective, which sectors will have the advantage of which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: ‘About Europe intelligiblely’
“I really don’t like ugly shortcuts, strange words, an insult that no one understands.
How should a citizen understand that there are no curvy or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that someone really has to forbid us of cheeses.
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs to European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe.
According to the ambassador, Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice the negatives rather than the positives of things.
In addition, she is sorry for the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
She said there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
“Believe me that when the Pole and the Hungarian come to me and the Slovak is approaching, the French man next to me will say, ‘Hey, what are you meeting there, what your Visegrad four are doing again, and it doesn’t look so excited about it at all.’
In the future of the Union, Vice-Vicens expect, in particular, new tough rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
As a very real concept, he sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new European Federation.
“We have euro area countries and countries standing outside the euro area.”
“We have Schengen area, we have already an enhanced cooperation institute”
For the first time, it was said that only the countries they want and those who do not want should cooperate, let them stand still.
“These institutes will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe,” Vicen said.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the Union are to be discussed between all Member States, not just between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM innovator begins its second century
If someone were looking for a word that most accurately expresses IBM’s strategy, it would probably be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is seen as very contemporary, and yet it has been hundreds of years since its founding.
The foundation of this long-term was laid by the first head of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already struck the slogan that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan, “Think,” became the print around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of the internal magazine that began in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to do even more in the second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson took care of his employees in the 1930s, as well as Bata in the Czech Republic, as one of the first American employees had paid leave, insurance from the employer, plus elegant employee uniforms, and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
Since the beginning, the company has been brilliant in extracting talents - as one of the world's first companies has abolished any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, led by IBM, will be replaced by a woman, Virginia Rometta.
She has been in IBM for 30 years, still in charge of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called pits, online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
An institution with a good name
The firm position in the business is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or \"Great Blue\" - has grown into one of the world's largest companies because of its logo in the United States.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents from all U.S. tech companies and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include ATM, credit card, financial swap, barcode, or Lisbon.
IBM has become the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple) this year, when it overtakes Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
View Forward
Not all products and innovations have hit the taste of customers and times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally travel to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they don't work, they leave.
Unlike a competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s sales are the largest in service, and after about a fifth it is made up of software and hardware.
In 1990, he was the most powerful hardware representative with more than half the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, and has invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies during the same time.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time in the world was overflowing.
IBM acts by reference to its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis intact.
IBM stock prices have increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate password is to change everything, but not its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM history: From cheese slicer to flight to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a century ago, originally known as the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over the name only in 1924 - it was originally a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM gave the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as the famous \"squirrels,\" i.e. hours recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company’s Supervisory Board by 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of the rival company, to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed IBM's founders - on Watson's ideas, an unbeatable corporate culture and identity are built so far.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began to produce and sell all kinds of business machines - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years, Watson’s head of business doubled its turnover to $9 million and began an extensive expansion of the company into all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior, almost forty years later in the boss's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM’s people and computers helped NASA drive flights to space at Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the man’s famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic “pee” that introduced the computer standard of the time, the IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of Chinese computers to Lenovo, on the contrary, it bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully devote itself to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years is the concept of a Smarter Planet, a smarter planet.
Its aim is to use technology intelligently in previously unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban management.
For the business area, IBM has recently launched the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
About an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave the donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtárová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtar (53) became not only a protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and come home.
But now she's not ready to wait, and she's set clear rules for her next life.
“Pepa can return home, but not as my partner,” Rychtárová explained.
When Darina Rychtárová granted Bartoš’s asylum in her home in the summer, she seemed to have no idea how her marriage would end.
Despite Iveta’s withdrawal from the River after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, reconciled with her husband’s relationship, and now she even gave him goodbye forever.
I don’t care who his wife is sleeping with.
If the Knight and Bartoš had only once broken up, his wife’s open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
“He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out.”
“But he will live it not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as the man with whom I have certain ties,” Rychtárová said, saying that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph, the fact that Darina closed his back door, he doesn't mind yet.
I respect my wife's decision -
“I’ll be with Iveta and I’m not going to change it.”
The wife set up a paper marriage and I respect it.
The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, property, buy -
“We’re having fun with Darina quite normally, it’s just that we don’t share the bed together,” he said.
If she finds a new love, she won’t be able to defend her.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where he’s going, who he’s going with, and if he has a friend.
“I know it’s my fault, I fall in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility,” Joseph said.
The worst women's habits: Do they apply to you?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female habits, as a rule, everyone in one is very quick to break out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you know yourself in the following lines, where there are some female habits that can perfectly dissipate blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half tell you that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like shopping and bulking in discounts?
In your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least cut their shopping passion a little bit.
But tell me, which would resist just walking around the clothing stores, looking for well-falling tops, and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the cabin?
Even if it is a hobby for most women, it can become literally hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
I'm not too fat -
I need to lose at least 5 kilos - I should start exercising.
I like you at all -
Don't they remind you of these sentences?
Right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
A stronger gender also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Wash windows, vacuum, wipe tiles, wipe dust, crush bathtubs - at least twice a week.
Do you tell your partner that he's been climbing a dirty foot on a clean tile, kids, that they've dirtyed a scratched sink, and they've covered a glass living wall, with which you've done so much to polish?
In the event that you are suffering from this “discipline”, try to realize that nothing is to be exaggerated, and order and purity should definitely not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Squirrel
-Those used trainers throw them in the basket -
“You’ll wear your old socks tomorrow, too.”
The wet cloth does not belong to the earth.
If you do this to your partner several times a day, know that you can reliably dial it.
Of course, you don’t mean anything wrong, you want to make sure everything is okay.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to dig so much into them.
Apologizing, Scratching
For some women there are also defamation, crushes, as well as insults and companionships against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a small harmless drb or a cliché here.
Your hand on your heart, it's your own for all women.
On the contrary, however, the gratings of the thickest grains that love and often crush, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous to their surroundings - mainly within the female work collective.
Jagr and Voráček helped with the Philadelphie win
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated in the NHL on Monday with two assists to win Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina’s ice and is once again at the forefront of Czech players’ productivity in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the best player in the game, took advantage of an overview of the nine-year-old star.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jágr’s partner Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jagr claimed that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
“Before the game, I told him that he would give a hattrick.
\"I felt it -
“Sometimes you feel that way,” explained Jágr, after which Giroux scored a goal from the first shot of Flyers.
A few days later, the team had a Czech footprint.
The bag won the Hurricanes disc and put it between the circles of the scorer Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, domestic player Patrick Dwyer reduced in weakness, but the introduction of the second part was once again Flyers.
In particular, Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored a third goal, and then re-slipped his shot in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
“I love to play with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the best three,” Jágr said.
“I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.”
\"I am glad of that -
I want to play on it -
“All those years in the NHL have been trying to play me, now it’s turning around,” said Jágr.
Carolina made the game a drama, Tuoma Ruutua’s goal, and again Dwyer, who was cast out of criminal shooting, got to the difference between one goal.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who ended up renumbering two into one.
-Excellently hit in our Pronger band -
“He pushed out the disc, I took the speed and (Read) went to a more distant bar.”
“I tried to hit him and I’m glad it worked out,” he described the last goal of the match from his point of view, Voráček.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not play against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to injuries at the upper part of the body.
Candiens lost their two-stroke lines next to an experienced beak and lost after a 2:3 penalt shot.
One of their raids was not transformed by Tomáš Plechanec.
Rather than losing points, a large-scale back row moor, with only five defenders playing the match.
It's bad -
“We played with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“But nothing can be done about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“The rotation behind the alternation was on us and we couldn’t resist.”
“We should have made the game easier, moving the puck out of our band.”
In this we had gaps,” added one of the defenders of P.K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondrej Pavelec contributed 30 Winnipeg interventions to the 5:2 win over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters shared the goal of the Jets, who interrupted the five-game series of losses.
How travel prices have developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recreation and Autotourist.
At the time, travel agencies sold only tours to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus traveled on a holiday to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility to travel to Yugoslavia was also possible, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were then very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that it was not possible for the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from that country, otherwise the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand the front overnight with a sleeping bag or have a good friend in a travel agency.
However, it was not won either.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for traveling to the West, was not granted to “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it was not possible to raise funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
However, by far the most often Czechs spent their vacation in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that Czechs bought and this habit still survives today.
Travelling Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While by 1989 holidays in the NDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that it was not possible to travel freely to the most popular Croatia for us at the moment until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the mid-1990s, visa requirements to neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn’t afford trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tours in parks in tents were sleeping, as our incomes did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the travel of Czechs at this time was the driving of their own food, canned, salami, etc., in order to save themselves.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally buy Western currency after many decades of age.
However, our standard of living and average wages increased, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours regularly since 1997 with charter air traffic services, thus making air trips thanks to the possibility to contract quantity discounts compared to the past incredibly reduced.
In the late 1990s, Czechs had visa-free access to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the United States, which continued to make our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred right in 2000, when due to considerable demand it was delivered from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exotic, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters are flying with Czech tourists to warm distant countries every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. cancelled a visa for Czech tourists and our country was definitely among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person on one foreign holiday for the first time in history.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but again threatens to pat
For almost five months, Czech football is without a president and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek, head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement according to which electoral order it will proceed.
Without it, he will not even vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest to lead Czech football has Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
Hašek resigned in June and called on colleagues to unite and find a strong person to lead football in the future.
However, in the era after Hashek, the football slid back to the pilgrimages between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This turned out to be the case on September 16th, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly went to the National House in Prague in Smíchov, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of election.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the assembly, whether it was merely a statutory representative or a full-fledged officer.
In this single point, there has been a partial consensus since then, which has been helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
The Executive Committee, which already at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, does not deal with anything else, has not made it too clear.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to rule out the option of a heel?
“The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model,” said one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association’s leadership.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is reportedly willing to make concessions to win a candidate who will win a higher sum of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side promotes the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the advantage in this percentage.
“But then it would have lost the meaning of the two previous rounds, this would have completely denied the two-chamber concept,” he understands the objections of the Moravian Party Freedom, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclik is somewhat surprised to do so, although it is estimated that the statutes of the electoral order are most suitable for all candidates.
I want to make a maximum choice according to the statutes.
“In order not to think of any representative nonsense as at the past General Assembly,” said Viktorie Pilsen, who is running for the first time and in his statements was primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburc, the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
“All passions will calm down the progress of today’s national team at the European Championship”
“Football will be on a happy wave, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate,” says Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of managing football at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restraintal.
“I hope in a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very split up.”
“It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations purposefully.”
“This can cause the general meeting to be blocked again.”
“But I hope that common sense will win,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place right in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality would be complete at all.
The air special, in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, among other things, did not fly from Prague due to a technical breach in the morning, looking for a replacement variant of how to transport part of the executive committee to the field of barrage retaliation.
Finally, there may be a decisive meeting at the Ministerial level, which may occur on Wednesday.
Education, Youth and Sports Minister Josef Dobeš would like to get the split parties inside the country’s strongest sports association to deal with.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to battle for president because he does not see a suitable candidate
If the head of footballers of Pilsen Tomáš Paclik had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have applied for a top position.
“If there is a quality adept, I fight for it and I don’t go to the election.”
“But in the current situation, no one like that has been found,” said ČTK Paclik.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, the woman of Paclik is motivated to try to avoid Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, on his way to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he would only remain in the role of the President until 2013, when the General Assembly is on the agenda.
In office, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected with football.
“I have spoken to some people who have come into consideration,”
“It was crazy to me when some said they didn’t even want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
“I want to change that view,” he said.
Paclík is now most concerned with Peltov’s connection with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the General Assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclik to stand in the presidency.
“If he had won, the current state would have been preserved and nothing in football would have moved forward.”
“In combination with Berbra’s support as a skilled trader, football would not benefit even more,” Paclik said.
He also points out that Pelt's name had been heard in the investigation of the corruption affair years ago, from which Pelt came out without punishment.
\"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring.\"
“And what we would also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclik, who also takes his previous statement with the view that he would “sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became president”
If Paclik triumphed on Thursday, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
There is also another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclik supported before the September General Meeting, which ended with the fiasco.
He (Pelta) would be the first to follow.
He has great abilities -
“I could imagine him as the head of representation.”
“But managerially, he couldn’t manage the association.
“I also don’t push my nose where I don’t know,” said Paclik, who in September raised much attention by being behind the appeal of the arbitration panel headed by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik says he'd be in charge of the association.
He refers to his skills from the management of private companies, since last summer he also heads Pilsen, who with his support in May celebrated the Premier League triumph.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to its particular cultivation.”
“To limit the influences of some of the interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commissions,” said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathies, for example, to the Spartan chief Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also consider the strengthening of FAČR’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political leaders for getting more money from lottery taxes into the sport.
“It is one of the key things that a new president should address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say on a level where the money goes,” he said.
As a burden, Paclik does not even take on his connection with the Pilsen club, even though he himself claims that the FACR president should be ‘over-side’.
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
It's not ideal -
“But I don’t see a sense of hypocritically transferring my shares to someone at the Pilsen club and coming back in a year and a half,” Paclik said.
Pelta promises new FACR statutes to rule out election pat
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of the election, the FAČR would have new statutes that would definitely exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jabloneckian functionalist is an optimist before the Thursday session in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election struggle will significantly dampen the potential success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that he would focus on representation and fundraising in case of election.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his ideas about football management and introduce himself in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect to know the president on Thursday.”
“It feels that it is high time for an association to lead,” says the man, who is associated primarily with the Jablonec club, but who has worked in Sparta for many years and the Executive Committee of the Union.
He also believes that he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that behind the current problems with choice is the euphoria that reigned during Ivan Hašek’s reign.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought,” he said.
“If they did not allow different interpretations, we had the president since September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the rework of the most important document of the civic association that he considered as an egg to delegates.
“If I become a President, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails.”
“It’s a fundamental thing we can’t be without,” Pelta says.
He’s still trying not to define himself against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knows well that his anti-candidacy would be his first vice-chairman.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclik for a long time, which on the other hand did not leave a dry thread on Pelt.
“There is something going on in football for over a year, he has already gained some successes.”
But his attacks were unworthy and many people were surprised by the election campaign.
“And so many of them now doubt his true character,” Pelta said in an address to the opponent, who said he was faithful to the proclamations he had announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the team.
It should be an interpretation of the football box.
“And I would also try to end all the affairs, starting with the case of the Bohemians or the hearings of last year’s corruption scandal,” he said.
“I would like to take a look at the negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure enough money for the whole football,” he said.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any staff cleaning.
“I’d have to first get acquainted with the fillings of individual employees,” he pointed to Strahov, where long-term uncontrollable nervousness prevails.
Despite today’s catastrophic scenarios accompanying the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday.
“If the only questionable point is how it will be elected in the third round, we will be able to move through it.”
“Football needs credibility, and that’s the only way he gets it by finally having his leader again,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before a possible decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FACR would start working hard under it
If the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected to the Thursday General Assembly by former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that he will start working hard in the event of his election.
It wants to promote systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by previous President Ivan Hašek.
As president, I want to focus on football as a whole.
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to representations, professional football, performance football to youth
“But I’m not saying that I would do everything myself,” Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech Republic.
“I am a team player and I want to share competence in the Executive Committee so that each of the members is dedicated to certain areas,” he said.
“And I’m going to hand out hard tasks to move football a mile ahead in every segment.”
“Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought he wouldn’t run again.
I know I do 20 hours a day.
“But I need to know that it’s going to make sense and that I won’t have people behind me who’ll keep throwing sticks under my feet and question every step of my own,” he explained.
“Many people told me I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up.”
“That’s a trust I can’t just throw away,” he said.
He said he was also motivated by the work he started with Hashek.
“In the last two years, a lot of work has been done, and I don’t want to throw it away now.”
“There are up-and-coming processes that need to be heard in a few years, and I don’t want anyone to stop them,” he said, concerned that in the event of another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the union could go back to the time before Hashek.
“I believe in systematicity, and that’s something Mirek Pelta, in my opinion, does not know.”
“There are people behind him who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones.”
“I can blame a lot of things, but certainly not that I’m partying to someone.”
I am trying to be objective -
“I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be well, not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also said he would be a Czech president.
“Although some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
For example, it is time to think about the fact that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go into the first league -
“There would not be such a situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia,” Rajchl said.
As the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclik also participated in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
“But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees clear achievements behind me,” Rajchl said, who considers it his successes to save tens of millions of crowns in unfavorable contracts, arrangement of television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the contrary, he takes the blame for not pulling the union for one rope.
While Pelt claims to be “disqualified” to return trust to Czech football, the second of Paclik’s opponents considers him a strong candidate who has a football deal to offer.
No one can doubt that he has done a great job in Pilsen this year.
“If he were elected, he would probably continue to do the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions.”
“He wouldn’t want to twist it in his favor,” Rajchl said.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
The Ufona, the lavish pool in Budapest: Those who travel in Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after a tour of cities or travel to let their tired legs rest in thermal spas.
The book will show you where the wellness is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a discovery trip in the past one and a half years, she could not miss her luggage: her swimwear.
Lying a hint on the water, she looked up into the artistically shaped domes, sailed opposite the marble putti (the characters of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pool.
If some of the swimming pool liked her, she brought her into her notebook - even with remarkable details about the way in which the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architecture historian Meder and are now featured in his recently published book, Badefreuden: Folk swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of swimming pools in Schwarzwald, the “hard core of concrete buildings” in Taunus.
13 countries led by her “Road behind the most unusual spas in Central Europe”: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a true enthusiasm of swimming culture.
With sport, it's not too much, says Meder - it's something else in the water.
To anger is only that fanding needs to satisfy with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the runners for health can inhale the blemish smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful shimmering of birds in the park.
“One day I asked why swimming pools must always be so glamorous,” said Ms Meder, living in Vienna.
“So I started collecting nice swimming pools.”
Water level doubles architecture
Swimming in the jump pool and essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so large that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be a true shepherd for the eyes: ‘The place of the floor has a man in the spa water level’
It is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building.
Everything is optically doubled: high arches, colorful stoves, jump board.
The Small Format Image Volume -Badefreuden - provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical oasis wellnes - but above all, the desire to jump into blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of the swimming pools, Mrs. Meder, in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful healing spas, as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spas in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal spas, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jaszberény).
In contrast, many heated swimming pools under the open sky in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful look. While a man has an entire city in the eyes of the Chursian indoor swimming pool, he can look at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam baths there is a window from which it is possible to watch the traffic on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Ötztal Aquapark looks like ufo, which has just landed in the Alps.
From the three open basins in the winter, the steam rises while in the background of the Ötztalu mountain lies to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool collector, Mrs. Meder smelled chlorine into the flu.
Many thermal baths are felt in sulphur, in the Árpada spas in Bekescsaba, Hungary, it odors after heating oil to the point that one hardly believes that he got into a spa.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkalial hydrocarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits spoil on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, architect Dušan Jurkovič designed spas were closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the falling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how much weed was growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three stages of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanian elements that originate from the time of its creation in 1844, but also the Moorish Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for the swimming pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already some kind of performance, connecting such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex,” says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank to examine commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the company’s chief wants to get the consequences out of it.
Hamburg - Hotel
For federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even ask Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to step out of this trade because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of a consumer foodwatch organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows that the stakes on global commodity exchanges are driving prices up and banks are complicit in the world’s hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act the same way.
Initially, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that participants in the capital market interested in high-risk trades have dissociated from supply and demand - and have made profits on the account of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: He promised that he would check out the extracts and say that no trade was worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank being placed at stake.
According to the SPIEGEL ONLINE information, the international working group controls the extracts from the Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the inspection will be closed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board - along with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank’s leaders want to tell us what the consequences will be.
At the end there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works self-help in his image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report, strengthening its criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how the bank is now harming the general well-being.”
Let Ackermann, as the highest banking lobbyist, fulfill his duties.
“Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items for which money is used for bets on food prices,” Bode said.
Whether Mr. Ackermann is a hunger sufferer or Deutsche Bank's reputation
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the group's boss would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from the disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And the possible losses do not need to worry - with it should eventually be dealt with by his successor.
Every other investment in raw materials would say
Foodwatch is trying to keep a lot of pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have been involved in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, he published a Bode survey in which 1001 people were asked by the Forsa Institute on November 7 and 8.
It is estimated that 11% believe Deutsche Bank offers investments that are associated with bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: each other would have declared all the investments for which money is flowing into speculation with raw materials as a result of the survey.
43% would warn a well-known bank, 49% said they would think about denouncing their account and move to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy ending: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
It is now open again as an exhibition house.
When it is hot for modern post-war architecture, for bright forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an appropriate and famous example.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and high-rise steel and glass construction.
The building is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
The architect was famous for building the Austrian pavilion during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key made by the secondary construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous.
As a temporary exhibition building designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition, it was placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), renovated and opened the 20th century Museum in 1962 - it was named \"The House of the 20th Century\" -
However, the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the present art reached a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion has been renovated, now bearing the name ‘The House of the 21st Century’, and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere, was launched.
Husslein-Arco, a promoted art historian with a prominent career, i.e., in the youth of the figure skater, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museum and as the founding director of the Musea Moderna Salzburg, asserted a strong reconstruction in politicians and memorials, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Obruba should be exhibited by the same name foundation, a cafe and bookstore should be created, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was an ideal cast.
Not only did he renovate and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Schwanzer, and the pavilion was an extremely important place for him, where he looked at the exhibitions early every weekend.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which, when moved to Vienna and changed its use, lost its generosity and ease.
In the current reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was a “captul for energy,” says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade have been replaced, used glass fiber reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cooling bridges-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled ceilings canned.
The two underground floors provided a place for new use, a flooded lighting channel between the building and the street procures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
The cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
All this is under the strict supervision of the Memorial Office and the low budget.
“There must have been found material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental office,” says Krischanitz, pointing to a broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult to say that it was with the pavilion, “who came here from Brussels,” said Krischanitz, a typical “Drop-in-the-City-History” recently.
Such architecture is always in the wrong place, and yet it wants to “encourage proper self-confidence”
In this case, however, the house of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because there was an urbanly happy coincidence: In the circle around Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed - Urban District near the Main Station - with office and residential houses is created.
And perhaps there will still be another lucky coincidence: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as he hears them, is already dealing with the town’s neighborhood at the Schweizer Garten.
The track plans a package for the winter crisis in a million
The track has been rinsing a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn spends more than 70 million euros this year, according to a report in the newspaper.
Newspapers - Bild - brought a preliminary report, citing an internal group plan, that it was estimated that by 2015 a total of around 300 million euros were expected.
It is said that better use of trains and railway networks is also to be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
It is said that it is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external staff to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway installations and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for operation of the necessary switches during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting with government and industry officials about train outages and delays during this winter.
In the last winter period, the passenger transport track had significant problems, because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, there was a lack of reserves.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, there is a delay for ICE trains.
For years, the track has also failed to allow ICE trains to be checked more often when a ICE train at the Köln Main Station was destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the United States
Following the upheaval around Chief Josef Ackermann, there are new traumas in the U.S.: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of compensation there.
As if the problems at home were no longer enough, Deutsche Bank has settled a giant in his past in the U.S.: Frankfurt institutions are paying $145 million in compensation proceedings to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks in the course of the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage letters.
The financial market regulator of the NCUA calculates a number of large banks that have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that the risks have probably reduced.
In the course of the crisis, such papers were largely lost to the value, and the banks fell into the abyss with them.
“We are pleased that we could solve the issue without having to force the parties to come to court,” Deutsche Bank spokesperson in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt by settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the accompaniment of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is competent for cooperative banks in the United States and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of dollars of damage.
The settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also turned to other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
In doubtful mortgage letters, this is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble broke down in 2007, a number of financial companies became fatal.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Mehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the events occurred a few years ago, now banks are blowing in front of a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous actions in order to obtain redress or to affect errors.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
According to 18 international large banks, two U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage trades of about $200 billion had a disadvantage.
Deutsche Bank also faces FHFA’s lawsuit, with more trades worth about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for “substantial losses” without giving an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 Billion
The Buffett financial guru invests heavily in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Warren Buffett has always said he will not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
However, he now read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM was offering services in particular and acquiring computer systems for IT-department of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a fit for knights in the financial world.
As a result, it can be called the parent IT rock of IBM now “Sir IBM”
For Buffett has revealed at the US economic radio station CNBC that he has purchased US$10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a proportion of 5.5%.
Buffett says IBM didn't know anything about his involvement.
He praised management, which he tried during the economic crisis even for proper returns.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett said.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT-services such as the operation of computing centers.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneers also offer software and advice as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
It claims to invest only in companies whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached the freight railway, after the lubricant manufacturers or after machine products.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns, alongside about 80 of its own subsidiaries, also shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over Berkshire Hathaway, a small textile company in the 1960s, and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
But his way of life is modest.
Therefore, it is a iconic figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname \"Oracle of Omaha\" (The Miracle of Omaha)
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s stocks increased by one percent before the stock exchange started.
\"Big Blue - as IBM is also called, has a total cost of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered to be the most valuable technology companies in the world with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to come in.
Founder Bill Gates is a friend of his.
The threat is tangible
Following the discovery of the “Bunks in Zwickau”, Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now reliving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was addressed in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For for many German Turks, the horror that has long been considered dead comes back: There has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background since the Mölln attacks in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993.
There has never been a doubt about xenophobia in Germany.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a range whose dimension cannot be overseen for a long time.
The bloody ideology relives - headlines of the Internet edition of Turkish newspapers - Haberturk -
On the other hand, the “Sabah” newspaper emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Service and fears that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded with caution: It remembered the weekend with silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, remembered the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
As a shelf, several Turkish media outlets report: “The Gift of Germany to the 50s is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform “Haber X”, which refers to the background of the murderous series.
Also, the issue of the letter, Hürriyet, cannot be taken for Germany so that it does not carry out this connection of thought.
It begins to smell - the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci sounds.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany’s restoration were murdered.
The most critical is discussed in German Internet forums by the police and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
In this way, many are at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: ‘If activity continues so superficially, there will be nothing left for immigrants but their own defence and armedness.’
This will be the best self-defense.
“On the quality of clarification and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends the internal peace in Germany,” writes Selen.
What it means, if internal peace is threatened in Germany, is explained by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the burning site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown to the living Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks on the Turkish side made a more visible feeling of reciprocity.
Do not repeat mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at that time, German policy failures after the assassinations were criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After a grievous attack in Solingen, he sent a pityful telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent himself at a sad ceremony in Köln by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what charges the Turkish people had handed over.
It is as if the value of a man is measured according to the amount of his taxes.
The current news of Turkish media shows once again how profound the distrust of many German Turks in the local state-law system is.
In addition to seeking extensive clarification and a new evaluation of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Skandal banka u Curyšské Lake
Europe’s most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis, and since then it has flown from one crisis to another.
Now it's got to be compared to some German.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the head of the management of the Federal Bank in July, he became known to enter almost the same spectacular new job in 2013: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed the public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and said friendly notes to future colleagues.
- Die UBS has achieved turnover -
I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.
But it was clear in September that everything would go differently.
A UBS dealer has bypassed all the bank’s security systems and has wasted around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been burned, and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber bank has been allowed to advise since February 2012.
And the presidency of the board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
It will be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker and would certainly need time to work.
At the same time, he will take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which just once again proved that he deserves the title “Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe”
For UBS is, on the other hand, huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager - and it has been clashing for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, will not be saved by the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid, but also smart asset manager combines with ambitious goals: it also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
This is how UBS 2007 managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank to the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker and later long-time professor of banking at Zurich Hans Geiger says: “I have always introduced UBS to my students as a model of a good bank at the time.
“From today’s point of view, one asks, ‘How could I have been so wrong?’
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first seen that something went wrong in the UBS.
Surprisingly, in the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the head of the Board of Directors, was considered to be a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, I knew why he left.
The investment division of the bank has wasted Subprime and had to write off billions.
To keep it going, UBS has announced an increase in capital of a really 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, but such as she would have recently covered her nose: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that a person did not even know its name.
But it was just the first impact.
This developed worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood up due to its faulty investments in the financial crisis against the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank has purchased tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs to the mandatory exchangeable bonds for which it could have become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was stunned - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such a large bank in its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland’s economy (see picture).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” bank expert Geiger said.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with America and demonstrated a willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, as far as possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of unwarranted profits from these trades, including a penalty charge.
This led to UBS more or less openly that it helped cut taxes.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the sacrament of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it was before.
It was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board.
And the exodus of customer money.
In the course of several months, the bank has lost credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and asset management to help reduce taxes.
And just as it calmed down a little again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate business anabasis came: The only dealer wasted €1.7 billion before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, it’s probably still not the case.
“Adoli’s case may have found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz Professor of Finance at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of the large German bank is also sure: “The problem of UBS is that it does not manage risk control.”
In fact, it was precisely the idea of caution with which Swiss bankers took a long time to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - also on this side the Alpine Republic collapsed again.
Swiss banks’ safes have become a symbol for unshakeable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which leads directly to the Lake Curyš, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are wonderful, the leases of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's is located here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli confectionery plants.
For centuries there have been Swiss banks: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The reception hall of UBS enters with heavy turning doors.
Inside are walls facing marble, before them stand a massive leather chair, next to the bank's logo a large router to 'sejfu' -
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have sometimes, however, suppressed or betrayed the head of one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the newspaper, he finally closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks trades.
UBS has probably grown too much, it finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
The Swiss don’t have much to say about it anymore.
And if they were to adapt to the Anglo-Saxon manners long ago.
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed UBS, brought it first high profits and then disaster: No European Financial Institute lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
“On Wednesday, a government coalition of a small seven-million-dollar country took hold of the largest rescue event in the history of its nation,” writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book, Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save a large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you are talking to Swiss bankers, you see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a massive group.
A bank was established that was already too large for small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, the two different bank predecessors of UBS were added: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a centre of gravity in the management of assets and poorer, but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in favor of a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I’ve always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are the team of the future,” said bank expert Hans Geiger.
Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, a man who controls feelings around the stomach, who has developed entirely upwards from banking science.
But Ospel said he was relying on Wuffli at the end.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He probably thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
This is a tragic case -
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meeting of executives, at which Wuffli’s corporate chief repeated the same slogan: “Goldman Sachs is collapsing from the throne.”
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She said, “League Tables,” an agenda that documents the success of the bank of that time.
In it, UBS tried to put it all up.
A few steps she had already succeeded.
In the exchange and stock trade, she participated in the game completely above.
However, business advisors who have been entrusted with stress one weakness: In international interest trade, in the speech of bankers, “Fixed Income”, there is probably a great gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has some gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided on an adventure that almost cost it existence.
Hunger after growth, the bank itself and its venture fund, both invested in the U.S. Subprime investment.
It developed into a powerful machine that repacked securities into American mortgages and passed on - but also kept its own risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
“In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS was buying there,” bank expert Geiger said.
How great is euphoria, so deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean were more difficult than thought.
The position at UBS has become a catapulting seat and to this day with a swing.
Whoever runs a big bank now has almost an impossible job.
He must find a strategy for banks that all close business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has an idea: End with investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to go away, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new head of bank, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted: “He is to run UBS stores for a long time,” the bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its state in the mid-1990s.
3,500 places are cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But in public, he only says that he will find an apartment with his wife first in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart Gates are Expanding in Cities
In many places, field ravens are considered to be “problem birds”: However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be expelled from cities long ago, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The Crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some villages complaints of the inhabitants to dirt and noise caused by the animals accumulate.
However, there is no means of ‘problematic birds’ in sight.
Field ravens can no longer be expelled from cities, said experts at the first symposium on the vortex in East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible starting points.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Protectors of nature have also brought the problems of cities from the exodus of particularly protected field ravens: the use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing construction and cutting of typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Wreaths are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nest couples are, among others, in Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz, and Achima at Bremen and Leera.
There, the 2005 controversial project of mass killing of a vran in the rural district sparked negative headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of animals for birds and the killing of cages particularly brutal.
“Normal extermination, scaffolding, nothing brings - so much has been found by the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing nests by water spills or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
Animals retreat, large colonies split and split into other places.
Plastication is only thought-out as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We must live with them, we will not get them away.”
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The combination of throwing animals out of sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
Information board instead of chain saws - promoted, on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, because of a completely different treatment of animals: \"One cucumber in the face can eventually best stop with self-confidence\"
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the trail in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg, on which they provide information boards of lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project is already accepted by tourists.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: ‘This is every volume of communication, they have a lot to say.
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the Havrans of the field use not only the aid to reach the Paml, but they will even make their tool as a tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the behavior on four field ravens, as far as bird intelligence is concerned.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must lead to the destruction of the structure in order to get to the moth.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have in order to cause the collapse of the platform.
In the second attempt, the cunning Crows had to solve a more turbulent problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a pier larvae.
The birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in them.
Of them, she formed all four animals a hook, with the help of which she hunted from the tube a container for a holder.
Three out of four field ravens managed to do it even with a latch.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks did not come out for the cup.
Favourite Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won their final European Championships 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Leaded by the twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronald (8th, 53th), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth participation in the European Championship after the result of 0:0 in the first match.
The Czechs had a 1-0 (0:0) result when the first match was clear.
Croatia with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored further goals for Portugal.
A former Wolfsburg professional from the Federal League Zvjezdan Misimovic transformed by a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) doubled for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed to playoffs to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
Portugal made a tailor-made start at Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
About a good quarter hour later, Nani demonstrated his quality in the shooting at a long distance and adjusted the shot from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half hour, had their first clear chance at goalkeeper Edina Dzek.
The former Wolfsbur player from the English side of the Manchester City standing table settled with the head of the ball on the lower edge of the belly, but the ball did not exceed the goalline (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was at the centre.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and granted the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the counterparty Stark made a disputed criminal kick after the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the European Vice-Master of 2004 made it clear with four shots.
Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion leaves for the fifth in a row at the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilk with the legionary of Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to go beyond a terrible second in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Čech prevented reflexively at the last moment possible own goal of Tomáš Sivok (9).
Montenegro had its biggest options when duo Steve Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot at 40 minutes from the border of the criminal territory just around the Czech Gate.
After the break, the cross-browser had to save the place of the already crushed goalkeeper of the world class Czechs, again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50.).
Shortly before the conclusion, he finally made everything clear.
At that time, Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink is almost confident of his place on the third stage of the 2002 World Cup, Croats may enjoy their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience almost a fairy-tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance only a rod, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the reflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took control to an ever greater extent.
They also did not receive a goal after the break of Croat.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who released the Dortmund Ivan Perisice from 62 minutes, there were still legionaries from the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni is going to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the coach Giovanni Trapatton's team, who took care of 4:0 success in the first match for a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to lead.
Konstantin Vassilev (57.) leveled for guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had a good chance.
At the very last minute, Estonian defense has prevented the potential leader of the goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was quite far away.
After the failed defense of the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China.

Massacre at Personal Level
Peter Englind’s Emotionally Strong New Book Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War begins with such a long list of emerging characters as your head turns.
One advice on how to behave at the moment: Take this page carefully and make it a bookmark.
For you will be very familiar with all the people in Mr. England’s novel storytelling, and this list will serve as a navigation - like a beacon - in moments when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as \"anti-historic work\" -
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s not even a book about what happened, it explains the author, as it were, a book about what it was like, “It’s mainly about feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
“Beauty and sorrow” combines 20 more dozen men and women on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives pass like flames of candles inflamed in the church - new ones are added to the entanglement of fates, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englind's book differs from classical historical novels.
It regulates the idea that the First World War was only about the horrific extortions on the Western Front.
“Beauty and sadness,” he also skilfully explores other places where war drama took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that bees nests fall on them, have to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or they are struggling with the presence of fly tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning it is a very touching reading.
War consumes people's lives as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katie smelling gunpowder.
When the shooting of the cannons starts to ring in the distance, and you are the woman who is home with your children, will you run or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, even why the whole war has been waged.
“The vacuum resulting from the lack of facts,” Mr. Englund noted, “was filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fairy tales.”
“Beauty and sorrow” follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from CVs, letters, and other already published materials.
Descriptions of their lives can sound scary and engaging, but by integrating tiny moments and details, they are absolutely alive and credible.
Many of them are talking about losing and dealing with it.
In the story of the German student, the author says: “Replacements, everywhere substitutes”
Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper dressings, wooden buttons
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
The reference is made of ‘mass made of pressed rice cooked in excavated fat (and supplemented by a false bone of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles -
It notes that there were 837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes.
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds inner impulses for wildness and brutality, and says of war: ‘You will finally understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretending that your mask represents civilization, and that there is no barbar behind that scraped self inside.’
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die soon and no one will even notice it, let alone mourn.
“When a person finally reconciles himself with the sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen before the eyes of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “condemned man who secretly hangs”
Other comments are about the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
“The conflict has become more and more an economic competition and a competitive struggle,” Mr. Englund writes, “a war between factories.”
He captured what he calls a “new kind of beast of the coming century: a eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in clothes cut to the degree that he does his bloodshed without getting up from the table.”
People behave unexpectedly, submission alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some kind of sexual illness from prostitutes to avoid serving on the front.
“The most grotesque example of this behavior was the traffic of gonococcal pus, which the soldiers had bought and fought through the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“The most desperate of them have been in their eyes, which has often blinded them until the end of their lives.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. England's prose is lush, but it does not show any evidence, which is a great fit for his human theme.
In dozens of tiny outlets, she captures the way war - she has unleashed absolutely irrefutable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred -
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were mostly working with signs, such as “First World War and Modern Memories,” by Paul Fussell, or novels such as “The Western Front of Peace,” by Eric Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating endings, which in popular science literature does not resemble.
But I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author had jumped out of the book, pulled the page out of your list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute, an exact scheduled accident
She was attended by hundreds of policemen, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time the Zuccotti park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except for a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, could not be repeated, thereby violating the rules of separation, and in addition, the wave of sympathy of the public has spilled over to the side of the skateboards.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at cleaning Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by operations taking place in other cities.
Massive exercises for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was a preparation for the event in Zuccotti Park.
Leading officials have strengthened the so-called training for the suppression of riots - anti-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of policemen - with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally - at the last minute - said someone to whom the event was originally explained only as \"workout\"
“I know a few police officers who were also called into this event, and no one has ever told them that he is going to the Zuccotti Park,” said the person who spoke only on condition that he would remain anonymous.
“On going to Zuccotti Park, they only knew the highest position of the department members.
One reason for the secrecy was the lesson that the city had already received.
On October 14th, the city’s leaders had planned to clean the park, but then retreated from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they were recorded before the operation started in the park for hundreds.
Tuesday's events were attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of policemen who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people are coming to the park, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
“It was appropriate to do this at a time when there will be as few people in the park as possible,” he said.
Before the troops set off, they ranked at the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The light and the recorded message of the ampliones scared many demonstrators.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue windmills, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
Police say she didn’t touch a single tent until 1:45 in the morning, giving the demonstrators time to pack things.
Other police teams were seen gathering on the edge of the park to allow them to enter if there was a need for arrest.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, chief spokesman for the police department, said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition some police officers treated them rudely.
Mr Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street led along the western border of the park could have been filmed without any problems.
The police were moving westward and entangled with a dense confusion of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and a bag of igelite bags full of clothes, behind them, leaving the teams out of the hygienic department, which immediately stockpiled everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park, documenting image materials appeared a while later on the Internet.
The worst group of demonstrators resorted near the kitchen in their campground, which was located near the center of the park.
Some of them have created barriers and the police have begun their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the center of the camp were attached to each other.
And two people tied to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service members were called to cut the locks.
There was no arrest in the park until 3:30 in the morning, Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
The majority of the arrests took place because of the “organization of riots and resistance to arrests,” he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, was the highest-ranking uniform officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, commander of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but “he didn’t participate in the operation management,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, there was an abbey.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
Policemen were seen in one place, many of which were equipped with shields, as they pushed people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
At five o'clock in the morning, one demon was seen south of Pine Street, as he jumped on the hood of a police car, and several others who had released air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Trade union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for release
Departments representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that the release was not necessary and was also discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court overturn is probably the last option left to the District Council 37 unions in their attempt to reverse the release decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other staff who were among the city’s worst paid employees, described their release as the city’s remuneration for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by working figures last spring, by which the city wanted to plug a gap in the budget.
City officials have categorically rejected the allegations.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said that the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the board immediately countered by not specifically talking about the release of auxiliary workers in the budget.
District Council 37 officials have announced that they have already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they will be suing them. On Wednesday they will convene a press conference, where they will formally report a lawsuit at the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the defendants will be eight redundancies, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city’s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore would not comment on the individual charges.
According to a complaint filed by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of released in the poor parts of the city, thus trying to support their claims of unfair conduct, since they believe that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island did not leave at all, and at least in the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and 46 assistants were released in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
He recalls that five out of eight assistants have lost their jobs at the School of Public School 36 in Harlem, although it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: ‘It is not a neighborhood full of movable parents who can procure funds to offset the deficit in the budget’.
The budget of the Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the bonus funds were calculated for each registered poor student.
Departments, among other things, claim that the directors of secondary schools could have been confused in the manner in which the document approving the release of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word “excess” was used to describe the event, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school’s pay list to the database of available staff whose wages are paid by the central authority.
Sixty-six parent coordinators were released, standing in a complaint proposal, and not just moved to the database to the position of available staff.
The mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and the U.S. troops on their “relevance”
“With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who started rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts.
The above-mentioned sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya until now has been easy.
During the summer, lawmakers from both sides were constantly arguing with each other and with the White House about the text of a series of declarations to approve or, on the contrary, reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented resolutions authorising the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House due to the disparate views of both parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the funding of U.S. operations in Libya.
In Libya, the U.S. mission was literally in a legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama's mission was managed, but its members apparently did not irritate him enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
At the end of the day, the Congress’s importance was overtaken by other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The mission of Nato officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
The International Relations Commission, in its statement, congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity they have spent trying to free their people, and praises the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies who have engaged in operations to protect the Libyan population for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The statement also confirms the United States’ national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.
Will the new proposal be fully supported by the International Relations Commission, or will the legislators be again divided into two-half, as was the case with the June proposal?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the chief representative of the Republican Party, stood up against the latest version.
Lugar’s spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject matter to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
For the time being, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution, which were presented in the congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted by the House and the Senate - and others are only minor alterations of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget supplement and another handful that would like - regulate federal spending -
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents - especially the novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their 'authorship' -
The statement on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the supplement on the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement to support the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the number of periods in which members of the congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in office as president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of additions that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage and an amendment prohibiting the burning of the state flag.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various additions, they do not, in comparison with previous flights, significantly stave off the average.
In the 111th Congress, 77 additionals were offered, while 66 were in the 100th Congress.
Their activity even palely compared to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate statistics, members offered more than 150 extras every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last addition, which was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was designed by Congress in 1789.
“Clothed, but not defeated,” Gifford said in her first TV interview with the shooting.
Ten months after she was injured immediately by a shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on national television on Monday night, she sang along with a song from the Broadway show, The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow, and said that more than returning to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared in the 20/20 show at ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of sentences still makes her problems and in walking needed help.
The whole show documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary for the injury caused by a bullet that pierced her skull, penetrated the left half of her brain and left her head out.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to take a triumphant part in the vote on the debt ceiling.
During her first TV interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as 'difficult'.
When Savyer asked her how she felt, the 40-year-old Giffords replied, “All right.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on the show, 20/20, which was aired on the eve of the new book of this couple, titled “Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope”
The special watched Gifford's full recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In the videos that Kelly made during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar over the entire forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more than just lift one or two fingers at a time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and taught by therapists how to perform simple activities.
Squeeze your head.
Rinsing of lips.
And then, her first word: “What?”
In a few days, Giffords said another word - 'toast - when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
The video broadcast by ABC shows that Giffords’s recovery role has been played by music: Congressmans sing on them together with a melodies therapist to songs, “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” by Cyndi Lauper and “Free Fallin,” by Tom Petra.
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours of therapy a day, the Savyers said she didn’t remember anything from the day the shooting took place.
Her husband said Gifford had read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who was the six who had been killed in the incident.
The shooting is a suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a Missoury prison, where he waits for a trial under the influence of violent drugs.
“A lot of people died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
“The terrible, the terrible, the terrible.”
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife said during the recovery: “I have lost”
“So I immediately said to her: Gabby, you didn’t lose,” Kelly said.
“You just got a load.
But you can do it, you can get together, and you'll come back stronger than ever before.
Military units are more compassionate than respectful.
The event was a gala evening on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aeronauticals and Marines gathered around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose up and entrenched.
“Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the Spring Beneficiaries.
In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military forces somewhat differently, attended the ceremony evening.
“They were all introduced as orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
Military service is included with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they regret the individual in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brig-Gen Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
“The only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls.”
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who don’t want to look thankless or ruin relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face when returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are spoken silently and privately between war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from fighting events, where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles outside the Army.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and wonder, because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will drill their heads if, under the surface, a bad, violent veteran is hiding,” said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and after his return took a place in Washington’s government.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, some people who were interviewing him unobtrusively indicated whether so soon after returning from the fight he could resist the stress associated with work in Washington.
“When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions,” Cancian taught his sons.
The military’s concern partly stems from American indifference to wars.
The successes on the battlefield rarely gather recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and has little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as we used to be in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by both politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure to severely intervene against rape
This week, it will decide whether to launch a trial of 28 women and men against the army due to alleged inaction in case of rape.
If not, they are ready to file a lawsuit against hundreds of other applicants.
Elizabeth Lyman's first-class soldier was reportedly raped by her military colleague, 25 years old, and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008, and she headed to the cassars at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she met her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her to drink a little in her room.
“There was a warning light in my head,” Lyman said.
But the native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
I thought, \"No, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I wish I could listen to my instincts.”
She claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, the man moved to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former military members will wait for a hearing verdict that could have a historical impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will get to court.
The allegation states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The allegation was filed in February by Washington’s lawyer Susan Burke and the defendant party had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their number has grown to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army, and that the military failed to investigate, punish, and any pursuit of justice following the announcement of these hostages.
Burke says he's walking around the neck of the top military commanders because the problem is starting with them.
“The armament is a directive system,” he says.
Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to implement measures against such acts?
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: rather than grouping up all the allegations into this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in more different cases, if necessary, so as not to relieve pressure.
The Defense Ministry’s defense team is led by U.S. state prosecutor Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, has given rise to a rejection of the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek are in detail disassembly of the defense strategy - in principle, the point is that current or former troops can't sue for the injuries they have suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
“The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the defendants,” the document states.
The Ministry of Defense refused to comment on this matter.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in battle, it is only vocabulary: in modern wars it is difficult to find clearly given front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldiers’ teams played an increasingly important role, particularly in the field of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between these wars - two-thirds of them in combat.
The time has come to be upgraded in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, but three other lawyers are involved in the case.
At Yale School of Law, visitors to the Veteran Seminar on Legal Services are preparing a lawsuit for four major military academys for the supposed development of an atmosphere that promotes hate for women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of U.S. Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for its action against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of a personality disorder, which was allegedly found at the victims of the rape, so that the army has a pretext for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, belonging to the group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, it is a completely common practice.
In December, the group filed a lawsuit against the state organisation for dealing with the veteran, which it accused of discriminatory practices that would occur in processing aid applications by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were put forward by a group of senators and deputies from both parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to Pentagon estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in the year.
A report issued in March also discusses the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military were brought to court - half of them compared to the civil justice system.
The defendants in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a number of traumas.
For example, a first-class soldier, Lyman, reported an alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it was expected to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and in her bed was found the blood of the attacker - from the wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman received a hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she had sex with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six people were called to testify as witnesses of the reputation in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately released from guilt.
“I remember the day the judgment was delivered,” Lyman said.
“I felt like I was going to give birth right there, with a scream I ran out of the court.”
“They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my chief officer, ‘It wasn’t his judgment.’
Lymans ordered him to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed with a personality disorder, calling her ineligible to service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without a claim to service.
Whether Lyman's case and other prosecutors are moving to the next stage or not, it's running on a long track, says John Turley, Law Professor at George Washington University.
Of course, she notes, “From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the next stages of the discussion.”
But there is a doctrine between them and the verdict, which has been criticized since the first moment that the light of the world was seen.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army is several decades behind, because their responsibilities do not show the same degree of motivational stimuli and deterrence.
He adds: “The chances are hard against them... but it’s important for them to try it out.”
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in favour of them, Burkevoa, the lawyer of the defendants, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to file a lawsuit and will start working on other cases relating to the subject.
“We will not stop fighting with the military on this issue, where there will be no reform,” he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes before.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Investigating You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who admitted to July’s murderous bias, which left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, in cyberspace he was definitely not lonely: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time at the computer, he chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing group on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easily - just go to Facebook.
“We realized that finding them isn’t really that hard,” said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent British research team report on European digital populism.
“The supply of personal information on Facebook is so extensive,” Bartlett says, “that scientists are enough to simply use advertising on the site and, with complete accuracy, to determine a sought-after demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups who focused on them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of calling them into a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they were invited to fill out a questionnaire that raised questions about the level of their education, their relationship to violence and optimism due to their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not as surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, who promote a growing degree of immigration.
But on the other hand, ‘those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more rational, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the screen of the computer’.
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything from health problems to social trends that hide status updates, wall posts, and pressed buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them on average will provide three different data on a daily basis, making this social network a literally “information supernova”, which is behind the development of many new researches. The number of academic works, in whose name the word Facebook occurs, increased from the state five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, Facebook’s magic is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
\"It was previously true that when you wanted to conduct a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.
“You’d have to get to the side where they’d never let you go,” Bartlett says.
“All this Facebook is breaking down, you’re just going straight to them.”
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid the social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their opiate outputs on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept silent about the subject.
Moren proposes that students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunk statuses.
“The problem can’t be solved if you can’t diagnose it,” said Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Child Development at Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise not have a chance to discover.”
Facebook constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team of the site has compiled statistics on the relationship statuses and on Valentine’s Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the national satisfaction coefficient (in particular, using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the website should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is tracking whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, it is necessary to provide your personal information to the page.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most users even thought scientists could view their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
“When it was about them, they took it so that there was information between them and their friends,”
It is also important to consider the methodology.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and posts on the wall is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook continue to remain the best possible tool for research.
“When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
\"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a lot of social activities are still happening off-line\"
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the fall of two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter during his first public hearing in Oslo.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among Norwegian Templar Knights,” the court said.
“I object to the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by organisations supporting the ideology of hate and because it promotes multiculturalism.”
“I confess myself to my actions, but I admit no guilt for them.”
Judge Torcjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because he “did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views.”
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a ready speech with him, allow relatives of his victims to reach out at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibiting any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and announced that authorities would have complete control over all of his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives and survivors participated in the hearing.
Some have come in the hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure that he is held firmly under the lock.
They all took part in order to move the case to early closure.
“It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman,” one of the survivors of the attack told NRK.
“It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard a suspect, I mentally moved back a little further.”
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional at all times. At the arrival and departure of the building, it was easy to look the journalists and the survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre idea that he was part of a larger movement of “resistance”, the judge admitted that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any co-rapist.
For someone, it may be a comfort that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
“I wish it would fall out like a creature, but it’s not so,” said a relative of one of the victims.
If so, everything would be much easier.
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie going to cinema this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of the people who compared him with Henry Ford began to appear, and they chose him as his genius, the greatest modern inventor.
In a recently rediscovered Job’s interview, which was sprayed for a special film that goes to cinema this week, Apple’s fans will be the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who fits every detail into the smallest details - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer - the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent resulting product is still a long way of working a lot -
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour-long interview took place.
At the time, it was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands on working with his new computer company, NeXT, and he eagerly looked at how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used on TV, and the original copies of the interview were traditionalized to have been lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, copies of VHS were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly cropped, that forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs film: The Lost Interview, which goes to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has been famous for his/her distaste for providing longer interviews, Jobs is surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his/her technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is seen how the Jobs answers perfectly think to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism comes to the surface, when Cringely’s issues are unsatisfied and driven to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and there are horrific prophetic ideas in it when Jobs assess what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the posthumous evaluation of Job's career, but on Jobs, whom we see here as a eager dreamer in the flowering of his genius, there is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of what things might and should look like.
It did not take long, and after speaking his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to drive a business:
“Throughout the years of business, I’ve always asked myself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same: ‘Well, that’s just how it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business-related things.
I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the inscription - the standard cost - about their amount could only be assumed. At that time, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the trading costs within a moment.
As he did on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the 'Blue Box' he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and call for free anywhere in the world.
In the past, many have been written about the device, but Job's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested devices using a paid phone and during the call they were allowed to connect from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a dozen times we got around the world like this, so when we shouted at something in a paid phone, it was heard a minute later from the other phone at the door,” he laughs.
“We were young and we found ourselves able to build a thing that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars worldwide.”
The two of us made a little thing that managed to control a much bigger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I think Apple would never have been created without it.
Jobs continues by describing the joke they almost reached the end with Wozniak. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, and they were best married to Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, the Catholic Church members were called to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the Pope himself was raised to the phone, the couple became angry and the headset lay down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett on his phone list and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a summer Brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it formed my view of what such a company was and how it was supposed to treat its employees.
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw the first desktop computer ever made.
He was big like a trunk, he had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I was advancing higher and higher in HP, floating around that computer and starting to write programs for him.
How he invents innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products while running.
In the early days of his career, when he went on to sell a few boards with printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to put a whole computer together for him.
He had only 30 paid days available, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he remembers the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember how wildly we were arguing... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to set up a mouse that would cost $300] when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies breathe:
A long time before Apple’s resurrection, Jobs predicted that many industrial leaders were clashing in their vision and losing their market share.
“Let’s say you work with IBM or Xerox, so you make better copies or printers, and what’s next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At this point, sales and marketing are already in place, so companies are headed by people who are in charge of just this, while people who are in charge of their own products are extorted from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that the company has led to its unshakeable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are essential.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it was, it could have been Microsoft’s 1990s.
But instead of winning, they earned a loss.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
“There is still a long way and a lot of work between an excellent idea and an excellent result product... and how the great idea develops, so does it change and grow.”
During that time, you will learn a lot about it.
You have to come to a whole range of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do not make.
You have to keep in mind 5 000 things all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked there were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, by the way, also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s Health Care Act, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a solemn dinner sponsored by a law firm that will take part in the hearing before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases under investigation was a lawsuit brought by 26 states calling into question the radical rework of healthcare, which last year was approved by Congress - a law that mobilised conservative activists around the world.
Judges have agreed to hear the action, but in March there is a 5,5-hour meeting, which will further boost the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
A lawyer who stands before the court and tries to reach a law rejection will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been engaged in the defense of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenge the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Entrepreneurship.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which there are huge funds at stake in the process.
The dinner was held at the Washington hotel a few hours after the trial on the subject of the case.
He attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Supreme Representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And give guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: This pair of judges have been taking part in the Federalist Society’s actions for years.
And it’s definitely nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are freed from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if that were not the case, their behavior would definitely fall under the principle of C4, which says that “the judge can participate in events that are just related and other organizations organizing for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor must he be included in the programme of action.”
However, the relation between Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms operating in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was well enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to code of conduct is contrary to the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“Judges drank and ate on social benefits together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case before the court,” he said.
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the feet with all claims of unbiasedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas only showed their criticisms a little understanding and told them that they would also seamlessly combine their judicial obligations with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a highly conservative activist.
In addition, the conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor under President Obama’s rule when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Kagana’s critics are pushing her to give up taking part in the case, claiming that she was fighting so much for the law that she could now be unbiased.
Kagan had no indication that she was about to resign.
Boeing Receives Record Contract for 18 Billion USD Current Plane
Emirates are ordering 50 Boeing 777 two-cylinder jets with the option of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually not a reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is Boeing Co., and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it is something else.
The same is true of where Boeing has obtained the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
Chicago estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history on the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 double-jet Boeing 777.
The sensational order came from Emirates Airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing said the airlines had the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which would give the total value of the contract to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company,” said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
The quality of these specific customers is very high.
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to oil-producing nations there.
This means that they not only have the money to pay aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so crucial because the country itself makes money at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or delay aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora says.
“They have natural protection,” he says.
The Emirates contract strengthens Boeing’s leadership position on the wide-body aircraft market and brings to the narrow Airbus SAS, which wanted to attempt to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’s representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, will take place.
As a result, customers demanded greater payloads and landings, the manufacturer took the time to supply the machine with more engine power.
Boeing Co's share price increased 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
Mexican President's sister was defeated in the Michigan elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent Faust Vallejon of PRI was helped in the pursuit of the governor’s chair by drug traffickers.
Sister Felipe Calderona appears to have lost in the violent state elections for the post of governor in Michoacán. On Monday, she later declared that one of her opponents had helped the drug traffickers to win.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership of the Governorial elections of the Western state Faust Vallejo by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of the members of the organised crime into the entire electoral process, and especially until yesterday’s election itself, is alarming not only for Mikhoacán, but for the whole country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview with the radio day after Sunday’s election.
“They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion poll group... They seized urns, built roadsides... and let people vote to order for PRI.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000 when it lost its presidency.
However, he plans to return soon to power, and victory in the MICHOACAN elections is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very close.
Calderon, the candidate for the conservative side of her brother, National Action Party, or the PAS, refused to recognize Valleyon as the winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, who until now ruled the governorial office. For the disputed and unhappily persecuted party, before the 2012 presidential election, it is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacan has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and metamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán that in December 2006 he started a military struggle against the traffickers.
However, violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAS, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election, and many candidates resigned from the election.
However, whatever the results of the election in Michoacán look for the PRI party, winning the party will help to gain a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington Vallejo, congratulated him and said: “I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year.”
ADB calls on Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the euro area from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be a overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB, based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must do everything they can to help recover the currency block quickly through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European difficulties, “too unexcitedly,” and declared that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and resources would help to spark the long-term collapse of the global economy.
\"We are all in this together -
“So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is fit,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it’s definitely not immune.”
“So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it.”
The European Monetary Association has been undergoing a major debt crisis for several months.
Italy’s lending costs have increased dangerously in recent days and both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could withdraw again into a recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring emerging frontal economies together to help the euro area find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but he noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds of the Fund for financial assistance of the European Union, the institution for European financial stability - would provide Asian partners of European countries with greater negotiating opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said: “India will do its best to help the Eurozone because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying inflow of foreign capital.
“No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We face a difficult task and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that emerging economies, such as the Indian ones, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
“One might find that the Greeks are retired at 50 and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would be difficult to explain,” he said.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian stocks should be used to keep many Greek citizens well-paid in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is at risk of a “hazardous domino effect”
The bank’s prediction that there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 is now facing a risk of decline due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must create “unforeseeable spending plans” to protect them from the decline and significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in the area of defense
On Monday, Defense Minister Leon Panetta put it right under the boiler when he warned that drawing automatic cuts in the budget could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next decade, but is now concerned about a further $600 billion cut if Congress fails to conclude an spending deal.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress’s inability to reach an agreement on the budget, resulting in so-called attachment, would result in a 23% flat-rate decline and the cessation of many new projects.
“Because of such a huge reduction, used in this unwise way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipping projects - you can not buy only three quarters of the building or boat. In addition, there could be serious damage to other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We will also be forced to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is going so fast, we will also have to send civilians almost certainly for forced leave so that we are able to meet the target requirements,” he said.
“These changes can shake up with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously harm its readiness.”
In the end, the cuts will also affect the combat units, Panetta said.
“Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets,” Panetta said.
“There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in delays in agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people.”
“The status of paid employees will be reduced, which will result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent disruptions to legal and political support”
Both senators sent Panett back ten days ago and asked him for details on possible impacts on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequences of the strike at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power.”
“We are strictly against this tough measure,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panett’s letter.
“It’s not a conclusion that we can live with, and we definitely don’t want to sign under it.”
“Planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow.”
“It will only be seen if Panett’s letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress’s budget and strengthen the voices calling for the Pentagon to be omitted from the list of cut-off areas.
Panetta was more and more open in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself moved to his high position in the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute week, the Minister of Defense indicated a brief picture of what his ministry could expect - the shell of the army, but inside which the core will be missing.
It will be like a ship without sailors.
It will be like a regiment without ammunition.
“It will be like aviation without trained pilots.”
“It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of cassars, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission,” Panetta said at the beginning of a speech in the Pentagon.
He will be as a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy.
As a result, it will welcome aggression.
In the Annex, delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, he specifies how the reduction will result in a \"significant operational risk: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant restriction on the possibility of decommissioning and deployment worldwide; the anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations -
Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could wait to end, including those already tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the military and the Marines wanted to replace the humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the F35, $80 billion would be saved over the next decade, but its supporters say it is a necessary next step in improving the military that needs the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A clear look at recent headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands on the charge of sexually harassment several women - both sides say the other is lying.
The administrators at Penn State University were charged with a false testimony when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught saying that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar to U.S. President Barrack Obama.
The lie was able to destroy the entire career, and to break the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately refuted by undisputed evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of misusing funding from his campaign to try to conceal his unmarried relationship.
And no one ever forgets the media circus that sank around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in office about his sexual attachment with Monica Lewinska.
It's all about lying stories about cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers only to look good themselves in their assessments.
Men who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
How many scams do we face?
Studies show that in a single day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers failed three times in the first ten minutes of their first encounter.
Determining lies, or “recognizing lies,” is an essential skill that everyone should acquire for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let’s say, Sharada, when a person cries out: ‘I have you, the recognition of a lie is a serious industry of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look in your eyes.
It's not like they're stuck, stunned, reddished, or stunned.
Don’t assume that it’s hard to detect and detect lies.
A trained false identifier can reveal truth from a windy structure, small expressions in the face, a way of creating questions and their timing.
I’ve spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a large and evolving lie-recognition industry, and it’s clear that uncovering a lie is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can help you a lot in today’s complex world, especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars are able to read well in others, let them pour in vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men carry more “self-centered” lies, while women say more lies “focused on others” - mostly to protect someone’s feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than to the single people (all the lies they say are mostly “indiscriminate”.
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “initial observation.”
Thanks to him, he will have later findings with what to compare.
Notice the possession of the body of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone routinely knocks their feet constantly so that you don’t unjustly accuse him of lying just because he starts to knock his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, only take it as warning signs, not as evidence of a lie.
People carrying a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their invented story, they can tip their shoes to the door, rush to the exit, significantly change the posture of the body, or show 'relief at the end of the conversation' - exaggerated relaxing breathing and changing the position when the confession behind them is difficult.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what relief will look like after its end.
Also see the language of the subject.
The famous story is how Scott Peterson once spoke and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which triggered a nationwide search for her body.
Deceptive individuals can also express themselves in a measured manner: ‘I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky - or they will repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very small.
Someone can use a lot of ‘relieving language’ when they answer a difficult question: ‘Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best consciousness’
In such a response, we will not learn too much facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to master the skills by which lies can be cleared.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a better chance not to fly a liar and a fraudster in his personal and work.
The controversial oil pipeline construction plan will be redirected after the threat of delaying approval by the US government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus inciting trade unions against each other, but calming environmentalists - a company with pipeline construction to the mayor announced that she was willing to redirect the project to move things again.
TransCanada announced Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
According to TransCanada, Alex Pourbax’s claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
This announcement came after the Foreign Ministry declared last week that it was delaying the decision on the federal permit of the project, from where it would not conduct a study of possible alternative routes, through which it would be possible not to hit the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the water layer of Ogallala, a large underground water supply plant.
“This is really a move forward,” said Republican Deputy Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have taken any decision until 2013, a year after the next election, but the authorities refuse to play a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile-long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Alberta Province to Texas Refinery, 700,000 barrels of oil flow daily.
Six states will have to cross this path.
This project is completely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by working figures that estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to hit the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala water layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but the energy industry source said that the Ministry's inspector general ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, and focused mainly on two questions.
Once it was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the program.
Another, if the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of turning back fear for her toddler
New York’s family claims that Patti LaBelle, a singer, has ferociously invaded the vestibule of their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter so that she turned back from that fear.
“Lady Marmalade’s performance scares 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she has suffered “personal changes, sleep disorder” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family said in a lawsuit brought to Manhattan’s Supreme Court.
On November 10, last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a school teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk built a car, Roseanna Monkey went down into the vestibule of their house in Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with him.
Roseanna Monica said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
“Someone appeared behind my back and said, ‘You know what your daughter is doing, ‘I said ‘yes,’ and I left to pick her up.’
LaBelle was an irritant pregnant woman.
“Aggressively, she said to me, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter at the door,’ Roseanna Monica said.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care about your opinion.’
She was angry and started to talk stupidly - she cried out the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water with her and started to wait for me.
He claims that Genevieve has received a hysterical attack.
“I said to the woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’ said the mother of the child.
LaBelle, who still had Genevieve in her arms, threw her away and had to stop her until her escort, who then pulled her out into the waiting car, said Roseanna Monica.
In the meantime, her daughter screamed so much when she came back, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle, but they received no answers.
The lawyer and spokesperson of the singer LaBelle do not respond to our calls to comment on the whole case.
The lawsuit calls for an indeterminately indemnified, but family attorney, Sam Davis, said the case took place free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money it has to a cancer charity.
“The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in his arms.
Climate change slows down the economy
During the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdez increased unemployment and unreliability in Sinaloa, with foreign investment falling and the economy with them.
The year 2011 will be written into the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdez, which is itself called the government of change. This government brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year there was no growth and even a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the possibilities of state economic growth, and reduced economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year, as the agricultural sector experienced a historical decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to a report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78,03% were completely destroyed and partial damage was detected on the remaining 21,07%.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the state experienced increased growth during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 people of the state of Sinaloa were not employed, which represents the unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28%, and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise and reached 6.19%, which represents approximately 74,000 unemployed. Therefore, compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed increased by 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
For unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa, there may be more factors. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences UAS, an increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at the level of public policy.
“We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market due to the reduction of resources due to legislation approved by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally seize dollars, it is not easy for them to earn, invest them or use them for something,” he said.
Stop Migration
López Cervantes said there was also a demographic factor involved in the rise in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave for work abroad, to the United States has decreased, both because of difficult entry and then because even if these people go abroad, it is hard for them to get a job. So people remain and demand work from our state, so unemployment is growing,” he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed people in the state work without making social security benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative area, the lowest salaries from all over the country, as stated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 peset, deep below the national average, which is 7,375 peset.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most significant decrease in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period January to June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697, which represents a decrease of 87.74% compared to the amount of $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government lists investments of 17,280 million peseses per year. These investments were directed primarily to companies in the field of services.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. By November, no gains from debt were recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdés, pointed out the lack of government management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
“The development of the economy in Sinaloa was very small during this year. We need to work hard to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012 we need to double our efforts, we lack the harmonisation of efforts of all of us, and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let’s hope next year it will be much better,” he said.
Slow economy
Loredo López said events such as frost stopped the state economy at the beginning of the year and limited its development and growth.
“The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowing down of the economy, which was not quickly remembered enough, so that it could re-establish a dynamicity that would allow it to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That’s why at the end of the year we found ourselves deep under the expected forecasts,” he said.
Redefinition of mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employer Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
“In general, we observe that work is being done. We think we need to prepare a long-term plan in which the objectives and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better manage the government’s efforts.
“In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the field of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan,” he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is a lot of work ahead of us,” he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
He was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a health threat, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, walking in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in the El Castillo district, Navalo.
The dealer drove in a pick-up white delivery. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and a small backpack in the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Department and the proceedings remained internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impacts of Crimes.
Contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be drawn to the end or that they will have great delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of urban social development said that as long as construction works have gone forward, the government is now in danger of not being able to provide adequate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million peso per three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. By this time, only the Federation and the city were added, so it is possible that projects will be delayed.
“They’re supposed to provide almost 12 million, and although the year has come to an end, we didn’t get anything at all. Even though we should have got a part in July,” he said. “In order not to waste time, we started projects and continued very discreetly, but we lack money.”
He stated that last year for the administration of Jesús Aguilara Padilla the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million, which the government did not give them.
“We’ve already seen the case in the previous six-year period, because the state didn’t have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned earlier this year, we had to get resources to cover what the state didn’t finish,” he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise from state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that an application was sent to Armand Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance to speed up the management and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
“They were supposed to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven’t even received a peso yet.”
Court of Justice approves the end of analogous broadcasting in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to speed up the so-called \"disable\" of analog signals, and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree setting out the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected because a qualified majority of the eight votes needed for the court to be able to comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of that decree, which thus remains valid.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which is legally reserved to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Bordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The Ministerial Assembly also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a debate on the proposal, which is also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify himself with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure through general standards measures to prepare public administration.
“I don’t think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority,” he recalled, adding that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal executive who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is associated with better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitalization, which requires a decision on a matter of public interest, because digitalization does not only have a technical dimension, but it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues.
As he pointed out, these issues - require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state -
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and done so through their governments, even though they have had highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to introduce in the area of the administration compliance with the laws prepared by the legislative powers to some extent.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of summarizing - voice by voice -
According to data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second positions in the governor's elections is less than 27%. So far, 879 out of 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
This year's elections in Michoacán, where, in line with the data published by the Preliminary Elections Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second positions in the Governor's election was not yet counted by 879 votes in total of 6074 constituencies.
In this context, the Chairman of the General Council of the electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that several days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As mentioned above, Michoacán officially did not confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the electoral Justice Act. For the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel abandoned their publication within the time limit set in the Act of the Official State Journal, stating that he had any objections to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative authority and declared the voice of the head of state in the case of constitutional reforms invalid and illegal - because he has no right to approve or veto them -
On the question of the possibility of summarising the vote, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that it would be possible, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, to carry out a partial and total census by the local electoral authority.
In this way, a partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, can be carried out under the following conditions: the electoral results do not agree; there is no record of the number of votes and calculation in the relevant box or is not available to the chairman; or if there are errors and obvious violations of the electoral results.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all polls will be possible if there is an indication indicating that the difference between the potential winner of the elections and the candidate in second place is smaller or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session the express request of the party representative and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible if, after a proper summation, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate ended in second place. In such a case, the electoral packages for which a partial census has been made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is a election in Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. On Monday, a ceremony and a mass will take place.
According to the family, the Colonel’s last wish was that his ashes should be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving the highest honors with the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, Colonel's ash arrived at the chapel in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell took place at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school class class classmates and members of the American football team, whom Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of preparation for his studies.
“He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes should be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range. That’s what he always said to his family and friends,” said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot’s sister.
According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of his life, ‘he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family’.
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the air school Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went to his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio, remembers him as a very good man, ‘he barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo’.
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zafort to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked most about his life: the control of the plane.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him by the governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both study and sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter that he was driving fell. On board was also the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and the other six persons, all officials of that state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillen native Bacio Cortés arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the guidance of Major Jaime Martinez to the grounds where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL.
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in this area for crimes associated with organised crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into different parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned vessel of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was found on a 1.5 km road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at an area level known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the beige-cavage cottage had opened doors from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three meters away, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately warned the competent authorities.
One person wore a sports t-shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not shoes. Next to him, a person also lay in a sports t-shirt with white stripes.
A few metres further, the body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face to face.
According to the data collected at the sites, all three people were probably murdered in another place because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the cottages were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a number of traces of bullets, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretary presented 11 people, including youth, who were members of the criminal group, which operated mainly in the Cadereyta area, and which is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the published information, at the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one person was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called \"Los Zetas\"
The next effort took place on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on a traffic tour in Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta when they noticed cars without SPZ and in it two people.
After stopping the car, they carried out a tour and discovered one rifle, a rifle and 18 bullets.
Then, on November 13, at around 14 a.m., one of the complications in the La Frauda area was arrested. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal funerals in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country beyond the abyss of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the abyss of economic disaster, which has put the whole euro area in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report stating that Monti, named on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in an effort to create a government.
“I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” a former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
“The framework is now well marked,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis that has made the debt rise to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough package of austerity measures required by European leaders, which will only allow Italy to restore its breached credibility.
On Monti there is a lot of pressure to hurry up. Due to market instability, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of 7%, the level when Greece and Ireland had to ask for a rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Employer Organization Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government very much.”
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to come out of this burning situation.
Monti’s hope for success has increased significantly thanks to the PDL support of Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis forced her to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are predestined for good results,” said Angelina Alfano, the secret of the centre-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant, because until now, a number of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority, compiled by Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added to pressure and warns that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women organisations on Monday.
The meeting will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who allowed for a very quick procedure in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline from the end of last week, when Berlusconi was already clear that he was going to resign, the interest of Italian bonds returned to a critical border, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be able to reap success.
To save Italy, which has a public debt of €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti said his government should hold power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecasts that politicians would only give him time to make reforms, and then declare early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate policies into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must only be composed of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has reached due to financial pressure.
Political sources have stated that mutual distrust and disapproval between the parties make it difficult to incorporate political personalities into the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Rica
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one in 22 called players reached the number 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players of both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of A-class inter-choice matches on their accounts, Costa Rica has only a defender Michael Uman, who has played 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Run of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, have maintained intense activity in league championships and home championships and high-level matches within European Cups like the Champions League.
To the previous one, we also need to add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated match-offs to the European and world championships.
Costa Rica's players have very limited options for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish team has on his account the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (lost 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also join Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of matches on their account. Among them Zubizarreta with 126 and central attacker Schalke, Raul González, with 102.
Carles Puyol was also close to the 100 with 97 matches.
Following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Uman, the left wing of Junior Díaz moves with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Luis with 45.
In addition, only 5 crossed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica, the Bolivar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are waiting for their first match.
The best shot in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side, he has the most interventions Bryan Luis, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his tour on the occasion of celebrating 20 years of existence
The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band was ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We’ve been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that their ability to play Costa Rica represents a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and on Sunday 20th will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will perform from 19:30 at the National Stadium along with the Angelic group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of the interview, the whole transcript of which can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican supporters, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we were barely the second time, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the group here, the fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most rocky supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does this put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've performed in the past 21 years have been set up in a few weeks.
We have performed several great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we will get into the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love to serve, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing to Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to show you the best show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we’ll play every night.
When we have two songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we’ll remember why we liked them so much and maybe we’ve already forgotten it.
So, the show is more interesting for us, so I think it’s more interesting for people too.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
At first, I think none of us could imagine being in one big rock band and staying in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given, and we are concerned that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and love to make music.
We are lucky to have a look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the origin of grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group in which the great themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising that when a movement arises from a group of friends, it does not happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to come from one city at a time.
We are proud of this and we are honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play with some.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky to be all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and have the same members even after those years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this we have managed to open musical paths that leave everyone with enough freedom to experiment themselves.
We trust each other, we respect each other’s music, and I think it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word glory has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was getting easier and easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, you will remember that you need music and what you have given it, respect it. You must not let yourself be carried away by being famous, rock stars. This neither of us has really been interested in.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and at first it was something spectacular.
We existed as a band for three years and never released an album after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at photos, I remember Andy, how incredible it was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or about football and much more.
He was an incredible person and we are missing too much.
National band Las Robertas will be assigned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as pre-scheduled?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. That is why we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and have to be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter?
That's the question about Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing to him.
Who influences you as a bassist?
A lot of people.
I was first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I can talk about bassists that I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge even though it’s no longer fashionable?
I think we've always felt a slight separation from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I'm going to introduce the bands I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came into being at the same time. And if music is still valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney play better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music was slightly cloudy and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel like there are a couple of songs in the new album that are lighter to make, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very gloomy, although they may sound positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they are deep dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and have a trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make a gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was re-hospitalized for medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for the muscle loss he suffers in the lower limbs area.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has been operated four times and is now under control.
Member Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N TV that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said Fujimori might receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want grace because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times due to language cancer, dropped 18 kilograms, and other maladies such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs were added to these problems.
Fujimori has been serving the sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who had killed the murderous military squad operating illegally in the early years of his government.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political topics of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felip Calderón on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayian community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayian presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will be used to exchange information on political issues between the two countries,” Uruguay’s presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community. This statement sparked a rejected opinion by Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico presides over the G20 since November. The G20 is a group formed by the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, the Latin American country has concluded an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to specify fiscal exchange agreements with a view to getting out of the \"blacklist\" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded installer runs in 3D with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the couples of the Bowser evil, but has never appeared in 3D: in “Super Mario 3D Land” she will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month to all stores around the world has been created from the very beginning to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy is supposed to work without glasses,” said Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that \"Super Mario 3D Land\" is the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier - because until this point successful images such as \"Star Fox 64 3D\" or \"Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D\" were adaptations of already existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to being 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is a video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth party.
Álvarez confirmed that “Super Mario 3D Land” contains two games in one: the first part is “easy”, the task of which is to attract less skilled users.
Once you’ve surpassed this level, you can go into the “second round” at the levels of the game, which this time are more challenging.
In addition, users can choose a real time between the “aggressive D” or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and “not be subject to optical lies”
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays a note to those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous parts. It consists in the fact that the man’s bearded installer will have to go through dangerous-minored platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, around, in disguises and also among enemies, he also appears “playable” Luigi.
Colom approves the release of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he had taken action on the issue of the extradition of former President Alfons Portilla, who in the United States is to respond to a conspiracy to wash $70 million.
This is the end of a process aimed at Guatemala responding to a request from a northern country that calls for Portilla to be released so that it can be judged.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he kept in mind that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he did not interfere with court decisions and allowed all issues he had received on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for the murder and serious harm to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a step of enforcement after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead a trial against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of an infidelity of 120 million at the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed to return the case to the game.
Triniev has helped 6,000 young people in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the organization's social support is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organization has helped them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To do this, it is necessary to add a long hundred jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Last year’s anniversary was also used to present the balance sheet of the solemn act, which took place in the former factory premises of the Fabra i Coats factory and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was established in the Trinity Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, no work, drug addiction, or where they could fall into social exclusion.
Last year’s meeting in Sant Andre was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association in the last 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the election, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Triniev.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former mayor and current environmental-socialist councillor Ricard Goma took part in the ceremony.
The great hall of Fabra and Coats was also attended by the current social well-being and family advisor Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general manager of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijo’s work was created in a very difficult time, and that today’s time also offers many obstacles, but he added that the work that the association has brought to this day is a good foundation.
The president gave Triniyov an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,” he said.
There was an emigration of a forbidden house in which giant parties were held.
The aliens took 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All of this suggests that the nightmare experienced by neighbors in the 51st Street at Balmes is finally over.
Twelve people volunteered to leave the building which they illegally inhabited last afternoon and where they organized giant parties that had awakened the neighbors. They left the building without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent recurrence of the situation.
“From now on, the entrance will be monitored,” the administrator said.
The occupiers who took 11 out of 13 apartments in a given building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water facilities, in addition, painted walls and left garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments were held huge parties, which lasted up to two days and awakened other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The disco owner emphasizes that the building’s occupiers made it unfairly competitive because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to the actions of neighbors due to noise. But the problems were not caused by visitors to the disco, but by the residents of the busy house, and especially by those who participated in the parties organized here, whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks have increased, according to the angry inhabitants of the area.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months forgiving her rent.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the city group of the People's Party of PP at the Town Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for “the building to be moved immediately and thus to put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area.”
The president of the people explained that only one floor had been taken a year ago, but in recent months, the occupiers have reached all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them even stolen.
In this regard, he added that “one must end impunity and be consistent when it comes to acts against the civil responsibility that took place in the building.”
The city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 a.m. 30 minutes, the police reached building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of writing a procedure that carries more than a polemic about honoraries
The 16-way city selection process is once again opening up a debate about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the largest flowering of the already extinct Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the Central Park of New York.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the axis of the north-south, but above (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola’s qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi bear.
This was the position until September when the town hall declared a mega contest consisting of 16 bankruptcys on the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate in the field.
Is there a single question: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
During the competition, both purely organisational and based on a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It’s already as sober as when two members of this old caste chosen at a meeting in the elevator shake their hand.
And it was this work that sparked one of the rare consonances between what the three Barcelona architects and the precursor university professors think.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the tender has its reasons.
According to Roldan, after the issue of the Gulf Party was started, the ‘mountain side’ should also be discussed, so Ildefons Cerd’s speech on green apples was not drawn to an end.
“We must base ourselves on the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex,\" said the architect, for whom the name \"gates to Collserola\" carries a \"lexicological trap\": we must not imagine them - as entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to operate -
Modol, as well as Roland and Bayon, with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifys for a proposal as an “intellectual challenge” that offers some dangers.
The dangers arising from the “uncertainty” presented today by the public space project - after the experience of the 1980s, which had its swan singing in the Forum area -
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
To define something is to take the next step - it is basically to move on.
“It is necessary to remember the new urban and planning tools, because those present (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan) can cause a real disaster,” he said.
By focusing more in detail on the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be - considered a park - but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, which - must not end up in the garbage field - although it welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its Bureau that it will hit the project from - the first moment -
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of release that allows architects to engage in a debate, but “doubts” that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams - it’s all about skills - he adds) that need to be created: “Architecti should only be tools -
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the title of this game is complex, because there is no global vision of Collserola in the tender documents: ‘16 selection procedures have been announced, which deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole -
This makes him, at least, enroll in all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a single gate project can encounter the concept and definition of an architect's neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located directly above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire length of the zone of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino has forgiven Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal agent Cadino Red granted mercy to his brother, Mayor Monterrey, in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal agent of Casino Red gave him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which discussed the case of blackmail in which the brother of Mayor Monterrey was charged.
Following the assassination at Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had asked him to pay an economic quota to allow the town hall in Monterrey to operate illegally in a betting house.
Following the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office launched the prosecution of the brother of the panist mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent, the number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antigua, in the capital of the state.
He remained there the following 49 days after the second arrest order was issued and a public ministry agent disproved the possibility of co-participation or organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta for suspicion of blackmailing owners of Casin Red with a sum of one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in a prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in city halls in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that almost two months later, sufficient evidence was collected to prove Jonas's guilt, such as the payment of 1.5 million peso by the casino's representative in exchange for the promise that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casina Red, Major Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region. On this basis, he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal hearing, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been corrected and who of the companions decided to grant grace, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file of 197/2011, it is granted legal grace to Jonas Larrazabal. In the process which was conducted against him, no complaint will be possible. It is also impossible to claim compensation for damage or punishment.
After recalculation with a legal representative at around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanez, came to prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that he was granted official grace and his case was postponed to the archive.
He was also told that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the air accident, which killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and another seven people.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an investigation into an accident that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people show that the helicopter had hit the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said the pilot had stated that the climate conditions of the flight allowed before the launch of the aircraft.
“Parts that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings have become involved in the tree branches 25 meters from where the unit has lost its corpse.”
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, so it met all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the field of impact.
In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft are not located elsewhere, so the plane came across the mainland as a whole.
The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is most important to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director-general of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at a cruise speed and there was an accident on a soft ascending terrain.
“This information supports the hypothesis that it was a normal overflight operation in the event of an accident,” he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome named six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at launch, and the aircraft progresses towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of cloud at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to clouds, the crew were looking for a lower area and greater visibility until the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar helicopter are identical, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption to the flight trajectories prior to the impact.
Dispersal of aircraft residues in limited territory:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that an impact occurred on a straight trajectorium and from the side.
A diagram of the dispersion of the aircraft's remains indicates that at the time of the impact on the mainland, the helicopter was whole.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the site of the accident that would indicate that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that several contacts with the mainland may have occurred.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is considered, the inclination height goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images that were likely to break down along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have come into contact with the country in several places.
After a careful search around the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in an area more extensive than the area of detection, which strengthens the idea that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was still whole.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance launches research into a gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research with the aim of discovering a gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. Research called “Obesity genetics in children and adolescents” will allow to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report by the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinveststav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
A wide public with or without permission can participate in the research. People can come to the participating sports centers of the IMSS in Valle de México, where each council will run tests from 8 o'clock.
He stressed that the research began at the Sport Centre Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and since October 8 this activity is also carried out in the Sports Centre of Nezhualcóyolt (East of the Mexican State).
As soon as data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Sports Center of Independence (south of the Federal District) and eventually at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the ingredients and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to track down risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thus preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He stated that every Saturday, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) are carried out, blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined, and genes are being studied (trying to identify genes involved in the formation of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said this research reflects the health concerns of health care professionals over the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys experienced an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%. A dramatic increase also occurred in overweight,' said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that an average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in genes that are responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that general obesity genetics is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they get an overall assessment of the condition of children, thus finding out whether they show some known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of wrinkles of dark color (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that a given individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
The information is confidential so far, doctors pass it on in writing to their parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order to avoid their children’s diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, a full-day sitting before television and the use of means of transport instead of walking at short distances.
Overweight also causes a large calorie intake, that is, a greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no excuses in Asphalt from UNAM.
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, independently of climatic conditions and temperature.
If the pavement had been properly taken care of, almost 200,000 excavations would not have to be repaired after each period of rain in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, Rafael Herrera Najér, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement were adequate, there would have been a significant limitation of the excavations, or could even be completely removed.
In his lecture, The Technological Cause of Embodiment, which he spoke within the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, thereby creating a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of eccentricities.
He explained that asphalt, the most difficult part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight, which are called asphalt, and others with a low molecular weight, which are called Malteses. Together they add asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The Viskoelastic character of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it acts as a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, a chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible tile, made up of six layers of materials, three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers there is an asphalt insert, made up of small stones poured in asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms a insert is to pour asphalt.
When driving a car or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the tile will break down well.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would break down even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that on the asphalt insert the last layer called a coat, formed by a fine stone, i.e. sand also poured in asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since as part of the pavement will be exposed to a large load, it must have sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great effect on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it is difficult to get out, it causes softening of all layers of tiles and thus the formation of wreaths.
He explained that during the formation of excisions, the film of the mantle is first destroyed and only after that there is damage to the asphalt insert. However, there is no damage at one moment, but it is a slow process, which should stop already at the first stamps using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in the formation of wreaths, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load on the vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load will not exceed. Only in this way can we prevent frequent formation of outages.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries and allow us to easily repair the protrusions without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle is the 14th title of the first multimission.
Valle del Cauca did not reach Miss Colombia again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with the fact that she was at the stage of the winners, gaining a silver crown and sherpa, on the basis of which she became the new first multimission of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and the scepter took over Miss Atlántico, the mentioned department won the 14th title of the first multimission. Melina thus joined the teams of women from Valle del Cauca, who came to the reach of the winning crown, but were finally declared the first multimiss. Among them were the Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question many people ask themselves.
The result is the defeat of a large favorite woman who, in all previous rounds, showed that she has the ability to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain to become the Queen's Police and the Most Beautiful Face of the Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Italiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which subsequently also received the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that the jury decided to name it was only the First Multimission, is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: “Which book you liked the most and why”, which Martín Murillo Gomez from Leamos’ literary editor.
The candidate answered the question:
“I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it’s one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me the most in my childhood was a “Small Prince”, a very deep book.
Currently I read “Crime and Punishment” as part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author. This is a beautiful book titled “El ardor de la sangre”
This answer did not like, on the one hand, the term ‘culturalize’, and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what individual books had noted to her.
At the end of the solemn ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and was happy with the result: “The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. A little prince is a wonderful book.
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of a favorite.
Bogot’s journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, the most celebrated, and the one who received all the previous prizes (The Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and Queen’s mother), raised the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on the scene.
It was visible at the first presentation of swimmers on the beach of Hilton and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was shining on both, she knew she lacked the strength and inflammation that the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program “As At Home” at Canal RCN, believes that Melinda won the title of the first multimission confirms that the candidate who won the most titles in the competition does not eventually leave with the Queen’s crown”
In addition, Valle has held a rather unfriendly attitude towards the media in recent days and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just to the edge, two days before the election of the international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
“In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, there is something more to be seen than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates before entering the competition are involved in such projects,” she explained.
She also speculates that the candidate Valle has lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was visible on the back. But this is completely contrary to the jury’s verdict, which chose her miss-natural beauty-for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the Queen, admits that Melina had no best body, that there were better girls, - but problems with fibrosis on the back, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points until the last day -
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
Surgical interventions are okay, but they failed in Valle.
The body has never been its strong side, and here it has chosen its own tax.
Because of this award, which was given for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the performance in the swimwear, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was a satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had allowed to eventually grant her the highest crown.
Whether it’s true or not, it’s certain that Melina today started her year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it will be written in history as one of the queens, who, despite the overwhelming success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the people of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfons Cana.
A fingerprint expert from Cali entered history as a man who confirmed his death, Alphonsa Cana.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On 4 November last year, a CTI fingerprint expert in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the top Farc leader: “Alfonse Cana” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week was a series on Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada, who has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital Valle and, after taking the appropriate courses, began to specialize in fingerprinting. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. palms of hands and feet.
In the week when the operation was carried out against that Alfonsi Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses and suspect that one of them was the man who led the oldest Guerilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillerm Leon Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where the corpse was located, he did not know him because of his physical appearance. He looked completely different from in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton dandelion, ink and transplant and light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with the card entries.
The eye didn’t disappoint her: it was ‘Alfonso Cano’.
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm that he was the top commander of Farc, Juan Carlos Pinzón.
Finding a stop
For the Dactyloscope of Sijin de Cali, the recognition that Elizar González was shown to President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of operational service against “Can” is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help research crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many criminals present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for the collection of prints, but in this case we could get a full-hand print and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts - he recalled.
Fingerprints may also confirm or refute suspicions in case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the copy on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was really a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the items are being printed ‘scarved using chemical or physical reactive substances’.
When it appears, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or to the Register.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians currently, whose data is not reported anywhere,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that is shimmering, gold is not, not everything you touch, there are traces.
However, if it can be used, a corresponding comparison must be made.
Indignation: protests in New York City
Hundreds of manifestos were in distress at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stand.
A large part of them waited for the order to clean up the space and moved to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, New York City officials were provoked by the Manor of the Manor, when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, where they were brought out in the morning, and then tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of manifestos were in distress at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allowed the “indigenous” to return to the place. The second part of the movement responded to the cleaning by taking the park in the north of the city where further detention took place.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the statutory battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful manifestations,” said one of the spokespersons of the movement, “Let’s take over Wall Street, Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the response “indigenous” to the eviction of the camp, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting violent eviction of the site and allowing the manifests to continue to stand there.
In addition, they also took another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and 6th Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the farm plot in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take the place, but then the police came and arrested some of the manifests. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw the attachments being deployed to some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site, and there will also be a delegation of religious representatives to give them support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the transferred manifestoes even distributed and distributed copies of the court order, and even gave them to the people who guarded the square, causing some small clashes, Bray said, who condemned the fact that some police officers were beating the manifesto.
A court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or using laws that were published after the closure began or prohibiting manifestoes from accessing the park with shops or other places they used before.
The mayor Bloomberg told the press that the city had suspended the opening of the public space due to this court order and warned the manifesto that local laws would not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city’s top official personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the Manifestots were infringing the law.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it became “a place where people did not go to protest, but to violate laws, and in some cases to harm others” because “some shops received threatening letters” and “neighbors feared about the quality of their lives”
“The morning cleaning was terrible and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” said a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of ‘does not value freedom of expression’.
Representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also said they were planning to organise “big events” on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which protests took place, as they began on September 17.
Carmel Anderson will present the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show \"It's a Russell Peters Christmas\" on December 1st.
She was Tim Allen’s assistant in “Home Improvement”, a swimmer in “Baywatch”, a rabbit in “Playboy”, the wife of a year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show of Canadian television.
The private television station CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the song singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show \"It's a Russell Peters Christmas\" on December 1, and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a TV show in which Anderson, also known for her internet pornographic pictures, appears with her ex-wife, Mötley Crüe, Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding the doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comician of Indian origin, has recently been performing as a tour moderator, My Violent Torpedo of Truth, Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters will appear on a special Christmas CTV broadcast by Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called an American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York-Liks.
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and ends the period of downturns that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
Tokyo’s first estimates of material losses amounted to 300,000 million dollars, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, heals well.
After three quarters of declines, the GDP value between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% a year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan, the tax year starts in March 2012 - in addition, they predict the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending decreased by 0.9% from January to March. This is the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis to get out of it, or to restore infrastructure.
Japan has awakened, particularly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased vehicle, travel and leisure expenses.
Stigma yenu
Flows have come into the hands of the internal market when yen-Japanese currency has become one of the “sustainable values” for investors who are fleeing from the euro area debt crisis and from alarming US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a big burden for export businesses.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to the yen course in September.
While markets continue to be besieged by EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
“We have to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, the State Secretary for Economic Policy.
Indeed, perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area even got below the average, which is at 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens once again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written commitment
With fast and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty once again, Greece is becoming increasingly involved in the labyrinth, which leads to the exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the new transitional Greek government is being given the requirements of Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the chairman of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would in no way support and repeated his request for a new election on the expected date of February 19.
“The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October,” Papadimos said during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the government.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform the Disciplinary Code of Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clarify any doubt as to his position: “We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have no longer committed ourselves to anything else.”
The president of the Conservatives went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but at the same time declared that it would not support and sign any commitment regarding the implementation of the austerity measures.
The European Commission, already affected by the impact of playing with the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands were insurmountable: it would not block any assistance if the new government and the representatives of the main parties did not sign the written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible -
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return to Athens very soon and will deal with the new government about what it needs to pay the sixth part - 8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
The Greek wing has a little more to knit from.
Queen Sofia: “There are instruments for progress and hope”
Queen highlights Spain’s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain has achieved a significant global position with regard to microfinance.
Queen Sofia said yesterday that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity.
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Microloans Summit in Valladolid, with the conviction that \"there is no doubt\" that this type of operation is absolutely necessary, in order to achieve the goals of the millennium set by the UN by 2015. \"The issue is to meet the goals to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, i.e. the amount that sets the poverty threshold.\"
Spain - will continue to work - and expand the network of volunteers - in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly - emphasized Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, - will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women - to whom these loans are primarily destined.
“We have achieved many, many, and many, challenges are still ahead of us.”
The micro-loans summit should not only be a discussion forum, but also a platform to support the basic objectives.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that 100 million families would get above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-loans has spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after the pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus, the Queen said, adding that it is an act of justice and the necessary recognition.
She described the father of this instrument as “an admirable idealist who set out on the path of combating poverty” - she met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006. “At all these meetings, I was able to see a constant development,” explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned her the title “head of the family” in Valladolid, which she was granted the “movement of the poor” in Valladolid.
Queen Sofia ended her performance by calling on participants to engage in discussions and search for a solution, thus allowing them to continue their fight against poverty.
-Ethical imperative -
Secretary of State Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity is an ethical imperative that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balo-comfort, because this cooperation is a “permanent obligation”
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a “serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty” and now more than ever the governments of developed countries must work in line with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to become a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secrets for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving trust to the people to whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants in the city, who -opens his gates to the spirit of solidarity, which is contagious -
CDU proposes to elect European President on the basis of universal electoral law
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Christian Democratic Party President Angela Merkel held the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU) on Monday, November 14th.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it was not until autumn, especially to satisfy the members of the parties who consider the policy of the government today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes later, Angela Merkel’s opening of the show, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the answer to the crisis - not less Europe, but more Europe -
Not just because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”
The Chancellor in Europe says that the time for change has arrived.
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area Member States, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal electoral law - with a view to giving Europe one face -
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary move: the UK is opposed, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is set.
In the same way, delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country at the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will clearly result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Leaded by concerns about calming the climate inside her party, the Chancellor made several references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to get a congress by talking about “small” European states or about states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of French-German friendship, Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humble defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in inability to work?
Following the aids, the UMP Party and the government are launching an offensive against labour incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will give a speech on a topic that has been repeated since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on the inability to work.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of inability to work before they start taking support in the disease.
Without the consent of the company, the employee who gets sick would lose four days of pay, at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
As well as measures that would be accompanied by other symbolic measures: to give civil servants one day unenforced incapacity (until they have no inability compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are debated, the right-wing majority also launches a fraud theme that focuses this time on the evils associated with the inability to work.
“The controls will be much more extensive, and in addition: if caught, you will be returned,” said Xavier Bertrand during an interview with the RTL station on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate due to the truth about the inability to work.
In fact, these have been subject to constant surveillance since 2002 and the political insurgence that have yielded their fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s first stop at several official numbers.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance Maladia (CNAM) more than EUR 237 million daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Care, in 2008, daily compensation with €11.3 billion accounted for 5% of healthcare spending.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity contributions and occupational accidents, and 54% concerned inability to work, i.e. €6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of healthcare costs.
According to Alma Consulting, in 2010, France had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which contains some deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the Monster.com job opportunities site showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French employees responded that they did not choose any unemployment day.
Another study, carried out by the disease insurance institutions, explains that in 2010 37.8% of the inability to work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no more than elsewhere prone to inability to work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating at work is a very small part compared to working black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small scales.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused systematic controls aimed at incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM stated that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term inability - unauthorized or too long - i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of ‘unadapted or unauthorized’ were counted at 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 “unauthorized” cases for several million employees who had work inability.
A number that represents much less than the number expressing work on black.
According to MP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would amount to 9 to 15 billion euros missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words to parliament, adding that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
“To put our economy back on track, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan,” the head of government said on Wednesday when he gave his first public speech at the start of a debate to vote on trust in parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit will be a \"main task\" - the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in the game, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be from now until the end of the year - around 9% - of gross domestic product after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for the already approved measures to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
“We do not raise our hand for any new measures,” Samaras stressed in a meeting with the MPs on his side of the New Democracy.
We have agreed to the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says committee of experts
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, death is denied to Canadians.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society has the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government change criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary in a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote a recent survey of the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in Quebec, this number is the highest with 86% of people killed in the hospital.
As for the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons who are inappropriate or non-consent.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downe, co-author of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases of these overwhelmings yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“Assistant suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downe.
Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Recall that according to an investigation conducted by the Venus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of old or disabled people are worth less.
As far as people practicing assisted suicide are concerned, 41% of those surveyed say they should not be prosecuted.
In the matter of maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional doctors to be educated to respect the rejection of end-of-life treatment without fearing prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or final quieting already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission calls for it to be regarded as euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already made their reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a medical law specialist, has qualified the position of report-signator experts as “extreme”, among other things, because he does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick at the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old could ask him to help commit suicide,” says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks like the authors of the report have built the autonomy of a person above all the other values that shape the social bias of society.
For “in society,” he says, there are warning signs and restrictions.
Medical Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a “manifest for euthanasia”
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly concerned about the data of the report on the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan king calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus is talking about “complet.”
Syria is increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad last night manifested before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists and talks about “compulsion” against his country, became more intense.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership of the Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, countries neighbouring Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad’s departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where some forty civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed.
“If Bashar had the interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” said King Jordan, a country adjacent to Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, head of Turkish diplomacy, regretted that the efforts of Turkish mediation under the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year were not crowned by success.
“Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, citing neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is applying increasingly hard lines.
The United States has been ranked as “strengthening the consensus against Assad and the unfair conduct of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly tougher tone to repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this NGOs, two other civilians were killed - in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar - in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had “goed out of crisis”
He also responded lively to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus’s membership, which he said was a dangerous step.
Syria has added with confidence that “compulses against Syria will not succeed”
Following his decision to suspend Syria, the League of Arab States is currently planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is also favorably inclined to send UN observers in order to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime he believes is “paranoid.”
A new special meeting of the League is being called for tomorrow to take an opinion on the resolution plan, which was decided on 2 December, and in particular the withdrawal of armies from the cities plagued by dispersion and the liberation of imprisoned manifestos.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the decision of the Arab League to be “unquestionable” yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a resolution plan, while completely avoiding the support of any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time and sacrifice in Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that will include \"sacrifice\" in order to regain the credibility lost in recent months by the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should assemble a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
“Monti spoke about an important program with many victims,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the designed Prime Minister.
Gianfranco Finni, President of the Chamber of Deputies, expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express his confidence on Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with the presentation of a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In “democracy,” the exact terms apply - in terms of preparation of the government and its agenda, he stressed and added that it is “certain that markets will be patient and understand.”
His appointment as president was favorably accepted by the markets from the beginning, but the concern came back after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team including mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept even “policy”
He expressed his conviction that the new government would remain until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the new government will be trusted by parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti, after joining office, promised to act with extreme urgency and to make Italy a strong link to Europe again.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn’s spokesperson stressed that, even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change.
The European Union believes that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its 2013 balanced budget and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria’s head of business Emma Marcegagli, who meets Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy, because a country that doesn’t show growth can’t adhere to deficit parameters.
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, the “professor”, symbolic of the authors of the introductory “call to seriousness” and “other Italy”, represents an epoch change for Italy after 17 years of Berlusconism.
The time of life of his team will be unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place government bonds for €200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helps Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in atomic risks said Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents leaked from the UN agency.
Last week, the MAAE announced its “serious concern” regarding the “potential military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS, which is widely drawn from the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was to work three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to produce synthetic diamonds using an explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to establish a production company in Kiev -nano-diamanty -
His company’s economic difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was to cooperate on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In his latest report, the MAAE recalls clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State told the agency, worked during a substantial part of his work career on this technology under the country’s military nuclear programme, where it came from.
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published Monday, the number of crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or little increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase from the 13% in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes in total.
The total number of “hate crimes” has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% were religious differences according to the FBI.
“After the loss in 2009 it is disturbing to see these crimes and the crimes rise again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, “the rise in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the leaders of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these evils,” he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports on ‘hate crimes’.
“A hateful crime,” he said, “in American federal law, is the legacy of a time of civil rights struggle.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook.
The Twitter microblogging site introduced changes in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the follow-up activity, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New offers -action - and -name - allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who are following you or people whose answers - tweets - are being followed by you.
This allows you to know if they allow you to track your posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested - in August, on a small percentage of users - before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP spokesperson Carolyn Penner told Twitter.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday pour commander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre Ainsi and un public plus large avec un maniement plus compatible and culi des résaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their tweets - differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s unnecessary, it takes up a lot of space, and it’s too much like Facebook,” says @jemb123.
“Activity will help me to follow some of my Twitter elements better,” he sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the Golden Rule on a Balanced Budget to the Constitution
The government of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enroll “golden rule” budget policies into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid any reduction in Austria’s rating by rating agencies (AAA).
He was himself a socio-democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the end of the ministers' consultation in a situation where Austrian public debt is with its 74.6% high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% established by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, Christian democrat.
Austria follows a request from the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where heads of state and government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 a reduction in public deficit and the achievement of a public account balance be entered in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the German model - Germany was the first European country to adopt such a rule.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and as of 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries as well as municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to get in the 2020/21 horizon of public debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong Jen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they had to continue to strengthen.
“We will intervene as we have done last time, if we find out too much instability,” said Senate President Y. Noda in the exchange rate.
On Tuesday, he was forced to return to historical values, which forced Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has only recently exceeded the dollar record valid since 1945.
But only since then has the regularly promoted purchases of investors who consider it a “safe port” in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar was again below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell under a symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This inflammation of the Japanese currency harms island exports as it costs the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of proceeds earned by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
“Japan is recovering from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that ravaged the Tohoku region in the north-east of the country,” said Noda, fearing that the price tag would not kill a fragile recovery in the egg.
The third economic power of the world has renewed growth in the third quarter (1.5% due to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households burdened with disasters.
But the Prime Minister said the high value of Jenu did not reflect Japan's \"national economy\" -
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on Japan’s central bank (BoJ) to launch a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the multi-governor of Hirohide Yamaguchi said that the BoJ had previously taken “suitable measures” suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Emissions increased its purchases of state Treasury vouchers by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) and increased the ceiling to 55,000 billion yen (€519 billion) for purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
Prices are rising, exchanges are failing.
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European Stock Exchange is still concerned about the stability of the euro area and is now falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points in 10 hours.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
“With new tensions around the yields from euro area loans that are in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to make only part of recent profits,” he said.
“Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo storm was closing with a fall of 0.7%, which suffered due to market concerns about Europe’s ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This restarting uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which is continuing its decline on Tuesday.
The euro reaches its lowest level from a month and a half ago.
At 10 p.m., the European currency has a value of $1.3570 at a retreat of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency was couffled after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal on Monday to leave the euro area for countries in trouble without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting South European countries' interest rates, but also in France, continue to strengthen market concerns.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has strongly called for time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit would be a \"main task\" for his government.
Spain is again in a deliberate line of markets when elections to the Chamber of Deputies are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread difference between the ten-year bonds between Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expectations of euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say France recorded a 0.4% economic growth in the third quarter due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised the number down for the second quarter to fall by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter that makes economics more concerned.
During the same period Germany registered growth by 0.5%.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11am, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts have to win over the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their attitude on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will cause doubled electricity demand by 2050 if we don’t want much of the world’s population to get rid of an important part of life.
At the same time, the lack of fossil resources will have to be faced in order to continue to produce electricity, and it is not to be forgotten that it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is an issue which is currently missing from ecological debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find any other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the last generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island plant crash.
If a German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality is opposed.
Berlin’s choice will be reflected in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European wind power champion, of which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which is why CO2 emissions and the price of Danish electricity are 65% or 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay an invoice for electricity 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised energy economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping the industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the advantages of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay as well as does not substantially oppose this energy, as public opinion surveys show.
Let us remind you that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and with 41,000 new jobs.
The heavily exporting sector has drawn a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these SMEs and lost 6 billion euros a year for the exports of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to work for 60 years while the fall of its manufacturer would be planned?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, even there is no devilic one.
The development of low-carbon installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA shows the complementaryity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which conducts uncompromising and transparent surveillance of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island was in normal operation and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it did from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and constructors is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in building a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to the competitors offered by AREVA and EDF and releasing the way to take on leadership positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogma and machinations dominate the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from various angles - the engulfment of police, courts and administrations subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the “country of human rights” that France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment, the object of which were foreign students, which became current when the Minister of the Interior (see Liberation letter of 23 May) declared that France - does not need foreign talents, masons and serviers -
But until now, it has rarely been disassembled at the angle of the economy.
It is necessary to say that there is quite a broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, in 1976, Jacques Chirac made a statement that “900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrants are located” and on the left Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France could not accept all the misery of the world.”
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of hordes of Polish installers on the French territory was shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are trying to provide to immigrants.
In its program François Hollande is limited to banality when he states that joint development will allow us to solve our ‘migration problem’.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem is possible in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.): among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Restriction of immigration is hindering growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the effects caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and put pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are far more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing jobs in sectors with shortage of staff.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
As a surgeon will have difficulties working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this addition between the French and the migrants causes the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
While it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought about by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in Europe at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, an immigrant coming at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of €10000 for his entire life to public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate of desire to achieve a missing percentage of growth - with award-winning teeth -
These teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century by the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also the Franca in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that in order for democracy to triumph decisively over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and perform it as directly as possible.
It is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
Universal electoral law, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a condition sufficient and can become a tool of oppression, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, separation organization and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been so since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The confession of the error of the Greek referendum-type yes-no will have the value of double disclosure in this respect: the revelation of the need for a great return of political power, but also the revelation of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought out so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic intricacies have moved today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot obtain anything if we require a number of national referendums organized according to necessity and disorganizedness.
Bianko exposed to a European absolutist monarch or jump to an empty nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we don't want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn't even know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows ahead of the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies that suffers from their inability and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the management of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will assume decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands the European economic government.
Come on.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European building.
In order to form a republic in France, it was necessary to \"be\" Republicans.
The revolution in interests was not enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and true European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
Contactless - chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Card Fair opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in the world sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM cards) of 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most important is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay in public transport or deal with purchases by simply zooming in the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards should be sold worldwide against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should continue to rise in 2012 (the expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After being long in the APEC country lift, Europe is gaining land in contactless payment.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to rank a higher speed level, it is necessary for the bank to equip their clients from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing touchless bank cards to their clients in the future,” reports Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage of the payment medium of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
They have been delayed -
“But their true expansion should take place next year,”
“For 2012 we estimate their sales in the world of 80 to 120 million units,” says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are volumes of the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algiers’ deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Mesahel admitted that Algiers had now “acquired” about it.
“The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is great cooperation between them,” he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by members of the AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers in an operation carried out by special French troops.
French and Nigerian investigators found several phones with chips belonging to terrorists in the rubble after the intervention.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
“It’s progress, but no doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we talk about an operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
-But it's possible -
“We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself more and more actively - the moderate statements of the Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this “support” has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same method of execution as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has put in place.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Fast success
Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around Mosque, School and Fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means \"Western education is sin\" in the language of Haoussa - approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict respect for Sharia’s Islamic law, while its supporters are starting a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government’s response is the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf sect is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its centre in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he will carry out an assassination in the city of Jos, in which 80 people will die, then another in the capital of Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police command in his first suicide attack.
In August, the United Nations Office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying about all security specialists.
Now that the Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and iger, and the Somalis of the Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said France was in a state of emergency and is ready to “sell all information”
The World According to Candidates for President
On issues relating to China, Iran or Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are overestimating simplification and ignorance.
Can America’s weakened crisis manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating the loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or Israel’s help come together.
Mitt Romney, the best-ranking candidate in the Republican nomination race - Grand Old Party - threatened the profession of Chinese people in front of the World Trade Organization and their allegations - due to the manipulation of their currency - which is a leading topic in America by the widespread migration of entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse, if this must include the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost failed in an attitude that “contaminates” emotions.
He called for a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current stance of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in the election estimates, remains unobtrusive.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop his nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will arrest Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance by accuseing Obama of failing in his duties towards the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates the embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capacity” - a clearly unknown fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he is ready to send the US Army to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
All of them are far away from Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the expeditious departure of the “boys” from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute him to the label of the weak.
But the attack is not easy.
The population assesses President Obama’s national security policy, which has been removed by Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to absconding.
And with arguments that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama knocks to the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe and led by the Baltic Sea bottom began to function.
It must supply gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated last Tuesday in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned the Russian gas control valve into a Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow to Western Europe every year by the first 1 224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Federal Land of Mecklenburg-Pomorany.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the amount equal to the entire French consumption.
And it is already reminded of the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building has the nature of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries protested strongly against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being run by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats of closing access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
This was more strongly expressed by Warsaw, when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the “new German-Soviet Pact”, citing an alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that it is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater assurance of its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created cracks between Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia barely managed 5 years ago to advance its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose bearings are approaching their end.
“This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically,” said François Fillon, in a ceremony opening this pipeline and demonstrating at what point large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The submarine pipe is made of steel with a concrete shell to protect it from anchors of marine vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid mine fields from World War II.
“For safety reasons, nearly a hundred had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
The protection of fauna and flora was also to be increased.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffels, which is not cut off by valves or maintenance stations for all its length.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but the project managers rejected it when the Swedes were little willing to see the Russian state company, as it permanently settles off their coast.
“In the event of a failure, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leaks, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since welds were designed to cause leaks once every 100,000 years.
Controlling the state of the pipeline from the outside is carried out by an underwater robot drawn by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is printed with gas.
For the entire three days of the 3 m/s journey, the target will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
For the implementation of this project, the forces of five companies joined together.
Gazprom, who holds a 51% stake, remains the head of the position.
German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch company Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in the city of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years with a contract that could be renewed, all of its capacity for gas transport.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,” said Jens Müller.
The financing of pipeline construction was ensured from 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach €7.4 billion for both pipes.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned to them, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The 4,5-meter-high valves form the gas outlet gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to the German pipelines.
As of last Tuesday, the terminal receives 1 million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
In achieving full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to re-establish the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular plates and its leaves sent white as if over time aged.
Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At the time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a new design but distinguishing notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is considering the introduction of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique - Moleskin - (skin imitation), which is used for e.g. to adjust the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
Moleskine returned to his favorites an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century, says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle on 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from classified production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to assemble an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will capture the business as well as the student or professionals.
The image of Moleskine's notebook is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated, and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, today has almost one hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and through the chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the centers of cities where he can assert his identity.
“We have watched the spirit of time and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition - Zacházka - where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarn Film Festival, she also released a new recordboard resembling the leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases ... The brand expands to a variety of carriers.
The success of the envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe investment funds, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the proportion of unemployed workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today opens 15th Week for the employment of the disabled.
Despite the voluntarian public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it daunting?
-No, underscored by Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled -
The progress made in 15 years is remarkable.
At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher.
But there is still much to be done -
It should be said that many obstacles to their entry into work persist for unemployed people.
This is an older person: 37% is over 50 (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a degree, and only 10,000 are disabled from 2.3 million college students.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent the core of the problem, according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses receive disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There is no question, there are ways of thinking that are definitely evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that asked managers have a low level of knowledge of disabled persons with an excessive idea of people in a mobile chair and mental or mental deficiencies.
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the goal of employing 6% of the disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which came from 2008, indicate a condition equal to 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, who is charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with this law.
It is evidenced by the number of companies fined, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 more guilty enterprises to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc.
But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises.
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers versus 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: “What a happiness”
Before Tuesday evening (20h45), French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that would bring them this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the grandstand of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled well.
Five months after his attacker’s angry gesture in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach only sent words of praise to his player.
“I am very happy with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country.”
“I want to move forward,” said Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, he apologizes -
“I’ve been in Lille for a whole year, which is not the case with Belgium.”
“I need to clean my brand.”
Gambling, saved against Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally “lighten up”
The concept of “joy” cannot be overlooked.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from 7 years and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he said.
This necessarily contributes even more to the “special” nature of this meeting.
More so, because opposite them are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), he recalls.
\"We were crucified immediately.\"
“You can play against them, it’s just a pleasure.”
Leekens
-Dress - win - match - holiday -
- Proudness - also to state with the quality of the neighbors - that France became a team of very high levels a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna - once again
“Laurent Blanc has done a great job, he’s outraged.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French direction... Brazil.
“Our little Belgians will become big,” he said.
“We’re building something, players are ambitious, they’re healthy hungry.”
Be aware of this for the next matches, including France.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is launching a great optimism against Bosnia and Herzegovina (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football team, which has been in charge since 2010, qualifys for Euro 2012.
Portugal is 90 minutes away from happiness.
There's one game left and one opponent - Bosnia.
In the knowledge of Friday's result, in the hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of predominance, but it was unable to score such a rare goal that would relieve it.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk because we didn’t go outside.”
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that he will go ahead of the audience, which should create a boiling boiler there, even though the match definitely appears to be - very balanced - says the optimistic, but cleverly mindful Bento.
“We expect a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can have a top-up,” Portuguese coach said in a statement.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012”, the successor to Carlos Queiroze relativized.
The undecided Friday match in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to set a goal and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for Bosnians who also need to score a goal.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk, because we didn’t have a goal out there,” Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has high technical quality and has players with high individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the very beginning, so that they don’t have time to think.
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
