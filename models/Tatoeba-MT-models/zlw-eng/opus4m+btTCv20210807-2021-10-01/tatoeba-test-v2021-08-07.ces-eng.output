According to the Tatoeba directives, members are advised to either add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally speaking sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. Please translate the sentence only if you know with certainty what it means.

He knows the wines.
Pollution can be regulated.
For some reason, I feel more alive at night.
The captain suddenly left the ship.
She abused my ignorance.
They're abusing me.
You abuse your authority.
Destroy your enemies: make them your friends.
You'll be happy again.
I told them again to shut down the radio.
I'll read it again.
Snow fell from the sky with rain.
Juggling is another thing that I'm not good at.
They fucked it.
They sing in the choir.
She sang a song, smiling at me.
It didn't attract me from the beginning.
A cat came from under the desk.
Two boys came out of the room.
The report of Tom's death saddened me.
I caused him a lot of problems.
She betrayed me, I'm disappointed.
The apple fell from the tree.
I got hurt.
The mirror is stunned.
The mirror is intimidated.
The mirror broke.
They set up a new company in London.
I rarely see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd cancel all the slaughterhouses if I could.
You canceled the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
She rose her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from this book.
You're fat.
I wouldn't make fun of that.
Tom is now a man.
He's wasting his time.
The loss of work she loved so much was a blow to her.
We lost all our gear.
He lost her.
I lost the umbrella that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost the umbrella that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost my key.
I lost all my friends.
You lost your head, didn't you?
He lost two sons in the war.
You'll lose your time.
Losing the job she loved so much was a tough blow to her.
She stiffened the knife.
They took part.
I took part in the debate.
I took part in the search.
I'd stay and talk, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We stayed quiet.
Stay home.
Will you stay or leave?
Will you stay or leave?
Stay where you are or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and close the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay in the motel.
I'm staying with you.
Curiosity over me has won.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get out of the chair and help!
We're inviting you.
We can do it better.
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
Can you handle it yourself?
I chose the path of the least resistance.
My phone's ringing!
The bells rang.
The bells started to ring.
They got it.
I turned my ankle.
We'll get used to everything.
I'm used to it.
The habit is the second nature.
I used to live alone.
I used to win.
You're used to not having a hot meal every day.
You'll get used to everything.
You'll get used to it.
