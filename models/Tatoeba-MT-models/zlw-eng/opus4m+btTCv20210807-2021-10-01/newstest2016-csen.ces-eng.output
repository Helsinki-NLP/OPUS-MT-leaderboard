In an emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During a call to the emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he was shooting his girlfriend and it was necessary to come home to them.
Lamb decided that his 'sweet dog' was alive and probably upset, and that contacts to the family of a dead woman could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the white office paper: “I’m so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she’s the only one who ever loved me,” it was in a letter signed by the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to a school campus where police think he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
The chief of police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said university staff heard shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
Lamb said he made a random phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after shooting at school, she forced students and the faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorized authorities were still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by investigators on the part of the state and the students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote in a thank-you-great people with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with other 17 faculty members, and many students attended courses at both of them.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shocked, “as if something wasn’t right with him.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was facing stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate, on which Lamb worked hard, would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
William LaForge, president of the University, said he didn’t know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “Mr. Lamb’s probably worried about something.”
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, the police caught his lead as he crossed the border of Arkansas back to Missippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gun shot at the court of the house about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed by the State Coroner of Washington, Methel Johnson.
The car left it on the street.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in a city that counts about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and lessons education.
In spring, he received a doctorate in education.
One of the longtime friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through friends.
She was with her friends at high school and he was the great older boy who taught her a few years to play guitar.
It was quite a heart breaker at the time.
The heart of all the girls came down as soon as it appeared,” says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly walked together for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that was adjacent to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
“She was completely broken,” O’Steen said of his daughter.
She was with her mother the best friend.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter, Abigail knew Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and basisd at the summer festival three years ago.
Later they played random gigs.
O'Steen said his daughter wrote and sang her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a bar-lit sporadic near Gautier, said he had last seen Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, the pot that Lamb played on guitar and harmonics for the countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
“He was just a happy couple,” he said.
We had a lot of fun and recorded each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a killed professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy student club and student government.
About 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and community members, participated in a candle reminder event at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the vigil during which the university congregation set up \"Bright Morning Star\" and \"Amazing Grace\"
On Wednesday, school began again.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this reportage.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police are now claiming that Lamb made a phone call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Less Seasonal Workers
Toys R Us says they won’t get as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturers of children’s toys and products say it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire around 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, a decrease from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting applicants this month, and the employees will receive during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily accept employees to assist in shopping and selling, for sending and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About Her 'Rande' With Princess Diana
The premiere of the future was a great professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there,” he said in a trailer for the upcoming document, “Leave in time.”
The film starts and I realize I'm within reach of something that could be called a fake date with a Princess from Wales.
Back in time, there is a documentary about 'Return to the Future', which lists interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premier for the future was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s really the best travel document ever filmed for me.”
Back in time - it will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General, says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that \"there is no military solution\" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The head of the UN again urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the Ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month due to a discussion of the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers had made this situation unsolvable.
Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching an Iranian nuclear deal in the resolution of the Syrian crisis.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump in Real Light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes opinions.
The others waved their hands like an unmanaged joke.
Some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are not doing it (until now).
10 out of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the leadership of a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what this means for the nominative chance of this real estate magnate.
Of course, it is still the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, eventually none of which won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might come across general elections.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will and are starting to interpret their dollars at a standstill in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that real estate magnate is not just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University’s vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative view of it.
And these numbers stick in the initial stages.
After a vote by Quinnipiac University last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiast” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be “indignant” from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enjoyed” against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unsatisfied” or “disturbed” if Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his incubation and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide inclined to the idea that the real estate has the right temperament for the president’s post, according to a Monday vote by ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senatorial club of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think they don’t have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say that their temperament doesn’t belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When he puts on his scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeba Bush.
The GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
In the past, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the candidate against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's possible nomination.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump also defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But Monmouth University’s early September survey shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates Trump will almost always receive majority support.
He leads over Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marc Rubie at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christ at 33 points for everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would lead a trader with 19 points in a one-to-one hypothetical match.
Most of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll shows that only half of Trump-supported voters say they won’t change their minds.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door for change among candidates.
However, Trump’s current most powerful opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump about immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violents” in his campaign’s announcement speech, immigration continues to hold as the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.
Some are concerned that Trump’s incubation pulls key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and damages will seek rebranding.
But according to a new Monday poll by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post on Monday say they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
They are also very angry with Washington.
A few weeks ago, the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were “unsatisfied” and 21 percent were “unsatisfied.”
The House supported a greater share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the upper law, which regulates the yield of fees on the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that they would get extra money from both the Treasury and the municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by opposition members who are concerned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, as they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House of First Reading supported a government amendment to the upper law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a large part of the yield of fees on the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67%, while the proportion of municipalities will be reduced from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The template also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for minerals that companies will benefit from.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
The revenue of municipal budgets is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, as the fee is to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipalities received around CZK 450 million and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
About 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were mined from coal mining.
The amendment also counts on an increase in the payment from the conquering areas with allowed mining to CZK 1000 per hectares per year.
The income from these payments shall continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that the village will gain 14 million to 100 million crowns a year.
The amount of the mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The payment shall be recalculated as the sum of the amount of mineral mined and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government regulation might not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Young, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral that is the state's property.
Fees shall be granted only to municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the city’s money and a quarter of the state’s money will be mined.
The same ratio will be the case in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the State collects on the fees of mining will be purposefully bound.
For example, 28% will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would damage the communities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and the Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they would pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
“It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget,” said David Kadner, who was elected in the U.S. region.
Hana Aulický, a member of the KSČM, warned of the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulický had proposed to reject the amendment unsuccessfully, and Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work on it.
According to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent of the long-term contract.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heating plants, should therefore not feel the price rise.
“But on the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees,” the government admits.
However, the increase in employment charges is a bearable one.
According to the rapporteur for Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for both the state and the village, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall only after 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
The cheerful will lead the Czechs as the one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Davis Cup bar in India on the board on Thursday, and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrat planned that due to difficult conditions he would break down the load on the entire quartet.
In Delhi there is hot and high air humidity, so demanding matches are expected, which can stretch up to five hundred.
We have to take this into account.
I'd like to spread it according to the weather.
And depending on what it will look like, he said he returned during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Radže Kumár Khánny.
With the team's number one and the world's 40, Jiří Veselý counts between Friday and Sunday.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably in position as two.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
I'm slow in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet,\" said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be Štěpánek’s participation in Saturday’s four-game.
It is only a question of who will stand next to the experienced deblazer who has 18:4 in the Davis Cup.
It's probably not funny.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavláska.
“I really don’t know who and what it will look like,” he said.
It will decide according to the development of two games.
The difference may be Pavlásek, with Veselý they surprised in the 1st round of the win in the debut over the Australians.
“He’s decent,” he said.
I managed to do it against Australia, and if I play, I would like to perform the same performance I have shown there since the second set.
“I would like to bring a point for these experiences,” said Pavlásek.
He will be joining Yuki Bhambri's doubles (125th in ATP), which won last week's Challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated the third and fourth hundreds of players.
The two will be Somdev Devarman (164.).
Both are Challengers players and ours are experienced in the ATP Tour, but many times we have already convinced ourselves that the Davis Cup rankings do not decide.
“He decides the current form, the weather,” he said.
Friday's opening doubles will start at 6:30 AM and can stretch due to weather.
According to the forecast, it has rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played with artificial lighting.
They've got it on fire, and it's got some 2,000 luxes, which is enough.
“It should be done under the lights,” he said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut in PMQ has been very enthusiastically expected
Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will put the first of his six questions to be asked shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he asked - less theatre and more facts -
He also said he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment in the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the center of attention of several stories on the headlines of the newspaper.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn’s spokesman said he would “standing in respectful silence” and that he would recognize the “hero of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that the Labour leader would recommend singing a national anthem, regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in the top team of Mr Corbyn, citing differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also \"fearing\" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's dose limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had proposed amendments to remove the whole idea of a dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party “very clearly” opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party to be faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas from the crowd on questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North says PMQs are too confrontative and that they will refrain from both “quickly” and “early” trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secret, will represent him at PMQ if he doesn't attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he had been told that he had still discussed the matter with House spokesman John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the style of politics, “Punch and Judah,” which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted that he failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of judgment of leaders, their leadership of the House and their attitude among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become cartoons and need far-reaching reforms.
Job in Joburg: Young homeless people trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a hard place for homelessness.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn and earn a living.
\"I was photographed in Joburg - a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Pound rises while salary growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following data and showed a recovery of British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was conducted above using the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This has been the fastest since 2009 and it looked like estimates are approaching when rates will rise.
Sterling increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% higher than the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a closer offer from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring closer brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch together.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the rival group of luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
The shares in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in Mondi’s packaging and paper group were the biggest decline in the index and dropped by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced its rating on the company’s ‘sales’
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company announced a 83% jump in the middle of the year in pre-tax profits of £46.6m
J.D. Sports chief says higher wages could hurt the expansion
Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The opponents of Prague apartment Marchmeloon rejoice.
The controversial building got a stopwatch.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
The building, which is to be built in the close vicinity of the Anezh Monastery in the centre of Prague, was protested by 1 hundred people before the Prague office, and petitions were also created.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that there was a breach of the building law, since all the features of the territorial decision were not respected.
“The territorial decision in question does not include, for example, the type of land, the distance from the neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and clearly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the influence of the building,” the decision states.
It is also considered to be an illegal magistrate that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation originally discussed, but it has changed.
For example, it is the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file material that, however, the owner of the land only confirmed the consent to the project documentation for territorial proceedings, not the consent to the location of the building on his land, writes the department of the construction order.
According to Francesc August Razett, an investor firm did not take note of the decision of the governing body - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
“We have been preparing this project for 17 years, respecting all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions involved,” Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marsmeloon because of the alleged color of the facade, creates strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city centre in the past in protest against the building.
The association and residents of nearby homes are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that should have looked different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Anezh monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdenek Fránek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted on the glass facade, was rejected on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPÚ) of the Ministry of Culture and cancelled in 2010 the permits of Prague monumentaries.
A new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces, but the NPÚ and the master’s monument have been approved and building permits have been issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects opponents, said he never counted on the facade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname after pink-white candy.
The Czech politician brought migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On his way, he took three Syrian refugees along with the crew in the car, who said they wanted to take about half a mile.
It was not criminal in Hungary at the time, he said.
We knew that the guardians of the law were not affected by such action.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and taken to an investigation in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in the cell.
The police said they were doing the right thing, but they did not know English very well.
The prison, however, was sober.
For example, in our cell about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were forced.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were closed there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg said.

Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi in South and West Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as the Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice creamer offering tastings in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investor strategy day.
There’s a lot at stake because South and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA’s trade moves and generates a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and West Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than those in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in Eastern countries.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will count on 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA’s retail could lose $360 million on annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the following year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash’s fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenue, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan’s latest survey found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Managing Manager of the Hamish Douglass Fund, founder of Magellan’s financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could probably disappear over the decades.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Douglasse last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18% to 14% since 2010 and income from Metcash food trade, which supplies about 1200 IGA retail outlets, fell by 43% since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculation change, as sales and returns are under pressure.
However, wholesale has switched to counter-attack and invests more than $150 million a year to match counter-attack prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week to help IGA retailers re-further their stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
Metcash, CEO Ian Morrice, says the pricing and transaction handling programs will catch down and hope that the wholesale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in a recent habit of his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, according to President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called the Special Ks, has drawn unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an aphery with the infamously known Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then said: “Wawrinka had to pull one to Kyrgios and I should have drawn it too.”
While he was last seen breaking the rocket after the turret stunned Richard Gasquet at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakise unwaveringly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for the second doubles against Bernard Romac in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
“I’ve been thinking very strongly about Thanasi being a little bit overwhelmed in the whole dispute,” Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of the turret in the US, but he's not the first player to blow his own anger on his rocket because of frustration, and I know Thanasi pretty well, and I can say he's not going to be proud of this event.
But he did very well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, working very hard and fits perfectly into the team and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, training hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and advanced young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of an important match that begins on Friday, and states that ‘mutual decision’ is the right solution for everyone, but supports a native from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term stand.
“First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that [Kyrgios] has formed around it,” Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public he is growing fast, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and for some time outside of the profession, when he will be able to think about it, he is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and for himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and holds migrants
Following the announcement of the threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the country no one, and Serbian authorities reacted outraged.
Those who have been stuck for an unknown time on the belts of the country between the two states are faced with those who flee violence in their native countries, build tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, migrants call together “Open the border” and broadcast the order unit of the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water.
Serbia’s foreign minister says it was “unacceptable” for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just an indirect injury.
During the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries,” says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Unrest at the Hungarian-Serb border came a day after a bloc of 28 states did not come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprised Italy and Greece and talked with hope of reaching a possible agreement another month or at the end of the year that EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary has not attached its hopes to Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's threat situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to address the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up the trial of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a fence of barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now finished.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to stretch barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are following a better life and not war refugees looking for protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new law, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, is now criminalizing violations of the 4 meter fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for longer periods in prison for those who illegally convert refugees.
“Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of threat,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are clear about this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters at the border observed a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s defense adviser, said the authorities had captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and had already caught 15 in the territory of the state.
They have penetrated through fence damage and are now charged with committing offences under new laws in police custody.
The authorities quickly fixed the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a semi-trailer covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Roszke there was chaos, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal processing container and created prints of people.
About 20 of them came in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's jump in front of Bernie Sanders reduced by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders takes her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce whether he wants to become president, has received support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that there are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton sponsors are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost ground under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton keeps a big lead between women and relieves, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men was significantly reduced, and Sanders only lost 5 points on her.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has been evaporated and now they're equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead in front of Sanders among liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only for being a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s not surprising that Clinton’s contemporaries are particularly passionate about her.
The views are mixed between those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of the Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked about why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the time to be president of a woman (13%), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a great possibility of choosing and agreeing on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidate for the president, 57 percent of the Democratic primary voters would like to see the leader face to face - a third of them think they should not run.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party nomination, Biden is the most common choice.
Clinton’s supporters included more than half of Biden’s as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for a Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in general elections; however, this number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see it as most likely to be elected increases.
However, when it comes to the question of the more important importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over greater chances of election.
Like last month, neither a democratic candidate nor a potential candidate shall act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads sincerely, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent don’t have that opinion.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological outlook.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as state secrets continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of it did not affect her at all.
But among the American public, this is a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public’s views on this topic were split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say that this email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of them have worsened their opinion of Clinton.
They are Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don’t think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were best held.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, many voters don’t think of him.
The gap between the 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Ends Donald Trump in National Elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll and others are seeking support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, and climb from 23% of the support in the last CBS poll conducted prior to the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and dissipates Trump among university-trained Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carla Fiorina and the Governor of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind, together with Wisconsin’s governor Scott Walker, completely on a footing with 10% of the support fell to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The gap between 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey released last week showed Carson improved and reached 19% of support among Republicans for Trump’s 32% support.
A recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post has also shown that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
In the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot blindly at the neurosurgeon on the service, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First Year Student Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overloading fraternal ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, she was charged with murder against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College of Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun-Michael-Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and later took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
The police said he had blinded his eyes, wearing a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about the headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Dog Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found time to change Dengo's dress, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the nationwide president of the brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, members began hiding equipment and basically prefering the well-being of brotherhood to the life of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He did not recover and died the next morning.
According to the drinking report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dull object in the head, trunk and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated as a result of the overload in fraternity, and at least one student dies every year due to overload since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, in a statement.
The fraternity and its members must be accountable and this step is important by the authorities.
Monroe County’s grand jury has recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assaulting overload and criminal association.
“We want to retain not only the persons involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also allow them to be held accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned fraternity and national fraternity has abolished its relationship with local branches.
This happens when the Fed raises interest rates
The growth of rates will come and the bull market will knock, the yields of bonds will rise and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy, in particular, the history of a small originer offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve system in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when they start raising rates, but rather on the trajectories of how long normalization will take.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the habits due to the increase in speed can be excessive.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, a global economist at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last about a month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a bit unstable.
But as soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for resumption of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed’s increase.
More specifically, the market in the last about 35 years often the most - about 14 percent - is heading to an increase in rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management’s main equity strategist, published at Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
A recession is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often help it.
At present, the Fed faces some conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
Most notable is that the gross domestic product near its lowest point in history when increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 increases in rates since 1950, the nominal year-on-year increase in GDP was only twice as low as 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky, and the question could arise: “Whether this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for Fed growth all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles have been in the super cycle of increasing leverage effect with GDP covering the peaks of the start of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those when the Fed was waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're 74 months and we're still going on.
The fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects an increase in rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes the direction of politics.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the cycle of increase/reduction.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Strategists Charles Schwab believe that an increase in rates will bring yields between long- and short-term bonds closer to the curve.
“High yield bonds often work better in this climate, even if we’re still careful about the yield tension,” according to a firm analysis by Katy Jones, a fixed pension analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapted to Fed's expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are above, the yield curve is more complex, the credit margin has expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens the policy.
In general, companies that do most of their business in the US will win after a rise in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational debt companies will do worse, as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
“History shows that “quality” of shares tends to overcome within three months of an initial increase in rates,” Goldman Sachsve said in a report.
Companies with strong balance sheets have overtaken weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital gains, as well as low volatility stocks, also exceeded their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent points), or 3 (percent points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a growing dollar.
Consumers can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticizes this station for being stupid.
He believes that he is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says he's just cheating on the British.
Damien Collins's fellow MP assaults the Voice and says neither he is an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is “changing” in the Classic FM, says a leading member and accumulates fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove they are doing something that commercial broadcasts don’t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that public service radio stations seem to be “supplied” and are increasingly indiscriminate from their business opponent.
\"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'noise' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM,\" he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market,\" Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC CEO has rejected allegations that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn’t learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually at the top level.
“I also think the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 wasn’t the only element of BBC production that got under fire because of the fact that it was playing on the heels of business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as Judge - was made - a way typical of the BBC -
He added that he wanted the Corporation to - find a hit from its own stable - when it starts the fun series next time.
However, he refused to exclude orders for more future series of The Voice or spending money on other formats of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be guilty.
First three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the records began in 2000.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for stopping spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and thanks to it, it has become a city of ghosts from many British main streets.
However, experts say there are signs of online sales becoming stable, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August was the lowest increase in growth since the very beginnings of the measurement of 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales becoming stable, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth in recent years and go back to 2000, the condition has always been rationalized over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, IMRG’s sales index editor.
He explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago, when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) seems somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to resonate.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and throw down several sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers re-contract, can hold customers from further purchases
A research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was lost online.
For some products, such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of a crane in Mecca, and Bin Laden's family was sanctioned
The body of 29 dead was transmitted by the streets of Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly guilty of the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group construction magnate.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of a crane in Grand Mosque, Mecca.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose their way and gave respect to the victims when the first of the fallen got on their last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and turned to the believers.
The body was released for the funeral, and the Saudi king was sanctioning the building group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which was also abandoned by 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of a crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children of Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before starting the annual pilgrimage of the snake.
Saudi officials have already promised that the snake will take place in Mecca and thousands of people will continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the crane’s shoulder up when it wasn’t in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried out by the state operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of falling.
The English Disk Agency did not report this detail, but said the company’s bosses had been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were converging before the Haj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane and did not make any comments to its representatives.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi-Arab ruling families for decades and run large construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda Osama bin Laden was the son of a fallen man, whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident happened in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before millions of people in the kingdom arrived on a pilgrimage, which must be attended by every capable Muslim at least once in her life.
According to officials, 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be given to relatives killed and the same amount for permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q chief says Eastern European traders are working cheaply no longer trending

The British say they delay hammers and brushes and hand them over to the educated East European craftsmen to work with them at home.
If you do it with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do their Kutilian work at home, according to the head of the company for the Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, Kingfisher’s new CEO, who owns a chain for domestic needs, says a large increase in the number of learned traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
Today, most men are male workers.
She said there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more female households, which are making more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, “Most of the men work in our shops.
We need to get close to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of decisions about buying goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laura, who is one of only five women at the headquarters of the leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that he has half the representation of women among employees, including executive and financial director.
Mrs. Laura says: 'It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced a decline in profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing trades.
The result of Kingfisher’s trend, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores.
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is at risk.
“It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice,” said Vice-President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
The president of ODS Zbynek Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but it would be better for the long term to be in standard valorization because it would be reflected in the years to come.
“We have space to find a mechanism to do this,” Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marx (ČSSD), according to which he was to valorize beyond the law next year.
Marx advocated a subsidy saying it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she believes is not pink.
The higher valorization next year would mean the budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are discussing every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorization decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
In December, the right-wing paycheck makes it difficult and perhaps impossible, he said.
As a result, ČSSD MP Roman Sklenák proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the norm in the committee for ten or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
However, the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is to be used in particular.
In the coming year, pensions should increase by an average of about a century.
According to the pension amendment, people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December should receive the contribution.
It could also be obtained by those who died in December entitled to a pension before its payment.
However, they would have to apply in writing at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valorizing regularly as of January, up prices and a third of the real wage growth.
This year's salary is 41.5 percent gross, and next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion a year more.
The expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26% of all budget expenditure and 46% of all expenditure required under the law.
The average full old age pension last year increased to CZK 10,714 according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a payoff of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has left his plans for a political career, he will be engaged in science.
The Senate chair was almost certain according to Russian media.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the region of Kaliningrad, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the governmental party Unified Russia, defended his post in the Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but elected by the governor from three candidates whose names will be announced before the governorial elections.
After the election, the senator from three candidates chooses himself.
The complication was for Jakunin that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin, he is an extraordinary and authorised ambassador who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
He finished filming Czech comedy The Tiger Theory.
The last drop in the resolution of the main hero is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who had lost strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that she and her wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain his government over his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the previous one, said Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in a comedy form, in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the lead role would happen to Bartošek, with whom he had already worked on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with the recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We've negotiated with each other three years ago.
I gave him a reading of the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was probably an athlete.
He had always wondered where he was going to sit before filming another scene.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing rocks and even walking up a hill.
And all this in record tropical buckets, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoska, women take tigers to turn them into rabbits over time.
They'll put some food on him, but they'll close the door just so he doesn't think of playing a tiger outside the rabbit room.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor said.
His wife, who can act slightly negatively on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
It is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, said Bajgar.
The film simultaneously depicts the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavel Beretová - and the children of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has promised to provide more than $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is a charitable branch of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Telicek's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech MEP for the YES movement Pavel Telička postponed his planned Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled his official visit today.
Baku, according to Telička, justifies the EP resolution last week that criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička co-authored.
By decision of the Azerbaijan party Telička lost the opportunity to interview official partners and visit political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in a press release of his Brussels office.
The trip, planned several months in advance, was to be used by Telička to meet with Parliament and executive representatives and representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the ČTK said.
MEP resolution condemns “unseen repression against civil society in Azerbaijan”
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent judgment on Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Khadija Ismailova, who advocated the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it will build its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out that a Russian air base would be established in Syria in the future.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has already had a naval base in Syria in Tartus, which has been used as a service and logistics centre so far.
However, Russian press reports have increased since the beginning of August the supply of Russian equipment and military material to Syria.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base near Latakiya, which for the time being remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
Washington, however, is not quite clear about the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria, American commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will head to Moscow to interpret concerns about gathering a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow’s support of Assad a lost bet.
Russia’s policy objectives in Syria are rather unclear.
Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation of the Russian press, is to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the situation in Donbass in Ukraine is not intended to be discussed by the Russian leader.
According to a report by The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during the U.N. session.
However, the views between White House advisers are still falling apart.
TASS today, citing the words of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet had a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York stay.
Put on sesame oil during the gallbladder diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from cold seeds, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, the Czech Republic has been the most common cause of death for several years.
Stomach inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pan, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used for heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in a gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are good prevention of bile stones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, bile problems affect especially overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that this oil brings, they should pay attention to goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use over-roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
The oil, however, loses all its active ingredients, was described by Ladislav Dojecký, Executive Director from the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces bio virgin oils pressed cold.
The company also newly produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can press 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin marking.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits from diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among the oils is sunflower.
Research by Jarmila Hamerská, who led the University of Masaryk, found that 43% of respondents preferred him in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 °C it begins to burn.
It is better to use it, for example, to taste salads and it is especially suitable in a diet in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most of all fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels.
With heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of total fat and calories you receive.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to note that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than empty calories.
They are part of industrialized products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last just like the sesame and hemp nine months.
Storage in the refrigerator extends the shelf life.
Old oil people know especially the bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no constipation on the bottom.
It is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical cannabis seeds are called superfoods, and hemp oil is considered the healthiest of plant oils.
This label owes to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of researchers published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while the Icelandics take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of the cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil found its way to consumers confirms the fact that in Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling.
It is sold 500 liters a year.
People often use one tablespoon fasting after the morning.
Hemp oil is not tastefully pronounced, but it will improve immunity, advised Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, the nation's most famous grillers are Americans.
One home has 1.4 grills.
All over the world, there are various barbecue competitions that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not shared their lives.
The vast majority then grilled several times a year.
To make grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time leaves the health of the beneficial substances while grilling?
In general, during the grilling process itself should be saved with fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of beneficial substances, which are otherwise obtained when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, the experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately equip the grape oil.
It is a wonderful addition to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils, he retains the health of beneficial substances, describing the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example in the seasoning of salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
Thus, grilling can be used in two ways, marinating and grilling itself.
By eating the meat and fish, we will preserve their juiciness.
In the preparation of the marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we provide acidity with apple vinegar and thus achieve softening of meat.
The spices again add a lot of taste and the oil preserves and supplies the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
Therefore, marinated meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare meals.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This is particularly true of linseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grate with oil, preventing the burning of food.
The necessary part of the barbecue is also the preparation of attachments.
Almost anything is suitable for grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, a salad of hot summer.
To it you need: - 1 piece of peach - 1 bunch of rucola - 1 cup of chopped cucumber - 1 cup of salad leaves - 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In a salad bowl, add to the mixture of salad leaves a broken ruffle, chopped cucumbers and large cubes chopped with peaches.
To taste salt and pepper, you can also taste with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, chop a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, then you can sprinkle the salad with finely cut almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it does not matter only on medication, but also on the patient’s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, such as women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they choose to have a child, social counselling, housing recommendations, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient himself.
The more he actively struggles with the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As the doctors point out, the passiveness of the sick frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is shown that regular movement greatly delays the time when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why the site Take a chance (www.bezmytu.cz) is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of a person with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of multiple sclerosis, there is a double saying that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage where the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we hit, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or imbalance of the balance.
The patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen pelvic floor, relieve bleeding disorders or improve coordination.
“It’s truly individual, it depends on the patient’s specific difficulties,” says Martin Kövári, primary director of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it is manifested in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
Movement activity, however, also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive feature of regular exercise is the fact that the sick are checking what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
“In the exercise, endorphins are also flowing out and one feels good about it,” says PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine, Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
“These patients have been treated so-called, today we know they need a targeted burden,” says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, a priority of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is that one can remain self-sufficient as long as possible, including working inclusion.
Therefore, physiotherapists work with ergotherapists to give each person a compensation tool tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a painful soul we are to go after someone, not to try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
“I work with them to finally conclude that even with the handicap one can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life,” says psychotherapist Renata Malinová, Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can be produced and processed by someone.
However, next to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for forming composites, you can encounter something as common as apricot furnaces.
In a drum that resembles a pot on a sugar wool, in a pile of furnaces, the edges of metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are passed away.
“No one has found anything better yet,” smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the aviation door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the complex in Prague Letňany, the former Letov produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which are assembled in Prague, also enter the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There is also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
For example, the moment keys let the company manage twice a year.
If the yellow label lacks a check record, they should explain what the auditors from Airbus or Boeing should do at the Prague plant, who go regularly to see if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
However, human senses have not yet completely replaced advanced technology.
There are 1,500 rites on one door to A320.
You've got to break up by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the hammer, they will know if it is already properly broken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
It can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetre.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
During the check, a lot of trained touch comes to mind.
When the controller goes through a number of rivets, he knows if one is out of tolerance.
Then he'll take the exact glider in his hand.
Before 1989, he had a program of training military aircraft L-39.
In 1991, none of them were produced.
The company had to quickly find new orders.
At that time, she joined the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the emergency door supplier for the A321.
The talks with Boeing were not so happy.
“We were a small company that didn’t have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable deliveries,” Dubsky said.
The door to the American manufacturer would have been forgotten if Letov had not taken part in the 1999 Prague conference of the international aviation industry association of the French group Latecoere.
I was talking about our partnership with Airbus.
The next day the negotiations with the French started, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
The assembly of parts of the door for the A320 began immediately in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck door for the A380 was added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for Boeing Dreamliner vans.
Without Latecoere, we would not get to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
Partners want a guarantee of delivery for 20 or 30 years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after the tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any doors for aircraft.
Receive certificates that production processes meet the requirements of customers, and keep them in repeated checks worth millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to train employees, equip the equipment and re-certify the entire process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is completing the preparation of a process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the previously harmful Cadmium for human health.
Although they were given by the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they used in Prague.
People from Boeing will come and examine the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab.
One set of samples will be tested on their own in their laboratory, and then the results will be compared with ours, bringing the Dublin way customers control them.
The rewards of the Prague company are long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant stands today and the production of embryos falls.
For A320, half of the total door volume is produced.
To replace the Czech Latecoere is impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that he can say any price at the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It shows how much one door will cost ten, fifty, hundreds of made pieces.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we'll make money, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M are set up, is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen is a new semi-robot line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovative A320 Neo.
The riveting speeds up and refines.
“This is the trend that the assembly in aviation is taking place,” adds Dubský.
The sale has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3278 units of the new A320.
Just a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start within two years, says Dubský.
However, before that, the company has to pass the qualification tests, for example, to mount some electrical and electronic devices into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also focuses on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
“It’s a huge credit for the company when it can process compositions in addition to metal materials,” says Dubský.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more space in the area of Letov, where it is located.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
He now has 800, and within three years there could be more than a hundred.
As long as Airbus and Boeing overtake how many hundreds of new aircraft are ordered each year, they don’t have to worry about the job.
Although she has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of the Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan payments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she exchanged some of the loans for shares.
Creditors gained a share of 37.4 percent in the company by increasing capital by €57.4 million.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, which is 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has signed a new stock for €222.9 million among existing shareholders.
In total, it raised core capital by 280 million euros.
At the same time, the whole group benefits from growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which accounts for 85 percent of sales.
The average growth of contracts is expected to be 4% per year until 2017.
In the order book, it has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four-year production.
French media say that Latecoere can finally re-inhale after years on drops.
The Czech race in the Letňany in Prague is important for the groups.
16% of the group’s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported a greater share of the state's coal fees.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
The revenue of municipal budgets is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, as the fee is to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipalities received around CZK 450 million and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
About 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were mined from coal mining.
The amendment also includes an increase in the payoff from the conquering areas with allowed mining for a thousand crowns per hectares per year.
The income from these payments shall continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that the village will gain 14 million to 100 million crowns a year.
The amount of the mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The payment shall be recalculated as the sum of the amount of mineral mined and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government regulation might not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Young, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral that is the state's property.
Fees shall be granted only to municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the city’s money and a quarter of the state’s money will be mined.
The same ratio will be the case in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the State collects on the fees of mining will be purposefully bound.
For example, 28% will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The bill was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would damage the communities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and the Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they would pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
“It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget,” said David Kadner, who was elected in the U.S. region.
Hana Aulický, a member of the KSČM, warned of the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulický had proposed to reject the amendment unsuccessfully, and Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work on it.
According to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent of the long-term contract.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heating plants, should therefore not feel the price rise.
“But on the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees,” the government admits.
However, the increase in employment charges is a bearable one.
According to the rapporteur for Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for both the state and the village, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall only after 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the U.S. Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision as to whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event because it has been down for years since the Fed reduced rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The U.S. economy did quite well, recovering in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances indicate that they also see a great chance against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Gunner at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday, and later that day and his colleague, wrote a message claiming to be “forewarn” to him of the first murder, and that he wanted him to take it back, the government authorities revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social science at Delta State University, called police on Monday morning around 10 o'clock.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb the dispatcher asked him to send police officers to his house.
He said: \"I shot my wife last night - and he also mentioned that there is a \"comfortable dog\" in the house - who \"will not bother anyone - but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb didn't explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, Amy Prentiss found the body of 41-year-old and handwritten message from Lamb, in which it stood: “I am very sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me.
After leaving the message, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed the history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The Dean of the University William LaForge said he didn’t know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb’s head.”
Despite Monday’s statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss’ romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was “no evidence” of a love triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was \"a great person.\"
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was “shocked” by the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were \"best friends\"
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, according to Sun Herald, worked Prentiss from home over the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named \"Catch,\" was dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help others,” she said.
The police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to prison.
When the police caught him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he shot himself.
According to a CV published on the school’s website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett in 2009 due to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these things will be taxed.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right foot during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-wing defender left this injury in tears and kicked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injury caused by the careless intervention of Héctor Moren in 15 minutes, when 20-year-old Shaw entered the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has suffered a double leg fracture and now he’s in the hospital.”
It will be transported tomorrow or maybe after tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has a very hard time, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing rooms, he also had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I hope he will play this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli of Mexico has not been punished.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure for both legs.
Tweet from Shaw’s account says: “Thank you to everyone for their messages, words can’t be expressed as I’m destroyed, my way to recovery begins now and I’ll come back even stronger.”
Manchester United reported injury to Luke Shaw in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It was a very ugly injury.”
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered from a foot fracture in the fight for Mexico against Van Gaal’s Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such a injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I was unable to see this moment.
I only saw the ball that was heading in a different direction, so it seemed like it [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see Luke's intervention.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's intervention.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long for him to learn to remember it.
You must not be David Cameron.
When asked by a child scheme provider to name his favorite children's book, he chose Prime Minister Lorax, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seusse.
It was hard to choose from, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: “A funny, touching, creative and with strong content, I liked reading this to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had never seen before.”
All right, except in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of a 2012 film elevator that added more characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
“In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of your dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree, is a brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it weren’t enough suspect, the text delivered by Cameron reads as a summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: “In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl’s dreams, Audrey.”
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely Cameron would get acquainted with the story of a book where an untitled young man learns that the local nature is devastated by a raven, tree-moving industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a twisted, moustified creature who “speaks behind the trees”
Most likely, such a relatively small PR task was given to a helper who had never read to a Lorax child 20 times in a piece.
The Downing Street spokesperson said the text probably came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was at risk of forgetting England, but still holds
Competeing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team that England chose on this tour, I think it will be unlikely to repeat the defeat of 3-0, which she suffered last time in the trial series.
I would also not exclude guests from winning either.
The Alastair Cooka side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this battling lineup and also collective thinking is strong; they will not bear scars from 2012, only youthful positives.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an attacking possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth fell out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a hard nut for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that the players of the scream are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root there were no questions, which led to the announcement, because - and I have already mentioned this - the players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centurys and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own fate.
Let's hope that if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not 100%, and that does not surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the batter gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven pins - like Sam Robson in front of him - while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could do is to give England a chance in the Caribbean to Jonathan Trott - even though Lyth was in the best form - but this wasted opportunity is already a past.
Alex Hales comes and that's a batter I'm very positive about.
He's the x-factory Cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall assembly in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of when Moeen begins alongside Cook, who would have won another extra spinner while he would have preserved four quicks, has been lifted and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing screamer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and there is no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 exams before his performance in 2001.
They immediately succeeded in three centuries and did not even look at it.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was impressed as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and I see it as a prami, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors decided for the youth.
He learns a lot about this tour.
In addition, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a battling officer from Sri Lanka, as a test match consultant can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the White-ball tour and brings both energy and merciless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cry, whether as a player or coach, and just as Mahela has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes ease and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's co-worker Ben Berkeleys was given one day off, as well as Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, trainers and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you need to remember, as a player, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron’s unintended strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets into other problems with every last day and without choosing a genius Jeremy, “It’s Yes or No, Corbyn to the head of the Workers’ Party,” or TUC takes the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is sinking in a variety of crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, divisional concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided they didn’t want to do it even if they did not want social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo before the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
“My European friend, who wants to see Britain unnoticed in Europe - ‘Don’t leave us alone with France,’ says Berlin, suggesting that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don’t care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German prudent chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes bad for her, as it has been for too long for the continuing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
France François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how they break their feet with the help of Selfie Britons who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they themselves do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan intentionally useless notes of the SNP style during the 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
The problem has been solved - and 'Britain has nothing worth negotiating' -
Europeans know for themselves how predatory Fleet Street can be, and how sceptical the press oligarchs are to the EU, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benne in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, a pop-up Euro-portunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur, the EU straight banana, in the early 1990s.
Despite his fury, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of non-tax payers, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo-Ocean departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a crazy gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so that you don't have to have dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of abrogated EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a ban card.
The press has never forgiven him either.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who, on Monday in Westminster, was friendly about me - I told him that he should not waste any more time on me - it seems to be in danger of re-accepting the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC left on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I'll say, kind, evolving.
He said he wanted to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people out of the turbulent tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly come to it.
Hilary said the same thing, “Bemm, but not Benniite,” Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner Scout could not agree to admit that Corbyn’s appointment as an abrasive McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his grandfather fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to stay - under all circumstances - Bennin's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, or what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to tell - don't forget, he touched me - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television, and especially in the faith, parity of paranoia and betrayals that are social media.
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign as obvious, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbyn's basic twisting about EU membership - in line with their Bennite besieged economy, an anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic hashing.
As with his twisting about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British-weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of the conservative government in power, as I have been reminded of the Monday launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticize electronic review published by Public Health England
A government-funded statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet’s criticism of the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a report last month describing it as a “complex review of evidence”
However, several researchers questioned the breadth of data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, an introduction to the professional journal Lancet attacked a “extremely chatty base” on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have questioned the claims that were allegedly “built on a rock or sand”
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They report that the public could expect the statement by PHE, which reads “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking,” based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to develop an analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) model's decision to synthesize its views on damage associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO previously acquired funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved BAT’s public health mandate in the sustainability report, it says.
One of the 12 participants granted funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not funding that was previously obtained from Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known electronic cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial financing in newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by the tobacco leadership.
The report in this group “excussionally admits,” the missing “hard evidence of the harm to most products on most criteria,” said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokings,” they said.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ claim had been answered earlier.
“Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
One in two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what they do not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die from smoking-related diseases every year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By emphasizing the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competences.
BBC to end with EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would be right-handed for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that will likely only track a handful of people in complex broadcasting times compared to its rivals - the biggest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After Tony Hall’s CEO said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
“I struggle with the idea that the BBC is entering and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast without state contributions,” Johnson said in a Communication Commission in the House of Commons, as part of the debate on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain licensing fees that I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, at least the creation of programs that are not produced or supplied by others should be reduced.
They broadcast The Voice at the main broadcast time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send it out is a ridiculous joke, and of course absurd.
Johnson said, “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded unsolicitedly.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and, of course, produced on domestic soil.
In fact, other channels would give them a right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at least.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty of catching ratings because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support.
His commentary on the most popular BBC shows repeats those that former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC would sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more entrenched public service programs are going to the BBC4, where quite often audiences cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their powers and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn of royalties income, “But of course we are doing all these obscene programs that no one is looking at.”
They are being broadcast at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the licensing fee, Johnson told the Commission: “I urge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who spoke before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reich’s mission in the sense of informing, educating and entertaining.
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production had been previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a model public broadcast in Australia and Canada and change to - inform, clarify and entertain -
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast only a handful on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
Sonogenetics - or brain cell control by means of sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the hens move.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small helicopters change the direction when they are affected by sound impulses that are inaccessible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Can Read and Write Brain Activity With Light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are prepared into the patient's brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Hlutens usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when it places them in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channels of the TRP-4, located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, is reported in a report by Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When he used ultrasound on the worms so modified, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to worms, where they turned on modified motor neurons.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, let himself be heard that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissues without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that his use would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

Advertising British arms trade.
Watch the video of Amnesty International’s anti-gun market.
Horrible killer drones!
The legs that break the ankles!
Banging missiles!
And electric stunning shoes that cause intolerable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world’s largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International due to the fact that the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the emergence of posters at bus stops and meters, which require a second look.

According to Calvin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and expert assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists within the protest movement and realize that they must get out in the real world to make their art impact on society.

Creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silently encircling advertising about the arms trade - he saw an empty place in the ExCel calendar - and thought, \"Let's show them a campaign to avoid -
They played with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but \"adding colorful colors and animations, I've achieved that it attracts more people -
“They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair,” says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture facilities are not illegally traded on our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to the college as an unnoticed nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in barrets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I was mindful of - and numerous, lengthy complaints to others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the track can range from slightly to nerves going to total shock.
It’s appealing to murmur: tell people where you are, if you took a year off, what opinion you have about Corbyn, and why, “You honestly don’t love or hate Marmite just because people, it’s just an extract from the Hahaha yeast, I’ll be in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and those you wouldn't even have fun with if your eyelashes were in one fire, and they'd be issuing fire extinguishers.
Let people have space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, film evenings and municipal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.

Introverts at high will come in short.
Your room should be a refuge, yet many tracks turn into an extra-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, ‘I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can go back to the energy I needed to talk to you.’
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him instead of a knock.
When it comes to tapping, tap.
One boy in my tracks was used to saying that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Since you started going to the university at the top of the baking mania, tapping on a foreign door and showing with a slice of baked cakes seems slightly less strange, less than 'Welcome to the neighborhood, I've made something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions -
Offering home food is a good way to make friends.
Your kids will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end by assigning your face to a delicious surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a deserving bakery.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and stiff are likely to disrupt that others will kiss sleep when you try to knock them on the door.
Food theft is a common crime on the student's tracks.
Stealing the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is there a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double check with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're stuck inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my grandfather, who exchanged her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in prison now.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a deserving human being, but you’re also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could make the drum and bass a little quiet because they were 3 at night and in the morning she had a pen.
Their answer was to amplify music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she left them to sleep for two hours and then released her own music out loud, locked the door and left for her three-hour letter.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future goes on the same track as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be embarrassing if you were to confuse your kids for your future, sleep together, break up and have to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you won't recommend your heart - but if your sexy dick is 100% not your future, try to talk to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
At an elevating moment, when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin border between the legging and the bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put them in a bottle of water, which you then stick into the freezer - but never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva experienced a fragile moment during her pregnancy with a seven-year-old Vitka.
His father broke up with her and she was alone in preparing and raising her offspring.
I had to deal with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the child and I was looking for a positive one.
Uncertainty and by being alone with a child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not stay alone for a long time, she remembers her first pregnancy today.
She already met on the Internet at the cottage of the older Vaška, with whom she began to talk about favorite films.
Vasek Eva and Vitek even brought home from the obstetrics, but he did not fall into the role of stepfather.
“For some time, he withdrew from the show,” Eva said in a documentary series Four in that 3.
The theme of the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness for the second attempt.
She was able to take care of the Vitka and the financial security of the family thanks to her part-time work and the great help of the mother and the help of the aunt.
Even the prospects for responsibility for a foreign child eventually did not spoil Vaška’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around the Second Birthday of Vit's, and he now understands Vaška as his father and also addresses him so much.
Although yours already has two adult daughters, she enjoys fatherhood in sixty words, and she also devotes more to children.
In addition to Vitka, there was a two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually a twins.
“Your family entered our family naturally, perhaps even because my mother never spoke much to me,” she smiles.
Few places?
At least we're close.
The twins Ema and Ela were born in the imperial section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and operation of bile acids, which then occur in excess amounts in the blood of pregnancy and are manifested in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, most of the time self-consumption of the mother after childbirth.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vaška, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emika was placed in the incubator in the intermediary department, where Vaškova’s niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from JIP to the room I had her with me, describing the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent 20 days in the obstetrics until doctors approved the release of babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting for children to be taken in Eve’s obstetrics did not make them happy.
“I was crazy about my husband and children,” a four-time mother remembers the hard moments in the six-day department.
She also considered signing the reverse with her husband, including due to the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this was not the case, and doctors released Eva and his twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancys and births broadcast on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large number of families can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to get enough with an electric two-plane and tight conditions.
Although the house was not enlarged, Vasek made Eve’s joy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If it's hot, we're going to take a taxi.
Eva is convinced that children especially perceive family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or mass of the house.
So far, we've folded up a lot better than we've expected.
Although the mess is worse hidden in a small space and we sometimes cross the baby, but at least we’re all close, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side for every situation.
The work of the illuminator in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That is why he sometimes goes to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages, but how long will it be?
“I am aware that given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family,” Eva admits to the plane when asking for the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
I am not currently with four children for employers.
And if it's worse, my husband and I can take a taxi, he's kidding a blonde.
Apple affected the yes effect.
The displays are responsible for everything.
A more powerful processor, a higher resolution camera, a stronger chassis, or a touch power-recognizant display, which is briefly the advantages of the recently introduced 9th-generation iPhones.
The last two have also had a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s trend so far was that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous generation.
The exceptions were only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in the disadvantage of the news was truly negligible.
This is not the case with new iPhones.
Compared to the iPhones 6 and 6 Plus last year, the weight increased by 14 grams in the smaller model, with 20 grams in the larger one.
On the one hand, it’s not surprising that Apple’s last year’s bending affair has been greatly affected by Apple’s pockets.
The chassis is thus made of more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected on the weight.
But the display has a much greater impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology to recognize the power of touch.
For this, it was necessary to provide the display with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhone displays has increased more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult to use component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved thanks to the defatting cortex, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, the most difficult to use battery element, however, its weight has not changed in any way compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the largest increase is evident in the display.
The weight of 5.5- iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As long as the new display technology is practical, it will only manifest itself when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday 25th September, when sales of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Is the breakfast of the champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists succeeded in finding which opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered here traces of settlements by a modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remains of tools and so on and so on.
In layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that very resembles the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oatmeal grains were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of making today's popular petals.
With it, the grains are first soaked, then dried, rid of the packaging, the so-called rind, then burned and sprayed flat.
In the Paglicci cave, grains, which seem to have been heated or burned, were discovered, and then probably crushed between two millstones - at least this suggests traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists were unable to prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that there would be a complete process in the cave of the production offlakes, but the similarity is indeed very noticeable.
We also don’t have any evidence of how people could eat theflakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and perhaps even warm, of course, is offered completely logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agriculture was created.
If the fencing interpretation is correct, the oldestflakes preceded agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New reports of stations in the Transport Enterprise of the City of Brno.
So, once again, I listened to the reports of the stop names in the trolleybus: Hnusáčekva, Miracle, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was slightly louder, so the report with a male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops reported with a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so the deeper noise of traffic is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this speaker was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly picked it from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different than in the frame of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a couple of decades, so the right names for all those stops I know of memory, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't know each other and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can be at the end where they accidentally went, then claim that the stop they were supposed to make was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the speaker - but better again the speaker - should be done again, and this time undercoloured by the common traffic noise and the rack of the engine, in which the Speaker's edging on the bus is almost lost.
So that we do not have to listen to the names of the stations of Water Herspice, Šmírov, or then the Submersible in the quivering sage, which I moved to in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't suddenly get so bad during that one day when the speaker of the stops changed.
I understood the report quite well before that day.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the track record.
Today, few people already know what the biggest and the most intelligent were the so-called complex verifications.
I allowed myself to remember that.
The bus was late.
I came to the dispatcher's office when the radio said it was just seven hours.
“You’re lucky you didn’t meet your fellow chief, he came a minute ahead of you, and he doesn’t seem in the mood,” said the dispatcher while I was writing in the book of arrival.
Thanks, I'll take care.
You're telling me I'm driving around the neighborhoods on a small mechanization revision.
It's not going to happen, it's a test today.
They're all scared of it.
What's going on?
“You’ll see,” said the dispatcher.
Next time you'll be.
I ran to the corridor.
Then the door of the chief's house opened, and the chief appeared.
Caught, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling uniform.
“Good morning, Chief,” I greeted him respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of a jacket of the same size.
“Good morning,” the answer was, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone that the old one responded to.
“You’re playing,” said engineer Eva, an old lady who I valued.
He said he was even the chief before the comrades took her down.
There's a verification, and you're coming like that.
How many times have I asked what these complex reviews are, but no one wants to talk about it much.
They say they are once every three years, they all have to be with them, and it's pretty annoying.
At least for some.
I think I'll see.
I pulled out of the shell with periodic reports and then the phone.
“Here’s Holcman, come to me right now,” the chief said.
What bothers you?
Now we have met and nothing - I mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone just with their thoughts.
“Good morning, my fellow chief, I came to your order,” I grinned, barely entering the chief office.
The chief sat behind the desk and looked at some manager.
“A fellow mechanizer,” he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully looking at the leyster, “I don’t like your behavior at all.”
He threw the pole on the table, leaned into the back of the chair, and looked at me with the usual, unpleasant, evil, pictogramic look.
I did.
What's going on?
Even yesterday, the deputy praised himself that in the last few months I worked very well and that he was happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the reading at the distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I’ve been using such a greeting since I was a child, that I’ve been so raised and that I don’t see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red cloth for a turkey.
“You’re on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work,” the head of staff said.
Plus, you're still wrong about the superiors.
One time you say, \"Lord,\" and another time again, \"to the comrade.\"
But I'm not a chief of state for you, but a commander-in-chief.
Subsistents are comrades, the chief trackmasters are comrades of the upper trackmasters!
Please remember that!
I'm sorry, sir... my fellow chief, but... but I've greeted you with a regular civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work, or the comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
“It’s not your preference that you’re not on the side,” the chief spoke coldly, who in the meantime calmed down a little.
But there will still be talk about it.
Remember, you don't have a prepaid retirement chair up here.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his preference, it didn't look good on the subject.
For a while, he woke me up with a cold, pictogramic look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also impressed by his increased touch.
He was only a few years older and played panaboh, actually a comrade.
He's a rabid, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, as he's been doing right now.
He's all fucked up.
He's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-partisan, has clung to him.
But the chief touched many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
Right now, he hit me for a fucking shit.
I thought about the ass and it cost me enough to overdo it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to the crotch anymore, let alone a railway officer.
What would I use two kids for?
And a built-up house!
I was in the river, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
“That’s all, you can go,” the chief’s audience ended, and he began to look back carefully at the leyster he had previously in his hand.
They called me in the middle of the 12th.
Everyone from the office was already there and asking questions about what and how, they answered that, yes, it would be good.
Only Jozef bitusly spoke, as was his custom, that they could not throw us all out, because the work would have to be done by a comrade chief himself with his faithful, and that he did not threaten.
The word “compassionate” was as if he knew what the old man had shot me for in the morning.
There was a nice meeting at the front office.
A fellow chief behind his desk and at a long counselling table another comrades who were supposed to decide on my official being or not to be.
Kádrovák, president of the ROH, a staff writer, a special-purpose referent, something in the way of counter-traffics at war, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him out of the box.
An ordinary track worker, conquered the frets or forks, threw gravel.
But also a former narrator.
It was said that there was no fun with him at the time, he said, a nice beast.
The bad languages claimed that the school went out in the seventh grade, did not learn anything, did not know anything.
And when the crime was cancelled, he ended up on the crotch.
But comrade, yeah, the comrade was forged!
The chief instructed me to sit down.
There was a little soul in my neck, an unsociable neck.
Kádrovák read the opinion from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two children and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I've thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a judge from the party’s street organization.
He copied the opinion from the civil committee, perhaps both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of the longtime party members refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently left the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me very closely.
The man noticed and stopped reading.
The chief instructed him to continue.
It was only worse.
I was a member of the city committee of SSM and there I was won as a candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I also had a wedding in the church except for the National Committee.
I have failed the trust of the party in the worst way.
That's why I've been removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I went to a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When he read, only tapping the chief's pencil into the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
They all looked at me hard and I wanted me to be far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind the “communists, superhumans, communists, superhumans,” what did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix the switches without some fucking verification.
But now?
Her career as a railway official was taken as hers before she started.
Go back to the desk?
I don't think that's going to happen, the chief's going to take me for an hour.
“The comrade, in the way you have examined the comrade here, has interrupted the tense silence of the chief of the question on the cadre.
Well, according to the previous job assessment.
You got him here?
I don't think Kadrovka was overweight.
On the slopes of the sweat, he nervously mutilated, as if he himself had been tested.
He nodded and handed some paper to the chief.
“Well,” said the chief with a sign of gullibility, which was often the foreword of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with a distinction, studied an industrial school, worked in a task pay as a locksmith, and fulfilled the norm on average at 100 percent.
But it's a big one.
From where you took the judgment, comrade, he turned again to the chauffeur, who felt that it was beginning to turn against him, and that he might not be a chauffeur very soon.
This is where the comrade gave it to me when I got here.
Is that enough for you?
“Well, when he came to us, he went to the area to the table,” he said.
And there is no need for judgment, and he was a little extra, so I put him in the file.
“So when you were included in the technical function, you had enough of this paper,” the chief said.
The carcass was nervously mutilated and had no answer.
“No matter what, we’ll discuss it later,” the chief closed the case and apparently was relieved.
He stopped it for now.
“As with you, comrade, the chief turned again to me.
Suddenly I'm out, that's the end!
My eyes were dark, and I was so hot.
There followed a wave of regret and accusations, and I knew that I was the most repulsive creature in the world that did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That, by placing an incomplete assessment, I made the mistake of a fellow cadre referent, and I did not understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from a cadress in a factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, at the time of building real socialism, supports religious darkness, and even participates in them.
That, that, that, was a lot of what I did, or maybe I would still commit and silently prayed that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I could get out of the mechanizer's place.
I didn't care if I was taken by the dealer.
This is a work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of my fellow chief.
“So that would be enough, my fellow chief,” the party’s chairman said suddenly, and the leader’s left-wing.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he did!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade chief!
What could be worse for a young man than closing his door to the side for a while!
In order to open it again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is again worthy of our trust.
An uneducated narrator spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so sumptuous, or did he have a phrase from the party trainings and meetings?
That's why this young comrade also has to get a chance from us!
The chance to prove that it has changed.
And who should give it to him, if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, the somewhat mistaken comrade, in his efforts to correct him!
It's your partisan duty that no one can take away from you!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us too.
Here the comrade must see that the party did not forget him.
As a kind mother, he not only punishes, but also loves.
When the president finished, no one heard.
No one expected such a turn of situation.
At least me.
“I totally agree with you, my fellow president,” the chief led the ice to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me talk to you, you'd hear that I've just come to that conclusion.
They were all in agreement with their heads, but it was on them that they did not believe in a word.
“So I was confirmed for the function of a separate care referent for the basic means,” I shrugged back at the office and cried.
Except for the engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
The silence listened to my incoherent depiction of fresh experiences, and I was still calming down.
When I was done, she asked if I would have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the cookbook and prepared the pots.
In the meantime, she talked about cadavers practices.
Like one judgment, often full of praise, they put a man in their hands, and the other, in which there is dirt, they send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had it, but on the crotch at the crotch, so the co-workers from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our carpentry?
He doesn't care where he eats or drinks, so it finally turns out how it went.
“He’s got it from the old man,” she said.
I'm sure he won't taste it today.
Look out for him anyway, he's pretty vengeful.
And the party president?
In fact, a much worse chief, no people.
Zero from a crouper with great power.
The water for coffee began to boil, and at once the office filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in the pot and mixed a hot read.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
They won't fire me now, and there'll be more reviews in three years.
Anyway, my fellow chief won't forget me that day.
It came out in the anthology of the Literate at the loss of II. in the publishing house of EPIKA
The symbol of the village has come alive.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlume is turning again after years.
It is seen by far, because it is placed on a 15-meter high mast.
People in the broad vicinity call it the “winder on Chlum”
For the village, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal character, which the municipality gained for the occasion of a meeting of natives in 2010.
“We asked for a sign and we wanted to have a windmill on the sign, of course, everyone knows it around,” said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chluma wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a little bit of a reminder of the present: it reminds us of the time when the local people were fighting for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
It was not until 1910 that the Chluma representatives decided on a solution that was suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village next to the branch to China, they had a seven-metre-deep well emanated.
Three years later, the well was complemented by a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point in the village, near the church.
The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia with a cost of 2 400 crowns,” says a commemorative inscription on the ground floor fence of the mast construction.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter of the water struggle began to be written: on that day, a new pipeline began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and rarity.
The dominant was launched at this year’s meeting of natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlums decided that the wind bike would be repaired and re-introduced.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced on average by half a meter.
The bike was placed on a mast, but that same year it had to be carried down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist the glacial wind.
Then the chlumic dominance rested for several years under the roof.
However, since this June, the bike on the high mast is turning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village let the replica of the bike be adjusted and again placed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws the utility water from the well only into an overflow blind shoulder.
And over the summer we separated it completely, because there was little water in the well.
At least it turned empty.
“In the autumn, we disconnect the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction basket again,” said Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic, where the wind bike has entered the municipal sign, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole of Vysočina.
Similar elements in the sign are in honor of local technical monuments such as Chvalkovice and Zelené Hora in Vyškovsk, Kuzelov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerovsko or Police in Vsetínsk.
I don't know anything in bad, but I don't know Lafatu, she admits the backdrop of Tripoli Goian.
“I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal as everyone in my career,” Goian smiled at a pre-game press conference.
We were trained by Georghe Hagi at the time, it was a shame that we lost.
I hope to have a goal right now, Sparta.
The only difference is that we won’t lose this time,” Goian continued.
It is this man who played 60 matches for the Romanian team who is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face attacks of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Greek duel, the Hybsh.
He knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Astra in Romania with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their matches.
I know he's a very good assailant, so he went to Sparta too, said Goian.
Another footballer of the Prague club did not name, so there was a direct question whether he knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a lightly defamatory look, aimed at Czech journalists.
He said, “Why do you ask me?”
After a moment of silence, he started.
We saw some videos and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else except Fatai.
The couple knows this very well about Goian.
“He has experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such their organizer of the game,” said Stanislav Hejkal, an assistant of Spartans.
Goian has had the best years in his life, but he can boast of a very interesting football biography.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both United and City Manchester, from Steauy, was interested in him, but he went to Palermo, Italy, and played for Glasgow Rangers.
We are looking forward to an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a large team, regularly playing European Cups, pens of victory in the Czech League.
For me, it is a favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very much looking forward to the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The actions we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, Kofola Group’s financial director.
In connection with the transfer of the group’s registered office, shareholders are considering the location of the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Due to the entrance to the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes a prospectus of securities, which will be submitted by the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding seat and related transfers of shares will be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
As part of this operation, no shares will be offered to the public or to new investors.
“A possible offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016,” the company said.
In the past, the company said that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test the objectivity of Czech TV in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the news of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they are taught at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today’s broadcast of Czech Television Events.
The migrant crisis was devoted about 80% of the broadcast of the news.
Only for the first minute, when the ČT informed about unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police called them euphemistically lost their patience - they threw stones and attacked metal bars), the current pro-migration propaganda was already taking place - judge yourself the names of individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Refugee travel - The Czech Republic consistently uses the terms a runner or a refugee and not a migrant.
What is striking is that the Czech Republic uses only consistently and only pictures of small children and women in illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda, which does not resemble communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once I got up to a panel house, I soon stopped being the only resident.
The fishers moved to my bathroom.
Homemade fish, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not making that transformation from a housewives to a grinder and youth looks like an adult individual, just being small and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me and I didn't let them lose weight.
First manually and later chemically.
The socialist drugstores for their disposal provided some kind of blue crystals.
I think it's called Cyclon B.
Or something else?
However, it has been destroyed successfully.
Later, I did the same with Pharaohs.
A box with a Juvenalizer that the ants brought to the nest, and then he did not allow the queen to generate a new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went by, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to think that they have the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from life that interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace the other.
The truth about fleas and puppies, I wouldn't think I'd make my karma worse by killing them.
In our new residence, we agreed with our partner that if the fish didn’t walk behind our necks, let them eat the dandruffs of depleted skin, some invisible eyelashes, and so on.
Their peaceful existence after a while disrupted the spider.
It was a common type of penitent who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he was living from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he has lived with us for several years, we have found that he feeds mainly on fishes and that their number seems to have been maintained on a busy number of occasions.
We have found that she is a female with a close regular contact with every need we have made.
In fact, we witnessed romantic talks with a partner about a third smaller than careful webbings on webbings, so as not to be eaten before reaching the desired copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move or react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They disappeared soon.
The works were eaten by the mother, and the work was scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she left or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared again on the ceiling.
True, a little bit smaller, probably the daughter of that old man of the toilet.
For some time, from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior and, by moving under the toilet bowl, evaluated our non-aggression as a friendship.
The numerous condition of slightly protruding fishes decreased, and the spider quietly looked at his normal activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem has not changed all year.
Our daughter in between reached an age when the use of the nightmare was already a shame.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal spilling of its content has already taken care of us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
Her daughter, however, found an excuse in the spider to keep her habit, which she saw very well while she was cleaning.
Our talk about the spider seeing, she didn't take the luck of having in the house at all.
With crying and screaming, she forced her nightmare.
It wasn't too bad.
There was a time when the spider, in the interest of the developmental shift of the daughter, had to recommend.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and cast over a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I felt as bad after such a long relationship as if I were throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and begin to multiply with a geometric line.
The world wonders, a week, two, there was no one out there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider was there after the ant model somehow did not grow that the toilet environment was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already sneaking again.
I had to figure out another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their ties to the spider had to have a cause in that when they did not see him, he was hidden in some other place and that they were at risk from anywhere.
Heaven, they may have had some kind of telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them has caused some alarming reaction.
I don’t think I’m making any illusions about their eyes.
Some of the light of the shyness showed, but that they would react to wavering hands or rapid movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot about the nightmare.
It's all about attracting a spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether and I hope they haven't left me behind after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that B.
Ten words by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century seem to never cease to fascinate humanity.
He was able to immerse himself in everything so deeply that the result was always a staggering finding.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He entered the consciousness of people primarily his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic relation.
It can also be overlooked by clarifying the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so complex for many, that for closer familiarity they prefer to choose simple measures.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn’t be Albert Einstein if he hadn’t found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The clock near your loved one seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour - and that’s relativity.
I have allowed myself to choose from his entire plethora of famous quotations these ten that have literally captivated me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, the genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No number of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
The only one, however, can prove that I was wrong at any time.
But it’s a sad time when it’s easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War III, but in the fourth, it's going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't forgive not to put Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue behind the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlín Region are waiting for 1.5 billion changes.
“It’s a success when we consider that all four are in black numbers this year,” said Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of regional facilities is at the moment about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally beneficial for this year as well.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, this leads to constructions that together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long time when we were buying mainly the equipment is over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care can not be done, the regional deputy for health care Lubomír Nečas has justified the plans.
They look forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are currently choosing for almost 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž, they have a planned port of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to deploy a new intern to the open central pavilion this year for about 200 million.
And the Zlín Baťa Hospital is waiting for a long-delayed construction of a new central income and internal, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
“This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and physicians,” Věra Prousková, the director of the hospital, said.
The five-storey building there is to be finished in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
The changes that patients are particularly familiar with will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick in one room, on the floor have only one toilet, the beds are unobstructable, the windows are leaky and the health caregivers do not have adequate conditions for work.
“For example, our interior was built fifty years ago and is now at the limit of its lifetime,” said Pavel Calábek, director of Zlín Hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute departments in one place, in addition to in new spaces.
The same model already has half finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already worth it and will be added internally within three years.
“We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds,” explained Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still the highest, and it has not been lost two years ago, when the Zlín hospital was faced with nearly two hundred million losses.
“We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital,” Vlastimil Vajdák, who is responsible for the economy, said in a statement.
The improvements will also be made for patients of the Ecclesiastical Hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repairs, new instruments and reconstructions.
This year will be the finished repair of the capture station, then the port of dialysis, or building a building for a new magnetic resonance will begin.

No one explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains, after dealing with his European colleagues, that the rest of the Czech Republic is pushing for quotas to redistribute refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how to keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live in the same way.
“We didn’t get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text,” Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can’t talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have visions, they are heading somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we could keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with it.
We've been talking about it for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've recently dealt with forty thousand, now it's one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in the area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, and others who take the Czech Republic as their destination country are to come to us, but the interest of people in this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is very close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees do not want us, but fifteen hundred people have already been committed to accept us.
Couldn’t it be possible to take more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even the 1500 is that there will be 1,100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility and we will treat them just as we did to those we caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe whether we can hold the people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in such a way that, if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet there can be that even the 1100 will not be kept in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will return to Germany after they arrive.
If we can hold them for asylum proceedings, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, will receive almost 98 percent of European statistics.
They will then receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that is currently underway, and we have only advanced there by discussing with the Churches the possibility that they could help them find employment, accommodation and so on.
But that's a run on a very long track.
You said the other states were not willing to discuss with us at the ministers' meeting.
But isn’t it that the Czech Republic is simply rejecting quotas, but does it offer no solidarity to unblock the debate?
What exactly do you think is a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany tells us that all migrants from Syria can come to them, the report spreads in the order of hours after all the camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migration wave that goes to Germany because they just don’t want us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage those migration waves, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
They clearly show that they don’t have a chance.
Five thousand Kosovos came to Germany last year.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state prosecutors.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty percent of what social systems spend in vain on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was 12.
Where does it go to make border checks even stronger?
We were afraid of being captured by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred seats in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we hold will be back to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people away from us, it's complicated with Hungary, and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where is the breakpoint?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacity so much that crisis plans will take place.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister to immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are several times a day in telephone contact.
If the situation were to occur, the government could sit de facto immediately and one resolution would decide to strengthen the police about the army, let's give it a customs administration or a prison service.
Is the state of emergency declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think this can happen to us that far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to this on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, shows that Hungarians will try to shift the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be very marginal, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a lot of the debt at the last minute.
It is trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid the debts.
The footballers also got their money.
Football Slavia first came to court on Tuesday for the first time.
Almost three months after the proposal was filed by Online Services of Pacific Samoa for around 20 million crowns.
The lawyer Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince the judge Michael Wenzl within a few hours that she was not to declare a decline over Slavia.
And it must be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the previous week the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimána.
There was money coming from new owners to the club at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia’s statement before Tuesday’s court hearing - the Vršovice club on Monday, just the day before the trial, he sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
“Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15,” said Slavia Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, the Slovak representative Milan Ivan or Czech midfielder Maria Ličko.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid the debt fees of the Prague 10 city district.
As part of the insolvency dispute, only the claims that Slavie contradicts remain de facto.
Either the club does not have the obligations at all, or there are lawsuits about them.
However, we are ready in case of losses of these disputes to pay the amount.
“We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove by extracting from the account,” the lawyer Mládková told the judge.
“All that has been paid after maturity is paid,” Young said, adding that defaults are only outstanding or disputed obligations.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send out detailed evidence that she had actually paid those debts.
Then all the evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can be expected first in November.
The judge ordered a continuation of the hearing on November 3.
However, the decision will not take place at this meeting, but only in writing.
Medals for Finns and Austrians.
FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of cutting-edge technology, hardware and software integrated into modular construction brings benefits and a rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And whatever, from welding of structural steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in the yard.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple adjustment and expansion of the welding source enables quick response to changing requirements, leading to a reduction in downtime, the need to rebuild the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables uslding with cutting-edge welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
It ceases to waste time and does not waste material or repair faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there are fewer downtimes, more welding and higher profit.
This year’s news was premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honours very much because they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world’s leading leaders.
For interested parties there are certainly pleasant and delivery times that range around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly expand after the Brno fair.
We have been its regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasizes ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, Head of the Kemppi Store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanke was built so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanke was able to beat more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built so that there were no two falls of the ground in the Stromovce in Prague, says Satra, the production director of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said it on Wednesday night during a tunnel tour.
It would be half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and security.
“Tunnel was going to beat safer, but the costs were growing,” Butovich said.
The conditions in Stromovce were the same all the time, but the country fell only a few steps away from where it began to hit with a safer and more cautious method.
“If these measures were used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive,” Butovich said.
The Blanka tunnel fell three times during the construction.
Two times, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the land fell at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he said.
The construction was intended to cost 17 billion crowns.
When we add to this the VAT, which has doubled during the construction period, you are 21 billion.
When technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items are added to this, it is 29 billion, which is no longer that far back from 37, Whitehead said.
Someone ordered it and paid it.

Profits of FedEx mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfied results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in forecasting year-round profit due to low demand for freight transport and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on vacation.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous predictions.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes in spite of an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will show up in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large parcels that start in November.
The company said it was still expecting a profit increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher income and growth in online trading.
The Chairman of the Board and CEO of Fred Smith said the company was “perpetuating firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade”
Vacation hire plans were announced the day after the rival UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, which is about the same as last year.
In a quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx acquired $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a drop in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping strengthened the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit dropped in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before FedEx opened, FedEx’s shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a fall of 11% per year and 17% below the record of June 11.
At its most anticipated session in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days sitting at a 27-foot long Honda Mahogany table this week and decide whether it will be time to raise the key interest rate after almost ten years.
Standing above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep the prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced Thursday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch when weaning from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid growth in the economy, recent financial markets in the world could already scare the careful Fed out of adding to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds, even by nothing more than just a quarter of the percentage point.
“It is clear that the labour and inflation market will be first and foremost the most important thing to follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for a pretext to not increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of recent economists surveyed by Blomberg predicted an increase in rates this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates only if politicians mitigate the decline in the promise that further increases are unsupervised.
On Tuesday, the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, at 16,599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would hold rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed were raising rates now,” he said.
If the Fed politicians did, they would have to go to the extremes in their program statement and hold hands to the financial markets to avoid panic.
Other experts argued that increasing rates would calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow-strengthening monetary conditions that would confirm the power of economic recovery in the U.S.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, rates are expected to rise this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Salary gains showed signs of lifting.
And while inflation continues to be below the annual 2% target of the central bank, the Fed said that the main reason for this was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
“Economics can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon’s chief economist.
But financial markets around the world began to throw away at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell by as much as 16% below its record value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would pull down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected this month and Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May peak.
The Fed’s political leaders add a complex calculation to the uneasy situation on the market, when to calculate an increase in interest rates.
“In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of China’s weakness over the past few weeks, there would be a toughening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA’s lead researcher, Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and there are almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A mere indication of Ben S. Bernanke’s then president in 2013 that the Fed could “restrict” their monetary expansion on the market, has triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly connected, Fed leaders can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they also consult other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global wealth management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that “Fed has a history of over-exposed movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Policy Committee’s policymaking committee, pushed for an increase in rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
“The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to a reduction in its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions, despite limited identifiable impacts on growth in the U.S.,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should favour concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee setting rates at the Bank of England.
The latest noise is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets got angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I do not think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
The Chinese Quarter
The market/storey was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it is a Chinese neighborhood and not a Thai district.
The market/store is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little bit of motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to cross all the aisles.
If you’re hungry about all this shopping, go to a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inner business stand (good, cheap) is close to the registries and has various collection points.
What is in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
At LAX-C you will probably find it.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large.
Mez fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The expansion of meat is large, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash you and your feces, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing compartment, where you will find frozen karma leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-sale semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide streets meet shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will remain at the old speed.
The House rejected the acceleration at 150 km/h.
On selected motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided when it came to the amendment of the Senate, which refused to increase speed.
The legislation on land communications will now go to the president.
At the end of April, President Miloš Zeman said the law would veto the speed of one hundred and fifty meters.
The Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for YES) said the Czech highway network was not yet built on such speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-flow roads.
The House first extended this possibility to highways, where it could be used in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport from the amendment, also excluded the right of the transport police to have the last word when adjusting local communications that the municipalities care about.
The Senate version, approved by the House, is also expected to allow sewage, taps or public lighting cables to be stored along the road surface.
The village would thus save for the purchase of land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant plot.
The amendment will also help to improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle drawn vehicles they do not report to.
Newly, municipalities could sell drawn vehicles which, within a six-month period after notification of withdrawal, their owners would not apply.
The municipalities will have the opportunity to exclude transit freight across their territory on second and third-class roads under the threat of fines for shipping companies.
The amendment also repeals the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of existing paper stamps, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The U.S. expressor goes to court.
He is at risk for 10 years for the welcome of his citizens.
The case concerns the alleged project Welcome of Citizens.
The police wanted to prosecute Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not release her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, between two and ten years of imprisonment are at risk.
The main account is currently scheduled for two October days.
According to Mandík and Macik, at least one million crowns have been damaged, according to the charges.
The applicant is based on an expert opinion.
The former members of the city’s management, according to the applicant, were unlawfully allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the citizens’ welcome.
Mandík, then head of the master’s field of urban services, education and culture, has ordered him to address five connected companies in the selection procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the council of the city of order.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both allegations conducted to ensure Darothore’s award of a public contract for the organisation of the Welcome of Citizens event in Usti nad Labem have acted in a long-term and coordinated manner at least contrary to the requirement for the proper economic care procedure.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore, following the acquisition of this contract, would charge Usti nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome of Citizens event, which would be disproportionately increased compared to the actual value of the services provided.
In three years, the company paid more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid, according to the expert opinion, was exceeded by at least one million crowns.
Mandík has previously rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don’t understand this case, the former mayor said earlier that the city, under his leadership, was just following a similar project from the previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, Roxy II provided the event.
“It was under the same conditions, for the same money,” added Mandík.
The criminals wanted to accuse Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the House of Deputies did not release it for prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but are counting on Kail to blame her after her term of office ends.
Welcoming citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift cheque of CZK 5,000 to buy children’s supplies and small gifts.
The Hungarian police reportedly released a dog.
Then they made journalists delete the record.
The Hungarian police said on the border with Serbia briefly arrested the AP cameraman and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the country of the refugee.
However, the Hungarian government is questioning this allegation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the corn field near Röszke, Hungary.
The refugees were attacked by police officers, and one of them was allowed to attack a Syrian dog with a basket on a pacifier.
The dog of the man who shouted, “Please, I am a refugee,” said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was noticed by one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist could no longer call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark spot at the Refugee Registration Center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
In this way, he lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
AP sent a letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
The behavior of policemen in it was considered unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and did not have to worry that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács questioned the police report on the events.
He said the police just wanted the journalist to show them if they were on some shots, which they said they had the right to do.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete.
\"Dogs can bark - they are trained to scare and get a little scared, but they are not sure to attack,\" Kovács said.
Unforeseeable Champions League.
Winning the City will kick us, Juventus believes
“It’s a disappointment, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” said Manuel Pellegrini, coach of hometown.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the Champions League.
Not one team created a lot of opportunities, but we had a ball on the moats longer.
“The reason for the defeat was not in the tactic, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals,” said Pellegrini, the team’s team in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season, Juventus, was exactly the opposite before the encounter - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, the title advocate has only a point and the 2:4 score is up to the 16th place of the table.
Therefore, the turn at the Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
“This win will help us mentally, it will kick us,” said Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year, Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester they were represented by Pogba, Manjukic and Morata.
“That’s right, this victory is so important that we can make it a winning wave,” Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attack phase.
My players deserve this result.
“Before our leveling goal, we were able to score at 0:2, but Gianluigi held us back,” Allegri’s goaltender Buffon praised.
“We burned a few good chances,” said Jayu Touré, a midfielder of the City.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye, Angela, goodbye to the old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all the media shaking around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and from above.
So let's just stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children who carry their parents on the hands of their parents along the dusty paths of exodus.
And this creates a sense of guilt and compassion automatically in a person - in a European person.
Well, they don't just come here for desperate children, notice the shots of landing boats to the Greek islands, that children don't see so much on them!
And we've been missing pictures of ships heading to Lampedus recently, refugees from the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men lie on the beautiful promenades.
A lot of young blacks.
And the pictures also disappeared from Callais, where they eat, and black men wait for them to get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's taking it anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not make any special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow hidden that it is not only unhappy children from Syria, but also built up - for the elderly: fashionablely prolific - young men.
Their musculatures look like they just got out of some fitness center.
Only one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish-Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of the fact that she was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And young boys came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in branded clothes and shoes. In their hands, as otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested and employees - the Turks, the Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They took all the chairs.
He who was not lying on him and was in the sea had bad luck.
They were dressed from an American rapper film.
On the head of the hat with nails, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then the local beach bar was besieged and they started to grow.
They took the tables around, filled themselves next to the eating and white guests of the bar, reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere quiet.
The incoming blacks drank beer straight from thirds - as in the U.S. series? - they threw empty bottles around on the beach.
They shouted loudly at each other.
It was not English, of course.
Then they drink wine, even from bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimwear, especially those young ladies - in the water they cried and cried, mothers with children and pensioners fled horrifiedly, and in half an hour there was no longer a beach or swimming pool nor a single non-black guest.
Everybody's gone.
No matter if there was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, “You saw the gold that they were wearing.”
“Yes,” I said.
“They certainly didn’t have it from work,” said the waiter.
I remembered: “I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had about a 20-metre heavy cross of gold on his neck.
Women were like gold.
“These are drug traffickers,” I asked.
“You have seen them drink,” said the waiter.
They don't even use drugs.
They smuggle something completely different.
So I was already aware of what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 this was not so important to me.
I didn't know what to do next.
But secret services and top politicians should have known this first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and their related lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - already publicly recognized the main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, also the tops of the EU and TV, including ours.
For example, recent television images about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of pictures of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Sure, there were a couple of sunflowers at the station, but mainly - ancient German - Muslims welcomed their soukmen.
For many weeks, the news reported on Czech TV, according to a study by the Germans, almost all of them for the arrival of immigrants.
But who has only been in Germany for a few days knows that it is a lie like a tower.
This confirms further information.
For example, the famous research of public opinion organized by ARD - the Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to receive even more refugees a week ago.
That was also what our televisions were doing.
However, they concealed what broke in Germany the next day: that in the poll vote on the article it turned out that 94.5% of Germans no longer want any immigrants - 67,000 people participated in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, i.e. five years ago: “Our efforts to ‘multi-kulti’ society totally failed.
She said, “Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.”
“Every effort to do this has failed completely.
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said she did not testify to a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating. Today they live with us and we have been lying for some time that they will not remain, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, when we think we are just living happily side by side, has failed this approach.
Absolutely failed.
But not even Merkel has the power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This shows the escalation of events.
Conflict is increasing rapidly.
The European Parliament’s President, SPD Member, the only one who reportedly has no university in the European Parliament - yes, that’s the one Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play a concentration guard from a minute ago - he’s been showing himself as he’s done many times.
It appears, especially under the impression of the last statements of German politicians, that Germany exceeded Rubikon.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, statesmen of countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least externally, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and killer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, supremacy and violence is in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the attempts of the Grandparents to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was suspended, he began preparing for World War I.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, has probably returned in another form.
After trying to control the state of Marxists, for example, with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, for example, which by the way was one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say the sun.
The German elites long defended the emergence of German nationalism, leaving in peace all those warriors against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, silently supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something differently and better in the world, fully leaned to the side of the warriors against the heating of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and an anti-Slovak current that considers all Slavs a difficult verb - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jew, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the last statements of Schulze and German ministers show openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leading Germany.
They need to be listened to without excuse.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we combine the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is worth, as always, the capital, especially the German capital, to which it suits and which is the result that Germany, through banks and the Union, controls most of the European countries.
The Sunni Pseudovirus first introduced the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multi-cluralism, and today it brought them home and will bring millions of Muslims.
Those who, attracted by the voices of the sirens, will come soon to the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and will begin to storm.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force, once again can a part of its inhabitants - but, as it seems, an ever smaller part - ideologically abhorrent, but eventually reality will catch it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are already burning.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the incoming Islamists break out?
Jim will be helped by Muslims living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws.
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, who follow the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will this do with the Germans, and Germany at all, when the people who protest loudly and publicly against the new euro-permanent Muslim will rise up?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which has sparked in Europe the support of the solar ideology, i.e. the ideology of the elite and, in principle, the totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the immeasurable action against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the submissive and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of inflatable sellers: to scare them to death.
It is enough to knock, and the robust knock will come to you in a way that the weaker nature does not have to stand.
The head of life will shake you up and drive you back and forth, and the living statue will accompany you (or rather, the relentless seller) and the living statue.
Maybe it's a shame that the talker can't actually do it.
It would also be useful for us to avoid a lot of spouts and moustaches.
Pink juice (Oxalis corniculata).
Small weed that tolerates dry environment.
And so it is located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to the expansionary weeds, but looks like a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
There are outdoor tiles.
She's unquestionable, she's doing well with us in the garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easy to adapt, modest and unpretentious.
Although he creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth watching and photographing.
The beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment are still under consideration.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diet
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey knowledge to women about the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding with images of children sucking from the breast painted by the display of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess of energy requirements, pregnant women and newly baked mothers are recommended to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic formation of their children and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead at Today's Show
With Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson at Canberra to cover the cost of the liberal leadership escape, it failed to create a sufficient rating increase for Today.
A morning show of Nine from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, fell into London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem to matter so much about this tyranny of distance to Aussie TV viewers, as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals compared to 330,000 broadcasters today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343,000).
Today has filled the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators and 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
Wind changes affecting more than just parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand, has an average of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could pull down a television hit without Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night's evening is clear - yes -
The X Factor from Seven has kept a strong 1.136 million viewers, defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed follow-up on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new television quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), which was reported by Andrew O'Keefe, had an average of 446 000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators, which was enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat by Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
With the fall of The Chase Australia's second night rating, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat the McGuir show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who does he choose?
Secrets revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly found out who would win the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelora is encircled in an unsurpassed mystery.
And the three girls who stay standing will definitely not tell who the right one is, which will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they told us thankfully who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue for his teeth until Thursday's finale
All three women have songd Lyrically why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positiveness as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, “If not, who gets Wood’s final flower?”, their answers could work as a spoiler about who gets Bachelor’s heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would best fit with Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared an easy relationship from a certain day.
“From the moment I entered the house and watched Sarah and Sam’s energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think that during the course,” Jevaons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is really a country woman, she’s a lot of fun,” Markoski said.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are good together and pleasant.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a good couple.
She claims that during her last visit at home, she realized that Wood could be “the right one.”
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now,” he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not for her, to look mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love both girls as much - it's between Snezen and Lana indecisively.
Bachalor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after moving him to the United States, and many teams asked for his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some trainers let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by the conversion of the Australian rugbi league at the first excavation of the excavation at the Tuesday win of 20:3 to Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him into the game after the injury of the neither.
Tomsula was also honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing the new ones in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and take care of just another game.
Already during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne fixed his mistake.
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured in broadcasting when he left the field after an error and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 the worse beginning of his NFL career he could not imagine.
“That’s what happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goalland led to the Queensland Troika.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans who hold the Australian flag on their own Instagram after playing.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin meet in a debate on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested on a Siberian range.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. has stood up for immigrants who have sought compensation for property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property acquired a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to become a claim for compensation under the Act on Out-of-court Rehabilitation.
The court first assigned them the amount requested, i.e. more than 2.8 million crowns, but the appeal court changed their claim by granting them only 90 thousand crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Emigrants were arrested by the Supreme Court and the amount originally charged to them.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay off the money, turned to a complaint with the U.S.
In the meantime, there was such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although at that time it constituted an adequate compensation in relation to the property taken away - today only reaches a fractional amount of the property value.
“This cannot go to the burden of side participants as a restitution of eligible persons seeking their rights at least since 1995 and who have not been able to provide compensation before,” explains Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S. has stood on the side of immigrants.
“The U.S. has repeatedly spoken in order for the general courts to proceed in restitution cases so that possible inaccuracies are not interpreted in favour of legitimate persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. the restitution of property crimes caused by acts of the former totalitarian state,” the judge added.
Evituum in the music studio DVA is now produced by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, by the way, became the world’s youngest Evitou by the time in 1998 she played the role of the wife of Argentina’s dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timea Rice in Prague’s Spirála Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says: “To this day, the difficulty of Evita has not been balanced by the power of the performance.”
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended as First Lady of Argentina by Monika Absolon.
I saw a monster three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I suddenly saw a whole new concept here.
I am quite a supporter of the more modern modifications, but this one is especially successful.
“The director Andrew Sokol is original, light and contemporary,” notes Fišarová.
The ingenious transmission of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolon’s Birthday Concert on September 27th from 19th at Studio DVA.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include the Don't Cry For Me Argentina duet (Argentino!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondrej Sokol will also jump away from the screenplay when he replaces Karl Roden in the role of President Peron for the film.
For the sake of public interest, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech studio of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Usedful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondre Sokol, Monika Absolon originally studied the main female role.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President of Peron and as Che Peter Strnáčik.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech lyrics by Michael Prostejovský sound in the performance of a live orchestra under the direction of Christopher Mark, who has already participated in the first appearance at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police shot rubber projectiles at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber projectiles into a crowd of protesters against the draft new state constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital.
Bisnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officer, says more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern Nepal plain, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in West Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which demands the establishment of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, lawmakers voted in Kathmandu on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We must not panic now.
After losing on the ice of Litvínov, you didn’t even manage a home duel with the Spartan hockey players (3:5).
Are you concerned about such catastrophic entry into the extraliga as a year ago?
I hope nothing like that does not happen again.

NHC predicts 60% cyclone probability south of Cape Verde
A broad low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde’s southernmost islands is likely to be 60 percent in the emergence of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, about in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antillies, also has a 60 percent probability of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added the weather forecast based in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states with war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog on a very unusual way.
The blog was published by Google employee Rita Masudo based on her personal experience as she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven-year-old.
“We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the deteriorating immigration crisis in Europe is becoming more and more families, like her, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided into four non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said all posts made via Google.com/refugeerelief will double to $5.5 million.
Europe has been facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, with the most of them coming from Syria thrown away by a four-year war that has driven 4 million people this year.
Many people also flee from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For moderately obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
“The data on mortality takes a long time to see,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an introductory to a new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric operations have proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMI, which measures the weight-related relationship, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or more indicate the overweight of a person and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007, dealing with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastroectomy - in treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes, roughly the same as 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36% and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1% and partly only 2% of patients were completely resolved to compare diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol has been shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient’s A1c haemoglobin level in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar level in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8%.
But this better-glycemic control - which is reflected at better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group with bypass lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater drops in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent) and had a higher chance of diabetes remission (46.9% vs. 16.7 percent).
While a new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chances of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgical patients, according to Blackstone, this is a calming result for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
“It is here that this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group,” he said.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a decrease in patient’s BMI between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long for people to show the severity of the situation,” he says.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that will firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with the study of ethics at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK, has been addressed by the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in his speech.
He claimed that under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“To take care of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you’ll have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
“The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also expressed his views on the actions against George Bush following a 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “a violent response by the U.S. has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my sincere sympathy in President Bush’s letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences,\" the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have consumed a sanitation agent in the last four years
Toxicological centers around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase from 2010 in the number of children under 12 years old who swallowed a high-alcoholic sanitation agent, according to a toxicological center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia’s Toxicological Center, the number of sanitation in children under 12 years of age reported to have increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to standby,” said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Youtube videos show teens how they drink a sanitary device because of cheap habits.
Teens reportedly mixed a sanitary agent with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by an attractive smell of the medium.
“Children don’t think it could hurt them,” Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitatives) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary products with the aroma of strawberry, Cmax or oranges that are very attractive to children.
Sanitation contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several lokis can mean alcohol poisoning.
“This is highly concentrated alcohol,” said Fox 4 in Kansas City, a medical director of the control toxicological center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn’t just let the whiskey glass get past it, but people leave these sanitations out and when the kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently looked at up to four servings of sanitary agent with the aroma of strawberry and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke unmistakable words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital on account of any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell and broke into her head because of alcohol, Ritchey says.
“It was very scary,” said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to make sure that the sanitation was within the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitations have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary agent containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Medical professionals believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in North New York City planned to poison their “bad” teacher by deploying antibacterial products in the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and prohibits their presence in the room.
The police assessed the dream plan as “innocent squeezing,” referring to the discipline of the school district,
Fáma: No mismatch in Celtic team
Griffins downplays talks about the mismatch in Celtic while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it over again.
Hearts will fight SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that new reinforcements in January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons raises their lead over Celtic by 5 points
Penalty from the first half of ADAM Rooney's submission provided Aberdeen with a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, making Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtice.
Griffins denying talks about non-conformity
This situation provoked the disconformity in Celtic, which was denied by Griffins, who insists that he and his fellow players do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for a match with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivalry boring Netherlands - de Boer
Former Ranger Rangers and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer say Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them due to the title.
De Boer, currently Ambassador to Ajax, says: “In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic’s matches, and why,”
Because there are no Rangers anymore.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
He's talking about the old company.
He talks about both teams together and that’s what he’s interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the games of the Old Company and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I turn things back to good, Deil is committed.
Roony Dealia admitted Celtic was a little bit stuck, but Norway's chief committed to turning things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent fallout of the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, “Celtic has already experienced a bad period and will rise again.”
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current happening.
We're on the same thing, but we have to keep going.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it is very important to stay with each other.
Warburton is worried about January's reinforcements.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is concerned about the great purchase of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the team from Ibrox.
Former head of Brentford says: ‘The January transfer window is very different from that summer’
Players coming in the summer have a whole pre-season period to live up to, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage arises by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transition target suggests retirement
Swansea Mich, who was associated with Celtice in a transfer window, suggested that he could retire after his contract expired.
A 20-year-old shooter has been in trouble with a prone ankle for two years and couldn’t find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson says, “I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance.”
Griffins is committed to avoiding Tynecastle
The hard-headed Hibbe was severely punished after he admitted to singing a song with a text aimed at the former player Hearts Rudolfa Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn pub in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
“It was a derby and it was a hot moment,” the attacker said and continued, “I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it’s in Celtic’s dress.”
The Tannadice Council believes in the management of Dundee United - Donella
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in remedying the situation with the current team management - but admits that the fall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boy again for action,” Donnelly promises.
MCinnes likes to win against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to stick desperately against Hamilton Accies in order to win the seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead ahead of Celtice at the top of the table thanks to the first half penalty given to Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, “There is no team that has won anything, whether it be cups or leagues, without winning this type of match.”
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged, while total UK unemployment is rising
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged for the number of 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK rate (5.5 percent) as shown by data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers now stopped to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the British average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland Secretary of State David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest data: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It is almost a year ago that Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months, we witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment grew, while unemployment decreased.
Why I witnessed execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I'll be watching a man's death.
If this happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January despite my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I’m starting to worry about it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to monitor executions in America and because there are often more requests than free seats, a morbid lottery is carried out that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will follow the execution unbiasedly.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a special bond to him over the months of calls and one two and a half hours of visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison report says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the keeper as he pleases, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that “it could have been better,” but she still thinks what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, Huffington Post journalist, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would have made him guilty of complicit in a crime.
But I believe there is a high probability that he is innocent of murder.
I definitely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
It is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love to die an unnecessary death.
Man Escapes From Canning River After Police Girl
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he drove the men out of Canning River.
A man's bet from Petra's escape from the police didn't come out after he got into shallow mud water just meters away from a police officer who tried to forcelessly persuade him to return to shore.
The Canning Vale police were summoned in an incident exceeding Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by running across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
“He stood in the water and repeated ‘I’m not going out, just come for me,’” said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to soak up his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and police negotiation.
“People sometimes try to do funny things while running away,” Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins went by car to the excavation to avoid the bus and tried to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired locals to start planning Ben Cousins’ biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria that he tried to get a spy last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organizer and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scratch of Lady Tatai in maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidar's positive cobalt trim, which he can't explain.
He bit into his tongue about espionage charges for 18 months and didn’t want it to look like ‘dry grapes’.
“I didn’t want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to go up with my head and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I would then have to consider what I will do with my license.
Previously, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
“The eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would name after a question, and offered him a job in my stables for finding information about the things that are being done in my stables,” Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a scammer.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an effort to catch me they totally burned me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Saundry, current RVL CEO, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Will RVL allow a couple of balls to grow and make sure that people outside the training position take responsibility for what is going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt what I'm saying now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will press on them, and I will carry the burden upon them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go away.
Coach frustration levels have increased with long-term investigation due to cobalt, including Lidari, and recent scratches in it have made it feel like they could be licensed to the table for hours.
Moody, best known for preparing the unbeated champion Black Caviar, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the race as \"funny\" - after a clay or mud applied to the legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
“I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
Someone from my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened too.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for the treatment of tiles on the day of the race to which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that we need the rules, but this went too far,” Moody said.
The Cobra driver who ran away was arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra this weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia admitted himself to the Shepparton Police.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
A Cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in a stable state in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy returns to the rivals due to the Wrestling Claims
Craig Bellamy, a Melbourne Storm coach, criticized the actions of his players as \"setting a plan\" two NRLs of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters coach, said the referees allowed Storm players to “rest” his players during the controversial Storm team victory in the Sydney qualifying final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, the coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a lightly covered note on Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game as \"the tour\" of the rugby league, and according to him two of Queensland were not \"too big\" at Wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said they focused on “contact” during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his self-confidence because his team is criticized by two managers, which may mean they are afraid of defeating the Storm team.
“I don’t remember Trent Robinson talking about Wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” he said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have changed nothing from our defensive system and techniques, we have only put emphasis on contact during the procedures, and that meant a turnaround for us.
Trent's been here for three years and obviously he's training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how such things always come into this season.
Bellamy devalued Bennet’s idea of “arousing football” and reminded his mentor that Bennet’s team of St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership by playing “bodied” football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting,” Bellamy said.
In 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that makes him feel disruptive, especially his young midfielders at their speed.
You would like to play such football if you had this type of players available.
This opinion he said in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It raises more self-confidence in me because they say such things because they are afraid of a fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t even think of us when they got to big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals fell in Storm and Roosters than in Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and non-scoring attempts interesting?
I think it's an agenda.
If we are mentioned, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storms have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 in bail for drug charges
The man who faced possible lifetimes for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled from Queensland received a $200,000 bail.
Marko Makisovice (29 years old) was one of five men arrested last month by the federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drug from the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and in August anchored in Coomera.
Maxovic was seen in a meeting with the accused in a port during the morning and later met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for the possession of cocaine of commercial quality, the lawyer Maksimovice built the defense that there was no evidence that he owned the whole quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop completely by chance and innocently.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan thought he would have fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, he said in the middle of the court.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
A mother and stepfather together offered a deposit of $200,000 for his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of both people, it is clear that the deposited deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were apparently insufficient, because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maxovic was awarded a bail on condition that he gave up both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police every day and will follow the ban from 18 o'clock in the evening to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Steve Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then signed up for her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of the children sent him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing her phone and then found him in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found worrying news before she alerted her mother.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytics computers found the address and discovered ‘confident’ searches on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was “to bring pedophiles on the internet before he pretended to be a police officer and scared them”
Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: \"He said it was addiction - that he was dependent on the distress of people.
He admitted that he was doing a search on the computer, but he says he just wanted to pretend that he was a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another one.
He did it to attract them.
He claims to have jumped in his drunkness and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
He saw immoral images on his phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident in Ward Road, Dundee, has admitted to file an action to accept or provide inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, breached the terms of the bail on 25 January and failed to appear in court on 24 March this year.
A defense lawyer, Gregory Sim, asked Hogg not to be placed on a list of sex offenders because he could argue that there was no “essential sexual subtext” in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the judgment in October to report to social workers.
Hogg was awarded bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe delivered a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the stage.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also defiled by the claims of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats by killing them, which warned them of Mr Mugabe's depreciation during his speech.
Last month, he was published and provoked during his speech about the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians adopted text messages on their mobile phones with warnings not to hinder Mr Mugabe’s speech.
“The report comes from a number that doesn’t appear, but is called ‘death’,” he told reporters after Mr Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said Morgan Tsvangirai’s party had “fears” about threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts for business services.
HP will later split into two listed companies on the stock exchange and separate the computer and printer trade from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today, and it will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses switch to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual income of more than $50 billion and will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions to companies.
In 1930, Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment, and whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone massive reorganizations to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP move, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest of this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says players must get behind injured Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason not to play about Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four other English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then again got into the former form during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten a career,” Wenger said.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has only played in 65 league matches of the Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal begins the campaign at the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, that is, Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to enter.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite of the F-group, the Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stage in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season they kept the campaign “unbeatable”
On Wednesday night, the stadium was rocked by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
That was the seventh time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal learned from last season of the Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
“This deployment is huge,” Wenger said.
The arsenal never happened.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be a realist.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Male Friendship
The absence of similar shows in different shows is striking, especially given how men need to open up more desperately than ever when it comes to suicide among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) 2015 identified as the Year of a Man whose goal is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured person had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a ‘healthy mood,’ their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of developing mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need has doubled to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and the creator of the game recently explained, money doesn’t really buy more luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was for him the source of this idea.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shined through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stems from knowing that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying - to deal with it - is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the shows that arise in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the condition of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a larger close, a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to FrendsFest this weekend, organized by Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of celebration.
Or when you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central from start to finish - a total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG with Malmo's side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after a goal shot against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut at the Champions League and helped PSG defeat the Swedish Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the game and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored on Tuesday and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey at the Champions League with the final comfortable win of 2-0 against Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the goal less than four minutes after his debut at the Champions League and this PSG player sent the French champions for the victory, but then threw a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the decommissioning rounds, but also on improving their journey to the quarterfinals they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it was not the classic performance of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was in front of the goal and later he was replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
“In the Champions League, it’s not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents problems and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even if there are things we’ll have to improve with the season process,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of the three PSG team changes that took the 2-2 draw at home this weekend with Bordeaux at Lise 1, but was shadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who would move the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he hit Marc Verratti's pass for the defense of Malma and sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected it to start a spectacular PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got into this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the base lineup and five defenders and two midfielded midfielders were a tough opponent.
But in addition to Nikola Djurdjice, who had just missed Kevin Trapp’s remote corner in the 34th minute, they didn’t offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG was concerned about the benefits of the attack by bad passers-throughs and a poor ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovice, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived on the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he turned out to be much more appropriate when he came to prepare a chance for his teammate and it was from his pass when Di Maria sent a shooting shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayite had already sent him the sixth goal of this season after he had won him an Ibrahimovic after playing from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could benefit from something from the match, and only the excellent Wilanda intervention from a great close to ruin David Luize's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the alternating Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team admitted that PSG was a class higher than his team, Nor said: “Our last game at the Champions League took place in December last year.”
Since then, we have only played the Swedish League, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hat down for Paris.
It was a wonderful game for them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion for stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, made $2.5 billion on the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan on Wednesday.
Glencore said it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a decline in commodity prices as China’s slowdown in the economy reduces demand and arouses sparks of destruction across markets.
The rights issue was sent by Glencore to the top of London’s stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
The shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that selling $2.5 billion of shares is part of a broader plan to cut their debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence per share, which marked a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
This has resulted in 1.3 billion shares of a total value of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the extension of China’s growth brake decreased the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House says Washington has visited Xi Jinping.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the talks.
“The visit to President Xi represents an opportunity to strengthen the US-China relationship and encourages cooperation in addressing problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the disagreements of the two states,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was announced for the first time in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue to New York for the September United Nations meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address the disputed issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggression in South China’s waters.
How the refugee crisis scattered the Schengen area.
The emergency light fired by Germany did not stmmelly the European crew, but already forces the ship to change the course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union decided to deal with the problem of refugees: it would be more systematic to classify migrants and asylum seekers once they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing for the future distribution of refugees under quotas on the basis of a quantity that is increasingly giving up on reality.
Six days after President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the Interior Ministers of the Member States changed the priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of runners, it is necessary to first filter those who are coming today and solve the fate of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.
“Efficient management of the EU’s external borders is essential for managing migration,” he said in a statement on Monday.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds it at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases its pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
The Central Power makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia have already joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted under the Schengen rules.
It’s a domino effect, but it’s also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and Hungary for those who have already entered the country.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is realized stiffness.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived runners have already been registered and identified with fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory, because it is more afraid than others that there will be no camps on its hips where refugees will accumulate in its account.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as it has recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge glowing hole.
Athens, which is still in financial collapse and waiting for a new government, laid their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and the source of now common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker’s commission promises to introduce control points as soon as possible, but did not include any number or date.
“The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe,” EU Interior Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on the front.
It is therefore about deploying European Border Control Agency intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen island surveillance.
“The need for adequate financial resources will be adequate,” warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
In terms of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the emergence of genuine European border guards has not been raised officially, but Europe is approaching this.
The 28-year-old’s new emergency situation, in the same way, has shifted to the second turn the question of binding quotas and 160 000 refugees, which was created by Juncker’s Commission and the European Parliament earlier this year, which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was maintained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the 28-year-olds.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU hectic summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the lava in the Alps, three of them reportedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed the Lavine in the French Alps.
German nationality is also a woman who has survived as the only one affected by the eight-member group.
The previous media reports said it was about Poland.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury in the thigh area.
The dead were largely 40-year-olds according to AFP.
“The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims have also been transferred to Briancon to identify them,” said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the peak of the Dome de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 meters.
“The sudden lavage was 250 meters wide and about a meter high,” said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
At a height of about 3,900 metres, he found that a huge amount of snow was brewed on the eight-member group.
Today, the weather service did not warn the area of bad weather.
Trapišovsky before the match with Braga: Finally, the true Europe.
During his premier in the cup, coach Jindřich Trpišovský managed to cross the European League's premier over the European League and now he is happy to enjoy the right Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome the finalist from 2011 Bragu at the start of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to force her playing style.
After all the nerves in the fights, when every goal and every situation could have thrown you off on the road to a dream group, now we are there and we will play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to worry about every goal taken, we can play our tactics and we’re not tied to just two matches.
“I look forward to it and it’s a real Europe, before it was just a qualification,” said Trpišovský at a press conference.
Bragu thinks it's the top team.
It will be very active, they themselves have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at balls.
The opponent may be more difficult to name, but he has a player in his cadre who has three goals for Manchester.
“It’s an excellent whole at the top level of teams,” said Trpišovský.
But Bragu does not consider it a good favorite.
I think we're playing at home, so we're not outsiders.
“I think we have also shown in domestic competitions and forerunners that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that,” said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from the 11 duels of this season.
He believes that Liberec can also force Braze’s style.
A team who will be strong on the ball awaits us, at the same time, he is untypically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 layout with a quick transition to an attack phase.
“He is a very hard opponent, although we have discovered the weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the field,” said Trpišovský.
In the ancestrals we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted the trainings.
“And we definitely want, even if it will be very difficult to play according to our notes,” added the coach.
Student films will dominate the sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries registered their works for the 15th International Festival of Student Films in Písek this year.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the final by a committee of students and educators, will be screened in Portyč cinema from 15 to 18 October.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said the speaker of the festival Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has its own special theme, which depends on the festival sound.
She's a detective this year.
Richard Blumenfeld, director of this year’s festivities, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
“And, of course, we also have to solve the crime committed in our campaign this year,” Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student works - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, to which the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Shard will sit.
The organizers of the festival prepare an accompanying program as every year.
The Vatican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondrej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondrej Smeykal, turboshanson group Let's Fly?, a playful band of grains or, for example, Petra Hapková with a recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by the graduate of the sand film school and the winner of prestigious awards, among which there is also the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that reigned in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
The German film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the singers Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop a joint bond and a film craft,” the spokesperson said.
The Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, attend several job auditions at the same time and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of Private College of Professional Films in Písek.
Its founders, husbands Vladan and Miloň Terč, organized their first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the event of the bankruptcy of CK, the insurance companies are to pay the requirements of the clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay their clients’ claims in the event of the fall of the travel agency in full.
It was decided on Wednesday by the House, when it approved a revised amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace the bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to a template that aims to assess to the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay client claims and above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development is insisting on adjusting, arguing with consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to put an end to the insurance of travel agencies against failure when the amendment applies.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to end or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development, Karla Šlechtová (for YES), pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She pointed out this year’s decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, said Šlechtová.
“We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit as to be feasible,” said Vice-President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
“Travel agencies will have to stop or move abroad,” Kalousek warned.
The member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of a survey between CK member states did not agree.
“Stop giving us lobbying insurance companies,” he said.
The statement by the insurance companies does not consider Okamura relevant, nor does there exist any official written expression in that sense.
They say they will find out if the travel agencies will be involved, which Okamura says is no problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of a competitive association of travel agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies, warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” Fischer said.
Her proposal to release the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Nor did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) come with a proposal to return the template to the committee due to an alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Philip pointed out that travel agencies could threaten consumers.
The rapporteur, Martina Berdych (ANO), has withdrawn her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum of four million insurance limits for travel agencies offering air travel tours, and a million limit for offices selling bus tours, for example.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the limit of insurance performance will have to be such that, in the event of a decline, the travel agency will cover all customer claims.
Even after the adjustments, travel agencies will have to re-instate which travel agency organizes the trip for the sold tours.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee shall also include further regular information on insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will need to provide them with information about the number of passengers and tours sold each month, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds out that the travel agency has failed to comply with any legal obligation to the insurance undertaking, it shall invite it, in accordance with the draft, to remedy it or be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
The amendment is also expected to redefine the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial spending plan and a two-year perspective.
According to the lawmaker, he did not think of what would happen if the insurance company ended the contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and the clients who bought the tour before the insurance was terminated, so they will lose it according to the association.
In this case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may also fail, even though its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such situations will be a claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and in our market we will only act as an agency, said the vice-president of the association Jan Pope.
Although the draft amendment also includes the banking guarantee institute, it is so unthinkably that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
According to the Association, the change in the current de facto practice is useless.
In the two-year period, due to the new EU directive, the whole law will need to be reworked again.
There are now 942 active insurance travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs ended.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about 20 billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be committed to improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced this after meeting with the German Prime Minister.
At the same time, it called again for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28-year-old member countries.
We need to help countries where refugees are leaving or where they are staying after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will bet on decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, that such a signal could also be higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
“The federal countries also support the German government to promote a fair distribution of the scale of the refugee crisis into European countries,” Merkel said.
Earth’s Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects true solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of runners in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been denied, among other things, by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke for speeding up asylum proceedings in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start the integration of foreigners faster, said the Prime Minister of Braribor.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of runners is used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will need to be able to handle German.
It is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if runners manage to integrate, they can be a benefit to us, he said.
Matt Damon Fails Diversity in the Movie
Matt Damon confronted Afro-Ametic filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, claiming that it was not necessary behind scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project, Greenlight interrupted the actor cast in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views about black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it by filming and not by filming the show,” Damon said.
Shocked, she reacted scandalously to Brown with distrust and sighed 'Hoo! Wow. Okay, when the comments about Martian got into the broadcast.
Damon and Brown teamed up with joint producer Ben Affleck and brothers Farrelly to discuss the finalists of the show.
“I would like to appeal to people to think, no matter who the director is, how they will behave to the character of Harmony,” Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that is a webbing that is packed with a white trap.
The producer of Dear White People promoted finalists Angelas and Kristin Brancaccio for the rights to direct a film; Damon has cut off that their directings could eventually give us something we don’t want to do.
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded in dissension with Damon’s commentary.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing a clip, “Matt Damon jumped into the language of a single black woman in the room, so she can explain to her that diversity is so white that it hurts.”
Tweet has gained more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was released.
Damon's comment comes when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national effect and pushed lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminating against colored people.
In February, the singer-songwriter Prince made hints at the movement, while featured nominated in the category Album of the Year during the Grammy Awards.
“The albums are still important,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Black Lives Matter’s latest leader presented a statement in response to Fox News’s personal question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love,” he said.
Damon was recently reported on a list of fungiers, producers and the media of Moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation, or has already met the Pope, is not clear.
American Ninja Warrior has the first winner.
The professional climber and pixel Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In the competition that just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all obstacles on the track.
During this season's final, two men fought to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30 second climb over more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to complete the climb at a set limit and became the first to win the American Ninja Warrior in 4 episodes, but Caldiero overcame him in 3 seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the news news! News immediately after his hard-to-learn victory, and it was known that he was still in shock of winning a major prize worth $1 million.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than 10,000 dollars a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
\"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it will be like now.
The executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter magazine on the course of the finale and why Britten won no reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor to complete the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to the one who finishes the track the fastest.
“If more competitors participate in the track, the winner will win the one with the best time,” said Weed.
Although winning the main win would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
“I don’t think he’d have any shame in himself.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has done.
He received a warm reception from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
For his children and his wife, he is a hero.
Geoff said to me, “If there was anyone who could have defeated me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season to begin filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers Just Walked Around Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season was not just a walk through a pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are at the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just narrowly reversed their defeat when they defeated Minesota in the game on Tuesday, with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field.
Twins have wasted their chance to approach the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of words to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
“To win is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” Brad Ausmus, Tiger Manager, said.
Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive arrival and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took on another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponents 6 1/3 hits and 3 rounds.
It was only his third best game of the last nine games.
“This year I want to end with convincing results,” Simon said.
\"It's hard to get into a game when you often sit on a bench and that's why I want to get into the game -
Victor Martinez was hit three times and made two rounds and his first point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last June game, in which he hit four times in a game against Seattle Mariners.
“He leaned in,” Ausmus said.
“He looked good at the training, he fired significantly better, and he managed to bring it to the match,” he said.
Thanks to three circulations at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins got the best chance to return to the game.
By means of two points on the left side of the playground, Byron Buxton won the shift.
True polarist Aaron Hicks earned a point thanks to the set baton and Simon hit Brian Dozier before he was replaced by Blaine Hardy.
Hardy threw out his only rival Mauer and had a batter, Miguel San, who fired the ball and ran two feet and left the right-wing Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the finishes and chances of drawing in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third metal over two meters.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two feet this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for Tigers.
However, this right hand cast Sano into three superstitiouss.
Detroit took advantage of the benefits and scored points when playing Phil Hughes.
The tigers gained three circulations in the first two shifts against a well-deserved right-winger who entered the game after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
“I definitely didn’t think of such a start,” Hughes said, “but during the third shift, I already felt that I was doing better.
After resisting the attack in the first shift, Hughes released one point to Ian Kinsler's second metare.
Two departures for the true polarist J.D. Martinez were carried out by Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Nick Castellanos' third metal followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was overwhelmed when he tried to reach the third level.
The Tigers added in the second shift when James McCann and the Anthony Gose polarizer won two points and then one point on the final score of 3-0.
“This has put us in our knees,” said duo manager Paul Molitor.
\"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place -
Hughes, who won the number of over-the-counters, finished in the third shift without points and was replaced by right-wing A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three feet, gained six launches and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the real Tigers' pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should start in a Wednesday match.
Sancheze will replace Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and take action against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was exchanged for David Price's left hand hand hand hand, he has a 1-1 score after 4 matches.
He hasn’t played since August 20th because of his muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play a third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
The Minnesota Left Overhailer Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will be built against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy into a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world to strengthen growth, said President Xi Jinping, whose task is to reform governance on Tuesday.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policy,” he said in a statement on the 16th meeting of the Central Head of the Group to deepen the overall reform.
The promotion of opening up in emerging reforms will add a new boost and vitality, also providing a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, the support of state enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programs.
This move is important because it will provide the market with a greater role in resource allocation, legal business environment provision and make the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In order to open a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a green card, thanks to the optimization of the requirements and simplification of the application process.
The provision of the rights of lawyers to practice and develop a professional judge and prosecutor has also been discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, a new bed department may be created.
According to the Deputy Director of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Mójek (ČSSD), the current capacity of the double departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to extend care in the region.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, the centers of one-day surgery could be created, where, according to the set concept, the performance of surgical disciplines, which do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours, could be carried out.
In which specific hospitals the workplace should be focused on day-to-day surgery is not yet clear.
In the skin department of the hospital Karlovy Vary, a laser center could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apal center that would take care of patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of focusing such a facility in the hospital Island, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, is the beds of subsequent care, especially the beds of Lečeben long-term ill (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdok is insufficient and should, above all, be closely attached to acute care beds.
Part of this device should work as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As he points out, beds of follow-up care are mainly missing in the hospital Karlovy Vary.
There could be used abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease are absent.
These beds are lacking in the whole republic, so they could serve other countries as the so-called Alzheimer’s.
Hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which European funding will be released.
“This is a bed that will follow up on the areas of advanced care and will create a room for translating patients after surgery, for example, after a cardiovascular, neurosurgical, transplant or other procedure,” describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
