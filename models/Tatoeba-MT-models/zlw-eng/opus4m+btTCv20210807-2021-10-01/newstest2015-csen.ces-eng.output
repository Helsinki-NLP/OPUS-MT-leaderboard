Petr Čech: Transfer to the Last Moment?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently a replacement goalkeeper of Chelsea, is not above the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel in laughter, speaks with Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech representation for the game general with Americans and then also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea’s new season, the Premier League prefers Thibaut Courtois, and the Czech Republic, for the first time in ten years, has become a substitute for the club in London.
A few years ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup at the beginning of the season in battle with Atlétik and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
In the French league season, he left with two wins and two draws, and on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
The AS Monaco bot club is the most effective.
He has a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far and broke up with Lille on weekend 1:1.
On the tabloids of English websites today, news has jumped that the Czech Republic might want to visit Queens Park Rangers.
However, according to English bookmakers, leaving Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet gave him a 4:1 course.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your shirt in the next few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Perhaps there will be an offer that will not be rejected during the day.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) - Well, I don't know what such an offer, which cannot be rejected, actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on Chelsea’s attitude to deal with the club or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer when you are in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new scene?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere at the representative meetings and certainly still a lot of transfers are closing today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing away?
The situation when I didn’t catch a new season in the first three games is new to me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue the fight for Chelsea’s goalkeeper and he’s up to the coach he chooses to make the decision over the coming weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sport is essential to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, which, of course, belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible that you can join another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never be about me.
But everything is possible in football.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.

George Webster accused of rape in Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
A man will be brought to trial because of charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was found guilty during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
On June 7, 2013, a woman was reportedly raped at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to the statement, Webster attacked her, while “she was not aware, slept, and was not in a state to give her consent.”
Webster is also prosecuted for rape by another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of recalculation at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on November 17.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law designed to protect trade unions as civil rights.
“As the unions work, middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, a Democratic Senator behind Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud that I can present, together with the model of occasional rights, John Lewis, a law strengthening the position of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to defend themselves from discrimination in trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-defence forces
Adjusting the Labour Relations Act to allow all workers who face discrimination, if they want to engage in trade unions, to judge the civil court - and to assess compensation or compensation - is an appropriate and necessary initiative.
This is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other lawmakers put forward in law is to reconnect to the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that took place in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states, Americans have once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand and respect labour rights.
There have been times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country with one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, including the language, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to gather, negotiate collectively and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, GeneralDwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in a new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly says: “The right to create societies that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek damage shall be repealed. Measures leading to the achievement of such purpose shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the appellants and Roosevelt's guarantee that \"everyone has the right to create and join trade unions in the protection of his interests.\"
All-generation Americans have accepted the basic premier that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize themselves in a free and open society and to promote themselves.
As Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions did not diminish the power of the nation, but they expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who challenge trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn’t forget, and we shouldn’t either.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The regulation, signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require abortion doctors to have the right to accept a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
A judge’s resolution means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, have to obtain this authorisation.
“The requesting party will be legally able to operate its activities and, in the meantime, it will obtain its permission,” states federal judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be planned within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to abortion of a resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from the sneaky law that is supposed to deprive them of their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which, on behalf of three of the five clinics, demanded the law to be blocked.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also concerns doctors from two clinics that were not among the defendants and also asked for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such a measure unconstitutional.
A key part of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked federal judges on Friday.
Women's rights fighters for abortion, together with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the need to have this permission puts on physicians requirements that are not medically necessary.
The protesters opposed the measures to protect women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that due to the measures, clinics would be closed.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one abortion physician was allowed in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for his safety, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities said they would not punish physicians who carry out abortions while waiting for them to process a request for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer is more likely to kill in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video of their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of five years after the diagnosis lived.
Susan Jordan, head of research at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
Small study: New medicines can slow lung and ovaries cancer
Researchers followed women in seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says the factors could be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gynecooncologists who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
A research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer today will be published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Elisha Neave’s young mother, Gold Coast, was diagnosed with aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could result in today’s young generation of consumers reaching “the main age group of gardeners, garden centers going up to £10 million a year.”
According to the report, people who rent their homes spend an average of 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own gardens.
As other factors threatening the sector, which earns an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of pre-gardens used as a parking area and the decreasing size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homes owned fell from 61% to 43% in six years, the lowest spending on gardening products in the UK is one household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Company said that living in a sub-lease or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s chief gardening advisor, said: “For tenants, there is a very popular planting in flower pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them -
The HTA report revealed that “the golden age of the garden retail sector was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at the gathering of his youth organization, which most closely reminds me of Hitlerjugend, saved with atomic weapons, and basically gave everyone the message that their views were stolen from him, he gave us today a lecture about democracy.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can control both nationalism and that the complex of inferiority can transform them into imperialistic delicacies.
Time in the East seems to be different from that of the West.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long gone, in the East it thought that they had been overlooked for a long time and it was necessary to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the power of the Nazis was seized and then followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike the present situation in Russia.
And then the totally identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the destruction of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians are missing after Russia ruled half the world and the second part was shaking before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians were guilty of it themselves, perhaps little Vladimir was crying around his shoulder, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted him, and maybe they started underestimating him, and he was just acting like a typical Russian man.
He made his way home, pretended he didn't even want to go anywhere and brushed knives at home.
Now he decided to go back to the lost position.
He starts slowly, he has time.
The leader is probably alive, so where would he hurry?
He sent the Caucasus, now he's going to trample the Ukrainians, then there's the Dwarfs from the Baltics.
You've been scratching a Russian bear in the fur for a long time.
China will also notice this, which is going to jump a lot, and it certainly makes a long way to the Far East.
And those Germans of that Vladimir were also pretty upset about how well they were doing, and I gave them that in 45 so much on their ass.
How about making one new Novorosia in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base, and there are many of ours, and as they oppress them, they have already wanted to destroy many of them.
So far, our veterans will remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
For their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he is so soft, he can be peeled like onions, and I eat all of their EU.
That would be a game for the Russians to jump on.
They need to remember where their place is.
And we're going to use our soukmen to live in their territory.
There's plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed there, they're just being oppressed, and we're not going to let them go, we're going to protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what else is born.
Europe is good only as a foreword, on which proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey calls U.S. diplomat for espionage report
Turkey’s foreign minister has called the country’s top-ranked U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the U.S. National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major states are watching each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, has triggered a more outraged response by the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones introduced other tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted of how the tricks of the fourth series came into being.
The most visible are the computer editing of the serial environment and the mass scene, when from the depths of the soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the city hall in the Calvia self-government area.
Police director Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of entrepreneurs and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magalufu.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballen, a street in which most of the bars and night businesses in Magaluf.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the prosecutors of the Mallorese Office for the Fighting of Corruption provided evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia self-governing area.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police because of the connection with the corruption charge and together with Navarre will be heard by the judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC cited dissatisfied owners of nighttime enterprises, according to which the advantages of public officials have serious impacts on their business.
“It’s not about making money for a long time, it’s about survival,” one entrepreneur said in court.
Don't play with our living.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got to the main websites of magazines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube by an 18-year-old British tourist who provided oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee drunks and breakers in a range of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours around bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where there was an event with the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with tour operators at Carnage’s bars to pay a fine of 55,000 euros (73,000 dollars).
The Magaluf Tourist Resort, which is popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol accidents, including fashionable waves known as “balconing”, where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first spring day was marked by rains and storms that had an impact on flights at Adelaide Airport.
JARO brought South Australia an ice surprise, it came with strong rain and a sharp wind that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of rainfall in the city is due to fall up to nine hours in the evening and another 6.6 mm in the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced along with a few short storm- and gust of wind, which started eight o’clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought about almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After a few early spring doses last week, the city’s temperatures fell to just 15.8 °C again on Monday.
It is believed that storm weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land at 19:30, but at short distance it was affected by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to delay landing.
The winds at Adelaide Airport were about 50 km/h on the ground at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to drop off from the second landing and eventually arrived at about 20:40.
The aircraft was subsequently delayed by further flights, including the flight from Dubai to Emirates and the flight from Sydney to Qantas.
According to the forecast, temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two excesses may appear.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after they spent the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes with rockets and minometers. However, the schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from fighting.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, the city in the south of the country, the staff of the kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed remains from the wall from the shells and slowly await the return of children.
“We’re a little scared, but otherwise we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area need to go back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said: “It’s a bit strange to go to school all of a sudden.
“We’ve been through a few hard moments and we haven’t left the house at all,” she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or their homes and set off to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and minometers.
Many Nachal Oz residents, a village near the border with Gaza, in which the Palestinian Minomet shot killed a four-year-old boy, with a return weight.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in spare schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Sderot School, a city on the Gaza border that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study carefully, adding: “We will provide you with education and safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to a timeless peace.
The ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, but did not solve key problems such as Hamas's request to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re-opening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
The new round of indirect negotiations is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has questioned these figures and estimated that at least half of the killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other Gazan radicals fired 4,591 missiles and Minomet missiles during fighting against Israeli cities in the south of the country.
The Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have been hiding in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who remain in hiding, school officials have postponed the beginning of the school year due to ongoing struggles last week.
“I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete education just like Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old school boy in Gaza’s largest city.
I'm standing behind you.
And Lafatu is suffering from temperature
The Czech Football team met in Prague before Wednesday’s preparatory match with the US and the opening match for the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the twenty-two-member cadre, the Spartan attacker David Lafata has problems with temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David's still got a little bit of problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible,” said coach Pavel Vrba to reporters.
“If it’s two or three days, or it’s going to be fit tomorrow, it’s going to be seen according to his health condition, which our doctor will decide.”
The other players are fine.
“Of course, someone has some kind of pain, but it’s not that they can’t train or take part in a match Wednesday with the US,” the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vach.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, other central polarists also seemed to consider.
I decided on the basis that Luke is a prospective player, who is 25 years old.
The decision-making was very difficult, but I am behind it,” Vrba said.
What about Sural?
We'll see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that, in the case of health problems, nominations could still change.
On the weekend with great performance, for example, the Liberian Josef Šural, who gave the hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown the form.
We'll see how David Lafata is doing.
In the event that it cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not say that I can not donominating one of the players who were interested in the Czech League,” Vrba said.
This afternoon, there is a presentation of training on Strahov, and on Tuesday a classic pre-game training before duel with the USA on the Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The meeting with the Americans takes place on Wednesday from 20:15, and the national team in it will seek the premiere victory under Vrbou.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualifying struggle with the Netherlands is then on the 9th of September from 20:45.
Pešice goes to the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba is pleased to have more time for training than previous meetings.
There is an advantage when you have a player for eight days and you can practice certain things with them, for which we have not had so much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing ourselves as best as possible for the Netherlands,” Vrba praised.
The Dutch will present themselves before the game in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will be personally monitored by the former temporary representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us information about what the game is.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a match and we're going to have to discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there,” said Vrba to bronze medalists from the recent World Championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the price of apartments in the winter period has increased the most over the last seven years.
According to the index of housing values in the Australian capital of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9%, more than doubled in one year by August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said he is leading Sydney and Melbourne on the market.
The figures of RP Data show that the prices of apartments in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while prices in Melbourne were 11.7%.
Other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other hand, the scale was placed by Canberra, which was damaged by the State ordered to reduce expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the continuing high level of auction sales, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months,” he said.
Jenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said to me, \"I love you -
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a cooler relationship.
Henry is trying a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother’s death, Henry went through “a thorough therapy and now he’s thinking about his relationship with his father.”
He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice: \"Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seychelles and Hilton - when I was a child, they were already adults - went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass with a beer or the beauty of a punch in a scream.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father’s time, he looked at what life had to be like for him.
Today there's a little more light, but it's still dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth, where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always walked into the bath and lay there, then it was heard how he slowly began to sing for himself, because of himself he was washing the foundry.
When I went around, I realized that he had been doing this years to feed his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
However, Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
No one hugged anyone, he didn't say, \"I love you.\"
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started to say, \"I love you, I love you, I love you.\"
His daughter Billie, whom he had with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
You can stop saying, \"I love you.\"
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French, with whom he was married for 25 years, they are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes began to manifest, the doctor said to me, \"You have to make a radical change -
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tired.
No one wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of wearing Henry’s career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othello, he dived into the theatre.
It was followed by a Comedy full of errors and the Fences of August Wilson.
It is a different experience than sitcoms and comedy that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage as he parods someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For a long time, I was the only black imitator/comic on television.
He was learning on the march.
Besides having to notice me to the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to invent functioning jokes, be a star and perform on TV, and that was really hard.

Since his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed up as blacks, Henry and his comedy eventually performed for five years.
My family was no longer interested in it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “the year and years the main product of British television,” but it was also “the grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Jenny Henry Show began in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among other things as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For the next decade, he was taken up by advertisements, documents, TV shows and roles in movies, but after the broadcast of his television series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said, “What are you going to do now, Lene, it seems a little bit like you’re stuck in one place or you’re leaving the road a little?”
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we talked to on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lesser, Judi Dench, said, “You should try.”
Don't get into it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines of Othell's final speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me courage.
“It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard, and I've read the game before for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
He soon started playing in Comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, \"You've changed --
There was a technical defect and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the audience.
“A voice in my head said to me, ‘Before he makes a computer, you have to have ten minutes of fun.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage, and something in me said, \"Oh, thank God.\"
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
“You’re playing, so stay in a role.”
Henry at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the fences was a challenge.
The panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it’s like God’s sign saying, “This is what you should do.”
Of course, he says it with a special voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm glad to see you in the test room.
Henry, however, remains a comedy's brain - all the time, our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and comes out of the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
When you're always looking for something, you can get into the dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't like it any more.
I asked if he'd ever arrange a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps give outlines to the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to light up to non-existent employees
Kenya began the biometric registration of all its civil servants in order to try to remove non-existent employees from the government’s pay list.
According to the government’s statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will not be paid out.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid after leaving the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state per month is losing at least one million dollars ($700 000) on the paydays of non-existent employees and further abuse of official power.
The government is suspected that salaries are still deposited on bank accounts after the death of an employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, according to a BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must arrive in the identification centers where their data will be biometrically recorded within the next two weeks, the government’s statement states.
Furthermore, he says that anyone who does not appear without sufficient apology will be excluded from the paycheck.
“With the intention of real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to clear the pay list at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, the Ministry of Development and Planning’s secret.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for “conspiracy” against the government
Local media reports that in Turkey, 33 police officers were arrested for suspicion of “conspiracy against the government.”
The police have not commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking officials arrested.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and phone surveillance.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time Prime Minister) called their actions a part of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen’s action against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine were reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister of Arseny Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters that not all schools were re-opened, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
All Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a school teacher in Slavjansk, attended by Jaceňuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidery shirts, bringing balloons and giving teachers flowers.
The BBC may have found a heavy-time boss in the Rona Fairhead.
It carries with it the cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience from the front lines.
She began her career at Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She resigned for seven years when her younger colleague, Pearson's, took up the highest position in her parent company.
It is said that her severance was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, former BP director, when Cameron needed a private expertise in Whitehall: she became a government adviser.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a poison cup.
Not only is the BBC a large and complex entity in the centre of public life, but there is also an inner paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also outside the public’s voice in times of unrest when things don’t work.
This is a nearly unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
Which director, however, would risk coming to a company that is complex like the Chinese dynasty, will break it down and thereby deprive themselves of their work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn’t that hard, many people would like to see the BBC shrinking - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
As the circle of competition expands and the new technology challenges old security, it carries with it immediate negotiations on the concession fees for the BBC a great danger.
For a modest amount of £145.5 a year, the British public buys a share of something that is certainly the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, and each costs only 40 cents a day.
In addition, the popularity of the BBC appears to increase: to 53% of the supporters versus 31% a decade ago.
Models of use of the BBC services have changed: Today, newspaper headlines appear on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can look at the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and amazing institution.
He needs an amazing director - I hope he found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve of the offensive tweet
The tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account, which was released on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
A tweet came out of my account that was not authorized.
“I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it,” he said in his next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet was posted by the distasteful, humorous picture of state prosecutor Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 of driving drunk.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, which made Perry, a possible candidate for the 2016 election president, brought this month before a large jury in Austin.
“I don’t always drive three times higher levels of alcohol in my blood than the limit is allowed... but if so, I’m suing Governor Perry for calling me responsible.”
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to reject the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped paying $7.5 million from the State Fund for Public Interest Defense, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuted for corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's famous.
After finishing fifth in a committee of his party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry replied to speculation that he could end up tweeting with his own photo running near the lake, saying, \"Here I am, South Carolina.\"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is “turning back to normal”
One of London’s most prominent development companies warned that the housing market had “returned” to normal levels of activity in southeastern England.
Residing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about the credit bubble caused the Bank of England to impose mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s demanding client development company, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from its top point in 2013 to its normal level of transaction, adding that it provides a “stable environment for functioning”
The London housing market was successful during the fall, as buyers from abroad flooded into the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, prices in the city only jumped by 18.5% last year, far above the average of 6.7% in England and all over Wales.
The average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and rose to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pounds, London real estate buyers have not been so attractive in recent months - some of them have also intimidated the introduction of new real estate taxes and talks about possible \"sitting tax\" with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections next May.
London’s Foxtons real estate agency warned last week that a April review of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent loan rules, will slow down market growth in both real estate and price sales during the second half of the year.
The new Bank of England data showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages per month in July, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its house prices to 3% on the basis of the fact that home prices have already begun to fall.
Meanwhile, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, was reduced by a quarter each year.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing as it increased cash for forward sale to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same, and thus the forward sale continued to be -
In June, the company announced that from the beginning of the year until the end of April it sold 3,742 properties, almost a third more than before the 2007 crisis.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, revenue by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual Pidgley meeting, he said Berkeley’s annual revenue would be expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before taxation will be £450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker on the Internet Releases Photos of Nude Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar owner Jennifer Lawrence's photos leaked online because of a hacker who claimed to have \"a list - a photo of hundreds of start-up actresses.
“Hunger Games” spokesperson confirmed Lawrence’s photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for “obvious privacy violations”
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who has stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker photos that were originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, reportedly obtained due to a gap in Apple iCloud’s Internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of the victims hacked by BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It’s unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world - Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who are looking at the photos we took with your husband years ago in private home are happy with each other,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for her series of cable television, Nicolodeon \"iCarly\" and \"Victorious\", denied that the photos were true. On Twitter, she said, \"These alleged naked photos of me are the Podvrh, people -
It's better to cut it off even in despair. *intentional vocabulary*.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that the spokesperson of the pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary example of Howard Jacobson’s praised new novel about love and the letter “J”
They dissolved, this is the best way to describe it, they gradually spread out like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, sharp, isolated, and maybe a little uglier.
And then she shook his hand.
He admits it.
He knew how to stick like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was the beginning of a love thing that more than usual promised to relieve him of lonely life boredom and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild heat of hair and a flying heart from a village on a northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south came an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, appropriately, the Paradise Valley.
No one has lived in the house for years.
The pipes were sown, there were spiders dead in the baths, the slimemen signed on the windows, as if they thought that place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and weeds resembled the huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel \"J\" is on the pre-list of Man Booker Prize 2014 nominations.
A closer selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and held their hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, unpretentiously tuned up the public station, which the county provided comforting music and calming news, while looking at her sunken cross-legs reminded him of an old song long forgotten black comic, whom his father liked to listen to the blind blinds.
You have too many legs.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They were not forbidden - nothing was actually forbidden - they simply did not play.
They helped them get into desuetuda, as well as the word desuetuda itself.
People’s taste has proved what they would never be able to do with regulations and positions outside the law, and, like people in terms of books, they choose memoirs in which the poor person becomes rich, cooks and love novels, so ballads are chosen in music.
Kavern let himself be cut off and began playing an imaginary piano and a thick, comic voice sang the Serenade to Aillini's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
“It was a popular song by jazz pianist Fats Waller,” he said, automatically attaching two fingers to his lips.
His father always did this when he wanted to suppress the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was still young.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of the kiss, it cost you a penny.
It wasn’t funny at the time, and it wasn’t funny right now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard.
Not even jazz, although it was not directly built outside the law, did they play.
Improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one place in life, if only
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she would end up.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability went to people's nerves.
Jazz was the humor of the song.
Even though he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior until ten years ago, Kevern knew about his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least he didn't have to say that Fats Waller was a black man.
Because of her age, she couldn’t remember a time when favorite singers weren’t crazy.
Also without law or pressure.
A slow society is one in which every part of it with gratitude - with gratitude to those who have been happily saved - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution threw for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if they were a natural electronics gift, took responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were installers, the Greeks, what remained, washed dishes.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, while what had happened had happened, had they been afraid to blame them for putting them into the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would spend them next time - they opened up a restaurant where labneh was sold and water pipes were smoking, they did not draw attention to themselves, and the inaction was slowly eating them.
Everyone according to their talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn hardly understood how music could have been created from the stupid words that Kavern had just sung to her.
Music was an expression of love.
“In fact, they’re not stupid,” Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too many legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too, but the neglected garden gave the illusions of security.
From behind the soundproofs, no word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
“He seemed funny,” he finally said.
She shook her head unbelievably and obscured Kever’s view.
In the whole wide world, nothing but the confusion of her raven hair was seen.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“If you think,” she said doubtfully.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing to me.
She looked really angry.
Do I have too many legs?
He looked again.
She was walking so far.
Maybe some ankles...
You say you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
You understand?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said to her, “I love you, but it was too early.
“Your fat ankles are attracting me right now,” he tried.
I'm kind of obscene.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to shorten the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel, Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons got out of the bed, dropped the radio and spilled the undrinked wine.
Wineless, so drinking couldn't do it.
She seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in a storm.
“I’m so sick that you’re a fool,” she said.
Except it doesn't attract me.
She felt sorry for both her unkind words and the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
She thought she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that in the basics it was the same as here.
It was the same wide and icy ocean.
The same perplexed men, after what had stopped, even more invigorated and frozen than their ancestors, traffickers, and persecutors, were angry at the pub to the pub, ready to extend their hand to any woman who would dare to refuse or laugh at them.
You're kidding me?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First, anointing her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibodies of the feeble balad about love, which the radio smelted - first anointed her, then murder her one.
In Kever’s opinion, too much cultivation, because petting itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got out of the bed like an old man.
She felt dissatisfied, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave, as if she were watching him out of the window on the floor, the man she had caught up with what she had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart smothered for him and for all men in general, regardless of the fact that a few beat her.
The man turned away from her, the arms of the shrewd, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment, until today, that she'd ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, herself again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic twenty-five-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statistic public mood monitoring system, has prepared a short article on the survival of light and moderately violent acts in areas where its mitigation or direct stopping was most expected if enough money and energy were spent on its removal.
“A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done,” she wrote, “so that the innate aggression of the people who fought in many battles and most of them won, especially in the congested, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tips of the church towers rising above the hedges of the breath of human kindness has historically appeared rarely,” she said.
However, some things are irreplaceable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the boxes.
Residents sigh over the sentimental ballads, swallow unhappy stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in the piping areas old brutality holds as hard as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance appears at home, in the workplace, roads and even in sports fields.
“Unfortunately, you tend to have too much style,” said her superior.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t have to answer that,” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again held her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I’m not asking,” Rabbinovitz said, “that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unconnected companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is totally acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are preconceived to the Church - things you call \"brute\" and \"brute\" - others could also interpret as expressions of natural power and energy.
It would have happened if it had happened, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, it was preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
His head was on a pink lightboard, and he had a recommendation that From had been sending to the world for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than silence, the sung word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
“I totally understand your reservations,” answered Esme Nussbaum quietly, when she was sure her superior was over, “and I’m no longer saying that the wound didn’t heal the way we’re saying she was healed.
My concern, above all, is that if we are not warned of this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened before it happened.
This time, however, we will not ventilate our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
That meant infinite patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when the steps you may have taken and perhaps didn’t make your grandparents, you describe them as mistakes.
You also go too far to talk about ventilating your “relationship” and “faithfulness” to “others”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting the presence we are not talking about “us” and “they”
There was no “we” and there were no “they”
All we know is that it was chaotic times.
“In which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “we are no one without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to say about it - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault that could be brought to anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past than to learn from it -
The past exists to forget it.
If I can add something to it -
Luther Rabinowitz split the fingertips.
“I’ll take your message into account,” he said and released it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who ran on the trail in a way that was described by passers-by as “brute and angry”
Accidents happen.
The Army of the Kingdom of Lesoth claims that no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesoth denied to hold a coup in order to overthrow the government, and claimed to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
After saying he was threatened by death, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighboring South Africa.
Major Ntle Ntoi, a spokesperson for the army, said it was not actually a coup, but an army response to the threat of \"political fanatics\" that the police tried to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defence forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several news reports of the information service that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make a trigger in the country,” he said.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one has declared that he has seized government power by force, they seem to bear the action of the forest defense forces a sign of a state coup,” he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesoth said the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday, and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the session of parliament due to internal disputes, there is tension in Lesoth.
He declared that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions to the government.
Eurozone production is at a 13-month low
Production growth slowed to a 13-month minimum in August in the euro area, according to a closely monitored survey.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell in August to 50.7.
A number greater than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders have been lost and the factories have damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia because of Ukraine.
The figures come from the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting Thursday.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating to 0.3%.
There have been speculations that ECB director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering the quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States have approached during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect, which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty at the manufacturer, is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s chief economist.
The production PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to 11 months minimum 51.4.
In the second largest economic zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France is concerned, Italy has again moved from the expansion of the stagnation.
Signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not too calming,” Dobson said.
Deceleration of industry is likely to add oil to the fire to analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the production review of purchasing managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing,” he said.
He added: “The manufacturers in the euro area currently have a very complex life, because the increasing geopolitical tensions, especially between Russia and Ukraine, add even more uncertainty to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has been demonstrably impacted - especially by consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially costly ones.
He said, “It seems even more likely that the ECB will eventually have to do some form of quantitative easing,” he said, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten Years of Hell of Residents from Beslan: Ten Years of Horrors From the busy school, Children Still Suffer
Ten years ago, the Chechen radicals at Beslan School in southern Russia were held hostage by thousands of people.
During a three-day suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
Ten years after the horrific occupation of Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, at the beginning of the new school year on September 1, 2004, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to tragedy brought the East and the West together, which in this disastrous disaster led to action and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities of the school.
We found amazing young people who resisted the unhappiness, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
The war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them were dying - is over.
Girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as she tries to get back into a bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in her underwear.
The confused Aida desperately sought her mother Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
I had my legs from my blood.
I got up and came back to find my mother.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had been fully healed, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
There were pieces of straps left in my knee.
Its goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it definitely didn’t destroy it,” she said determinedly.
“It just happened to me and that can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to friends about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate, Jare Gapev, were killed there.
As a child, we played together and imagined how we were going to go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she did not forget the captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we got from Britain and other countries.
When I look on the internet at my picture as I climb through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster, and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rain of a bullet and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At that time, he said, “Mama told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, “Go away.”
He feared that he was dead, ran away and saw a crying toddler on the way, took the child by the hand and ran through the shower of the bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother was dead.”
He said, “I couldn’t save her.
In fact, Tamara was free and lying in a hospital with her leg injured, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the missing News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
“The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are already pale.
I remember that right after that I threw away all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with it.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they've been killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store, and how I drove a cabriolet.
But now he fears about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffer the same way because of the war.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror,” says Damir, who took part in volunteering in the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children out there who were screaming and running, and it took a few months to keep quiet.
He remembers his trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even if it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's appetite for the borsch, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters at the restaurant, shooting Damir at them from a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And that was just a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world has not changed for the better in the last ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children will be killed and killed.
They are the same children as ours.
For many people, war is only something in the news that they listen to when they get bored or do something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet boy, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn’t want revenge, he doesn’t care.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time he goes to the gym and lights candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on a couch with a face turned away from us and sometimes lying down for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had his eyes open.
I also remember that he fired all his guns or other weapons to play.
I can hardly believe I was sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I got up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies all over the place.
I was pretty sure my boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced I didn’t hear.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photograph after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Comfort: Residents of Beslan Grigory Ilyin with their mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, to the right of Grigory today
When he fled his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was put in his bloodthirsty face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, took him to school on his first day and hurried to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my boy stayed there for three days alone,” she said.
Not alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think about it and talk about it.
It will not be a day to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
The ever-returning memories: The photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was forever seen as a statue (right)
I remember the day Grigory was looking forward to school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he was alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there is even a statue of Grigory crying.
Grigorij doesn't like to look at the photo, and we've got it hidden in the library at home.
I understand it, but I also think that through this picture, people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigorij says: “It is important that this is not repeated again.
“I doubt we’ll ever find out the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something too bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?”
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget at least a little bit, it takes decades.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years ago I had a nightmare attack, but then it improved.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were killed.
When I get closer to September 1st, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladimirz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived even though he was held by a murderous terrorist
The Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but managed to survive.
When the attack was in full swing, he was captured in a gym, sitting next to the bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
“It seems to us as if it were yesterday,” Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, said, “but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw behind my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that kids can do better with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006 I went to a psychologist and then I was a little better off, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year nato - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go back there again and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in this well-known picture.
Survived: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken at the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm okay.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But I still couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they answered me that it was impossible.
My other favorite is animals, so I got on the vet.
I finished the second year there.
Learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It’s not something children should know about and not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
It's inside and it's getting worse with the anniversary approaching.
I'll take part in the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there unlike me.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God for bringing him back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's a grown-up today, but he's carrying on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so unfairly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say that 50% of them have already overcome the horror, but they can't overcome it completely and they can't forget.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and the pain only worsens.
I lost a lot of people I liked and loved.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God can give me, but I am hurt by the loss of the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who did not get married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were a friendly country, so how did we get to fighting together now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away - as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who brought a special officer to safety
Rescued: Alyon Tskaev is carrying a special commander (left) to a safe Russian.
She is now 10 (right) and does not remember the tragedy.
In 2004, the world caught its breath when a small Alyon brought a Russian police officer out of Beslan captive arms.
The terrorists released her, but they kept her 30-year-old mother, a ten-year-old sister, Kristina and brother Makhar in prison.
Makhar, who was three years old at that time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and her new wife, Lightlana, had a girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all and has grown out of it a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said that “it’s a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to take better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, there is a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family celebration of several cameras, they all cost less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera depending on what type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes the exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do that, find out how deeply you can immerse yourself with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in both conventional and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with the composition of photos, but outdoors don’t have it.
Even if you have an LCD, under water will be poorly seen and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
Always take more pictures.
If the camera has a braketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different dispersion exposure, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper immersion of light, it decreases significantly.
If possible, stay in the pool, lake or sea close to the surface.
This will also allow you to capture more light in photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is great advice if you take pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the more subdued light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill in a photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose personality power was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve patients from pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that mutilated him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
“I don’t feel in my skin,” he wrote in May of that year.
I felt free of energy.
He faced the symptoms of the flu and found out that he was impatience and that his wife, Juliet, included deplorescences.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and unexplainedly upset.
Something was wrong.
A friend made him an X-ray of his chest.
One week earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The results of X-ray came.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the plenum or if the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what their cause was.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
The mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of asbestos exposure - a building fibrous material that was previously referred to as \"miracle\" - but today it is known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore mesothelioms.
Asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in the industry entered into force.
Even at a time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as treasurers of insulation, builders, tessars and workers in the yard.
The toxins used in the industry in another era can hardly appear to be a cause for concern today.
Such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, there is a mesothelioma epidemic in Britain today.
The number of mesothelioma deaths is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice as many as the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually lasts several decades before the mesothelioma develops.
A disaster in the form of a mesothelioma does not concern only the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we shop.
Mesothelius therefore does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged bastions from London’s department stores to public schools do not constitute shelter.
Even Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage sites of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even consider isolation.
He tried to figure out where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was able to answer in part.
\"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who were then shown mesothelioma in the past five years,\" he said in a letter in 2010, \"I'm the only one still alive.\"
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not usual for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now, we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us get the same disease”
According to a leading British mesothelial expert, Professor Julian Pet, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at files from the archives of courts, which the disabled often turn to and require settlement, it shows how much the Mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June admitted to Marks & Spencer that she had exposed asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was a flagship company, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, she has two children, over twenty.
“Before it happened,” she says, “I’ve never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never even thought in a dream that he might be referring to me.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
His name was given thanks to his fibrosic structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often in buildings today it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, but the EU and WHO consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of an unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].”
Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of the mesothelioma, but Julian Pet’s work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient studies claim that “a substantial part of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely due to exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is due to “normal use and weathering” of buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not know they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that service lifts and pipelines behind the Parliamentary Committee’s rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be violated by something as harmless as “a strong air flow”
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case it may be the opposite of the truth.
Although the Parliament’s service department insisted that the Palace of Westminster should be given a “precious medical certificate”, it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to look closely at Parliament, modernize electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 elections, MEPs will rather than sit in Westminster’s green benches at Queen Elizabeth II’s Conference Centre.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations.”
It is not possible to say whether this nonconformity will cost lives.
Everyone can only wait now.
One person who has never been able to determine when their asbestos exposure occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven,” she says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something like a cold.
He was 45 and was in the middle of the operation.
Suddenly I was shaking.
It came at once.
I was so scared.
I thought I wasn't going home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming out of the puddle, the lining around the lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He eventually spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made him an X-ray of the chest and introduced his chest to remove the fluid they sent for analysis from his lungs.
However, they did not establish a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms came back, often after he practiced and sighed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he got in direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped probe was introduced to the space between the ventilator of the chest cavity and the ventilator of the lungs.
I'm an optimist.
“I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, she was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: \"They told me it was a mesothelioma -
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with Mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with his sisters from Macmillan, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“Asbestos have been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline,” he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest itself.
Mesothelioma is now starting to involve younger people who do not have a risk profession.
The most dangerous heat-insulated pipes in the hospital were located in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be at risk.
However, members of the staff who walked the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it turns out, decades after the hospital war, they were a place where patients could save lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is being removed today.
The students built Bunsen Kahan on asbestos pads.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulation and non-combustible properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
In countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
Websites dealing with asbestos in schools have been created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roof shelters on tools in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos, on which a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember, in the 1970s, when she fell into a garden house.
So watch out for the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
“It takes you a while,” Graham Abbott said.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I can't focus on what I'm doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he also remembered how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand everything,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told 12 months.
I remember saying, “Well, I’m not going to live another Christmas.
That's what--
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the mechanism itself of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills us.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos are small fibers.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers inhale, they can settle in the puddler, the puddler of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and is paradoxically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the tissues of the lungs, says Treasure, and “the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
Its nature has been invasive from the very beginning.
The mesothelioma common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is debated.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
“You can’t get rid of the mess,” he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “doesn’t respond too much to chemotherapy, which “has some effect,” but doesn’t cure.
“Sometimes there will be someone who will survive lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But eventually everyone will die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding out the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and advisor to equally affected people.
When they called, he appeared cheerfully: “Good day, you’ve reached the center of cancer.
“He was very positive,” Abbott said.
The disease was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “manifested things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request and have to approve the payment.
In order to get to the best available treatment, money is crucial for mesothelioma patients.
But when different treatments eventually fail, many patients face another financial concern - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but Morgan said it wasn't a \"full-fledged settlement\" because Lawson couldn't prove that mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, Guy's Hospital spokesperson confirmed that \"asbestos in the incriminated basement section was removed in the 1990s -
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To expose mortal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces have changed the owner or collapsed.
The insurance record is lost.
And those who are now defending themselves have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been adopted this year, making it easier for mesothelioma patients to seek a settlement, even if their former employer cannot be monitored.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve for insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos, but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally assign them as a settlement - approximately £120,000.
300 successfully completed applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks £350 million is “good work.”
“It’s an agreement signed by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out, pointing out, “that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they didn’t hit the time and people with mesothelioma would be able to reach out to the former employer and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that due to seven deaths each year it was necessary to act quickly.
“People are suffering too much and need help right away,” Penning said in December last year during a second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation he thought had a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
The operation was followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast survival rates of up to 5 years in up to 40% of patients.
Abbotta has made it stronger.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Check-ins showed no signs of the disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
I had several spots in my chest.
My 50th birthday was just approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
It's taking him.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of cancer in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security, when I die, or about showing a woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for Father Ellis (16) and Tamsin (14), this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellis was more obstinate.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients face such conversations.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not relaxed by hope or just a sign of a chance of survival.
The disease brings (and eventually brought to Stephen Jay Gould) unhappily certainty.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the growing debate on democratic reform, the Chinese parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to appoint candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this move will trigger long-proclaimed protests in the business district of Hong Kong, as activists began organizing and preparing only a few hours after this announcement.
China’s People’s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to disembark any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it upset us,” said legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we have to do with the authoritative regime.
To defend the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the Li Fei National People's Congress said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause \"chaos.\"
Since Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing has promised that citizens will be able to vote for executive power starting in 2017.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough, as Hong Kong allows for a direct vote, but also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold the committee’s nomination process firmly in hand, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in a few years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are held by the Occupying Central movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupying in the Rain movement gathered in front of Hong Kong’s headquarters.
In a demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks they would launch a wave of protests.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In a statement, the organizers said the move “was considering the occupation of the Central only as a final step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and no other choice left.
We must regret to announce that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted, and that the Central's occupation is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days to announce Beijing, and on Sunday they have strengthened the protection of government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Incitement of unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The tide of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupying Movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - a Hong Kong lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much more economic damage, depending on how many people participate and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a politician who criticizes the movement for a long time.
We don’t want to see the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
Chinese state media has also come up with reports in recent days that democratic activists in Hong Kong portray as Western-controlled subversive agents.
In the summer, the activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780 000 participants - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
The election agitiate?
The league in Jihlava bears the name of the political movement
The small kick is played in the county town of Vysočina by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is now called Together for the Jihlava League.
It was named after one of the local elections in October.
Another ten for his candidate is the boss of a small kick in Jihlava Jan Mrák.
“There was a general meeting where there was no problem,” Mrák said.
The situation around the first league of small excavators was already dealt with by lawyers of the Jihlavan town hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
Last year, the small mine gained around a million crowns according to the city’s website.
This year it is a hundred thousand.
In the legal opinion, the small procedure is not in conflict with the law or the directives of the Magistrate.
The situation, however, is an incentive for the Office to modify the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies,” said the spokesperson for the magistrate Radek Tulis.
Taking subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing as a small kickback in the elections of one political party, it may not be possible.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the highlands-big-footed football.
That the ČSSD region recruit, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1 would be created.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for.
On the contrary, I would like our sponsors from a number of companies to contact us,” said Miroslav Vrzáček, Chairman of the Regional Football Association.
The head of the small football party of another party and the movement will not allow into the name of the league
According to players, a small kick would deserve this sport in Jihlava with its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
“For example, the Na Stoupy playground is not ours, we are there for rent,” said Andrew Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava Club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be, for example, an inconvenient area for skaters, which is about 50 in Jihlava,” Mrák said.
The mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymil (ODS) responded that a small kicker used a field with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupy, which are owned by the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We plan to modernize or build sports grounds at schools that will be available in the afternoon.
“I think he’s made huge progress for a little kick in the last few years,” he added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear according to Jan Mráky.
We have restrictions.
If one of the fields enters into partnership with us, we no longer put another in the field,” he explained.
“The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step,” said Karel Voldan, a member of the City Hall Commission for Sport.
“But whether voters will assess whether Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mrak’s use of the company Malá Kopáná Jihlava and the city’s subsidies for political purposes or not,” he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - the first to fly jets
We are pleased that we can respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that the service also has a security page.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the whole state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury with our VIF (very important freshman) variants this year.
The company’s spokesperson said that since the services have just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks,” he said.
The company also stated that although students pay an annual fee of 9,000 pounds, it expects that the service will find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who enter the university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they throw thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The present waiting for a funeral with their hands up chanting: \"Hands up, don't shoot -
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, a blogger, Miriam Zoila Perez, reported a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when reproductive rights and income equality are enforced, white feminists prefer the race.
With increasing tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the nationwide press, Perez noticed that the white woman’s reaction was 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of blacks soon after shooting on August 9, personal articles with headings such as \"the thinking of a white woman over Ferguson - or \"Feminism is not just about oppressing women - appeared relatively late.
According to the Persians, this is an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at this level,” she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves about what had happened.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially reserved that they had to draw attention to it.
According to an English professor at Ohio State University Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson has brought to light the problems that African-Americans face every day and are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it will get 150 likes from people around the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that color is trapped in their own country, it is silently deafening.
“How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about safety in public space,” she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no question between race and gender dichotomy.
Blacks couldn’t afford luxury to share these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor who teaches women’s question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was almost all cases of rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed cooperation with a white man.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that election law could only have one group of people - women or girls.
“They decided to put cards on women’s voting rights and focus on the right to blacks later,” Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don’t believe white people.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped blacks protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained electoral rights in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching at the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the arousal of white feminists’ responses to the questions that the Ferguson incident raised - the question of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to \"hunt-up - the questions that blacks faced generations.
“It wouldn’t be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception,” Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career in the fight for reproductive law and access to contraception is now finding out what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, which demanded that white Americans protest more radically against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society, and that the views on the race that differ significantly in public opinion surveys, will seek change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem holds inter-sectional feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on the issue of race in America are confusing.
Expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of “Who stole feminism,” said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “many more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the notes of Stein’s Ferguson side face criticism that she had previously caused.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched the little My Brother's Keeper program, which was supposed to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, this triggered many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police arrested nearly 63,000 unaccompanied young people in the southwestern country this year, the issue of reform by immigration law was raised again - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chairman of We Belong Together, a women’s mobility organization for immigration law reform, said the only thing she had to do was to share the stories of immigrants in order to raise the question as necessary for women.
“He speaks for himself,” said Mercad.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have a voice in women’s organizations,” she said.
Residential piglets in Ipswichi for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, rested on it in the pig's living room.
One-room separate cottage, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig's sofa.
Real estate agency Connells said that the pig in the photo is a pet owner.
“The photo was found there by mistake, and that’s why it was already removed,” the spokesperson said.
In real estate information, Connells described the former prayer room as “the only separate one-room house”
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There is a search for a new millionaire in the south-east of Perth, and one lucky guy takes $1.1 million home from Saturday's lottery campaign.
At Harvey, they were lucky for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 was to win one million dollars.
A happy winner has to sign up.
Trade owner Steve Forward said he was talking about winning the entire city in the south-west of Perth.
It’s a major issue and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia shared one prize last month, completing several happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires of August and only a few weeks earlier, the couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple has been betting for 20 years and said that winning will allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
A billionaire from Harvey is the 59th single lottery winner in Western Australia for this year, winning a total of 85 million dollars.
Deutsche Bahn trains aren't leaving tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL described the protest as a warning bet for which he deliberately selected the time outside of the traffic tip.
The chosen time bet takes GDL into account many people who return from the weekend on the railway until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people coming to work during the day,” the trade union said in a press release on Monday morning.
“Our first bet should hit mainly freight transport, less already passengers,” GDL added.
DB has not yet published an official response to the announcement of the strike.
It is not clear how the protest event will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
Trade unions demand a five percent increase in wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of engine drivers varies from 36 thousand to 46 thousand euros (998,000 to 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
The D.B. engineers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to approach salary growth while shortening working hours.
They point out that the wage assessment of engine drivers must be developed in the same way as with other railway personnel where DBs do not count on shortening of the working week.
The Krest’s car was about to burn.
The Barum Rally is over.
What exactly happened?
It was a defect of material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think anything like that could happen.
Could the exhaust not be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to service, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we were going straight there, yes.
But we had two more erections waiting for us, and that couldn't happen.
It has a high temperature and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You have completed five speed tests at full speed.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt like a fog.
We were quick, but I didn't go over the vintage.
Everything was due to the fact that the car we were drinking for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You cut it so you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and my car so that we really had to win.
The work didn't come inward.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one who had given up early in the fight for primacy.
It was also followed by foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many favorites have resigned?
Yeah.
Especially for the audience, it was a shame, because the race ended early.
Jaromír Tarabus was at the top for a long time.
However, he paid to fly off the track and took on a nearly two-minute manko.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the winner's degrees.
It was the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had prepared the car well.
He was driving very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again make a regular participant of the rally race?
I'm sure not at this moment.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I didn't keep it.
I decided to drive her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'm probably going to do it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you like it?
To some extent, we started because of them.
Many people, known or unfamiliar, asked if I would go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumca?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow Honza Sykora from us for this race.
With Mira we have a European two-way race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for this next year.
Can you suggest anything?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsica Rally belonged to the World Championship, you reached your peak in the series in fifth place.
Don’t you want to try the tracks again?
He's not attracted.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have to give your doctor a confirmation of the inability to work, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
You did not immediately notify your employer.
Consequently, there was an agreement that the days would be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer’s consent to take leave in writing, in practice this procedure has been proven.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the withdrawal of leave, as in your case, denied and absence at work may be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, therefore the reason for the immediate cancellation of the employment relationship according to § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a court dispute with the employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled according to § 53, only you have the given days listed in the bill as an uninterrupted absence.
The unexcused absence in the bill does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to collect material security in unemployment), however, it is difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you re-visit the doctor and have it confirmed in writing that there has actually been an accident as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called “incapacitation” - it is only a medical document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the above document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of inability to work, as well as the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to the drawing of the leave.
This avoids any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just half of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart first hit the ball after his right front tire broke in the 172th round, and the race ended for him.
Stewart brought the damaged car to the garage, did not express himself to reporters and left.
Head of his team Chad Johnston said the car team number 14 was disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
“I want us to have a better performance and a better conclusion,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can do more.
Stewart came into play for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required the right side of his car to be repaired.
“We put hope in today’s race for a good ending,” said Johnston, adding, “it just didn’t work out.”
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York City, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation of a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who drove Stewart into the road during the race.
The authorities said it would take at least two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked on 10th and then even on 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 he was out of control, and came out of the second turn, and came to Stewart's, sending both cars into the castle.
Stewart continued, but moved to 21st place.
Prague selects new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection process at the new taxi station manager.
For 103 parking spaces, he receives around CZK 12.3 million a year.
Until recently, 150,000 crowns were collected for the same seats for taxi drivers each year.
This was reported by Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used to use a draw when choosing administrators.
The winner then won the rental for a flat amount of 1000 CZK per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, the amount of the offer is determined.
“A year since the termination of the original lease agreements and the opening of the tender procedures, it has been shown that the new rental system is far more advantageous and generally fairer for Prague,” he said.
The most expensive fleece is in the Persians
The highest prize was offered by interested parties on the Na Perštýn street.
It will pay $2.1 million a year.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for places in front of the Municipal House or Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi stations were adopted by the councillors in autumn 2012 and last summer they declared the original lease agreement.
The selection procedure was held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 posts.
For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
We have always released it, creating a practically second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo there.
Amazing gun!
Our well in the cellar has always found enough beautiful fragrant water.
And it wasn't anyone who was professionally done, his grandfather excavated her with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was only three-circuits and overall distinctive, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed like the water wasn't smelling.
We wondered if there was anything down there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible, with a little bad luck, there did not quite reach the plate, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise there was nothing in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we deleted it and cleaned it again.
Of course, we improved the improvised gasket around the pump pipe.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
On the ground lay a glued package with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a glare mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are breathtakings, the invention of grandfather, there were the remains of fish!
And heavy jets!
Our basement is also unique.
Someone would say his grandfather was just a little bit of a cottage.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only suffocated sand, only the ceiling is conquered.
There are mainly ships.
And bikes.
And sun loungers to the beach.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling, several of the above mentioned passages.
Without a net, so they normally fly birds there and build nests on the beams.
There is no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be lukewarm, and that's it again.
However, the luft did not help.
The whole cellar smelled.
We also cleaned the entire cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw out things that were around: boards, heraclite plate, and so on.
Our remote cottage welcomed the passing disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who could have pulled out the ugly remains?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It would be hard to come to us.
My grandfather was attacked by one neighbor who was not quite right.
If that Franta didn't give us the disgustingness of the air in there?
He's been here practically all year round, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, only for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water from a forest well is nothing I would like to do for a long time.
We once heard the terrible anxious bark of our bitch.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long black hose next to the veranda.
The chain jumped over her and slid like a fool.
My mom extorted her because she thought that Rez had been digging a garbage hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partly entangled into the club and partly tedious.
The balcony was low.
The cutie got a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
A little bit over a meter long and fat like a bullfly, she was about to swallow a huge oil, and Rez was defending her.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the experience in the form of our whole family, she probably said, \"Let us eat it when we're hungry, and elegantly stretched through the air into the basement.\"
We flew after her.
As a flash, she jumped behind the well.
By the way, we recorded another smelling package on her plate.
According to the smell of a fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new safety around the pump was a bit of a chisel.
We closed the cellar during the day.
That would...
We went out there, and there we were all lying down to one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's fucked up behind the wells.
First, there was a flat head with yellow moons on the neck.
Then the whole bottle went to the well.
She moved around the pump and started to get inside.
A fired employee takes revenge, buys notebooks at the company and sells them
After his release, the employee bought computers at the company and then sold them.
He was able to spend his money before the police were arrested.
In a short period of time, the man purchased a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
“He took the notebooks after taking over to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars,” said Chief Commissioner of the Šumper Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of fraud was the employer’s revenge for the release and also the profit of money.
“In the interview, he claimed that he used the money to pay loans,” Brückner said.
Police have also found that a fraudster is a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated for psychiatric treatment.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
“The fact is that we didn’t find any money with him,” the Commissioner said.
A fraudster who has already been punished for theft now threatens to stay in prison for one year to five years.
The police have not yet reported whether there is a threat of punishment for bazaars who bought laptops and sold them.
“It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious,” the Commissioner said.
However, none of the bazaar owners have been charged yet.
Come on, a little bit, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers prepared a few changes for us.
The biggest was the change of the route that brought the target to the flood instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took pictures and filmed videos together.
To bring my view from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal driver.
Together with my friend Káťa, we were obediently ranked at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted the friends who walked around us into the sector for faster runners.
There's not much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on sportstesters, counting off and start!
Screams of joy, but instead of a quick start, there was a swing to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and run at a pace of 10.
We go through the yellow snake of runners who run their first race like Kata.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky gives a view of Vyšehrad almost to the gypsumic touch.
The pulsating meat stretching around the waterfront looks like the whole Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Visegrad and the National Theatre, it traditionally begins to show who has how much strength.
A light hill on Palacky Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before going to the Theatre, I see police escorts, and immediately after him, Vizk Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the destination.
I hear the admirable bloated sighing of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to swim with me, but just before that, my leg will shake, and our hands will be narrowly gone.
The stage of the Theatre Street gives you a chance to relax and relax for a short time.
There are places in front of us where my views are breathtaking.
The turn on Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I don't breathe and my legs almost carry me alone.
After the first snack, there is a moment of truth.
During the course of the road, Káťa stratifies about the curb and shows the jump floating.
I see if she needs help, and I run a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues with the Kozí aisle, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, although there is no such a rush at this stage of the race, yet it is necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I do not know yet that the concept of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to knock with anyone who offers a hand, and I recommend it to Kata, because ten glamours with fans are like half an energy stick.
It really works, we accelerate again, and even if we have fallen quite significantly, now the fighter race has begun.
We overtake dozens of runners when I pass someone especially tired, trying to encourage him a few words: ‘Come on, a little bit more, you can do it.’
After the last snack, no one's coming over, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but it really needs to be taken.
The sun has slowed down and the end of the day is symbolically ending the race.
The last run to the bridge, the turn and only the straight to the finish.
The pace at which we run is astonishing to me, where does the girl get in?
“Come on, we’re going under 13 hours, we’re doing it,” I said.
We're trying, sprinting, and there's a goal.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Just in order to break Kath's legs, I help her to the railings where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well done performance.
After a while, I slowly pull her out of the target space.
Euphoria does not allow us to think about the press in the passages to the dressing rooms.
Here it is seen that Goat Street was not the narrowest place.
This is only here for the purpose of a flood, which is under the attack of nearly ten thousand runners filled to crack.
If someone doesn't like the crowds, it's not a place for him.
Even after a while, I'm losing my head and wondering if the beautiful views and the more interesting route were worth what's going on in the finish.
From my own experience, I know that organizing a race is not fun.
If 10,000 people join it, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere of the yellow baths was transferred between the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random viewers stepped it up on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, during the urban run through the historic centre, there must be obstacles that cannot be removed, but the aim of the mass race in a place that is on the one hand bordered by the walls and on the other by the river is not considered the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with the goal, I consider it very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but eventually everything went well.
Write us a discussion about whether you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the destination.
Prisoners in Bulgaria are organizing protests
Hundreds of prisoners of prison service throughout Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest assembly in front of the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
There are also higher salaries on the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The guards of the month symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although prison guards’ unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“The negotiations are still underway,” said BNR head of the Directorate General of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is also expected that members of the Federation of Trade Union Organisations of Workers at the Ministry of the Interior will join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we don’t see them.
Physicists usually don’t write bestsellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University went black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the violin problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today - trying to unite two great-functioning but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is doubtless that in search of a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The physics fundamental problem between two key theories (although at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solves so ingeniously that it is worth retelling to lay people.
In addition, Greene consulted with the complex material so fresh and engagingly that he could not be found out how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, his error was largely corrected in two more books: the Structure of the Universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to the fact that his book has become obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years there will be only a little bit more alive in this area (e.g. because the LHC accelerator will finally go to 'full gas', so it is a good time to enter Green's non-violently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
However, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us for a moment turn our eyes from the universe as a whole to something more underground, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine a hundred-metre garden hose stretching from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from half a mile away (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you will easily notice a long horizontal hose drawn, but if you do not suffer from sharpness, the thickness of the hose is hardly recognized.
Because of your great distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you answer it with only one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometer distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we will see a sudden second dimension - in the shape of a circle hanging hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that ants can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension after the length of the hose, but also in the - dimension in / against the direction of movement of the hourly hands - around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle of a winding hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of the strings.
Non-vulnerable aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is depicted by a direct arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimensions along the hose are long and easy to see.
The size of the unfolding hose circuit is short, 'sliding' and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
They are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, slid and much worse observable.
Of course, in the above case, we just did not make sure that we ‘slided’ the dimension of the coiling thickness of the hose is revealed.
It was enough to take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillar - we would only reveal the coiled dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he printed with a stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical claims by providing an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be infested into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question of how this Kaluzian insight goes, together with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which he made clear and specified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and slid dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe also has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize each moment.
But analogous to the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, which are so tiny that they remain hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
In order to get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluzov’s remarkable design, let’s stay for a while at the hose.
Imagine drawing a relatively dense number of circles on the hose circumference.
The hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With far-reaching now, thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the coiled dimension even easier, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
The Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, so together four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
In order to help our imagination a little bit, let us note the illustration of Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we increase the view of the geometry of the space similar to that of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of magnification) if they are wetted into a sufficiently small space; thus we explain that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square network shows the commonly known - large - dimensions, while the circle depicts a new, small and sliding dimension.
Just like thread loops in a thickly woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - only because of the clarity we have placed them in the intersections in the square network.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, depicted by the side of a small square in a square network.
In each of the following, we will focus on the small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of magnification.
However, when we move on our way to the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we will see a suddenly new, in the shape of the circle of the coiled dimension, similar to the loops of the thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions, just as the hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
In the interests of clarity, we have only defined the circular dimension at some, regularly located points.
Figure 4 of Kaluzov and Klein’s idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry summarizes.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has a large dimension of only one.
The even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
The basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - much more difficult than observing the apparent, large and extensive dimensions.
If the size of an additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be revealed beyond the strength of our state-of-the-art enlargement tools.
The most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension, which exists in every point of three common large dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the top-down, left-right and front-back-independent (and parallel) each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four figures, in addition to the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzovo and Klein’s reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can hardly see the smaller sliding dimension.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluzian idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about one Planck's length, i.e. the size far beyond the distinctive abilities of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzová-Klein’s theory.
Wohn Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: 5th part
The whole essence of the twelfth consists of a twelve-act harmonic form that you can freely repeat.
Anyone who taps into music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola was Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating a puppetr and a puppet conductor whose Facebook profile can be watched here, they are fed as graphics from their high school twenty years ago.
He is a guitarist of the band Wohn, from which he is reportedly unable to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as did his brother Matěj, leader of the Wohni.
Start training on one string.
“The rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, you just have to apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve,” Honza advises.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what you can do with the 12th harmonies on two strings, and how nice it is starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already coket with a tune of some song.
When you finally add the fourth, beware of the tuning change, Honza warns in the video.
The next time, Honza returns to the pentatonice and tries to put her together with the twelve.
So practice her honestly.
Best of all, you can read this in an interview with Jane Homola on his first lesson in playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It is not for the great celebration, acknowledges the castle Dvorák
We take the point and we love it.
The first half had more chances of us, the second home,” said the attacker, who this time scored from the penalty cup.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, was he just accompanied by a huge sandbox?
I didn’t see it especially, even though it would be worse at the second goal, where there are domestic fans.
You leveled the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored the goal after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, the horn came from it, and then the penalty.
After that, you got up and the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did this change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't explain why.
But it is also probably true that they said something about the break at home about their game, they probably weren’t very happy with it.
You only scored for the first time on the opponent’s field, while you may not have had a goal at home yet.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's such a difference, it depends on us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that's a different category.
You were waiting for four games, didn’t you worry that it might be similar after the last game?
Not really, but of course, we’re glad we haven’t had to talk about waiting for a goal since last match.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for a big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from the kilometers of a distant crater.
The lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through the underground tunnel from the kilometers of the distant crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
Now, the scientist is concerned about the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From last morning (31.8.
2014) still departs from the bud approximately the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but -only - 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is 50x bigger.
However, scientists are concerned that the lava tunnel could be opened even in places where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, in addition to the similar intensity of the present eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption is to feel a strong smell of sulphur, from the cracks rise cloud of steam and gases.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case in the case of an eruption at Fimmvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger, and there are also many more gases,” says Vulkanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
The weather has improved considerably since yesterday, but there was almost no wind in the morning.
Traces of the sandstorm were washed by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.

Heaven over Cheb belonged to the courageous Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings.
A plane day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced by the air acrobatic Peggy Waltin, who during the flight emerged from the cockpit to the chest on the upper wing of the double platform and also between the wings.
There is only reference to the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb took place this year for the fifth time, and the organizers were able to prepare several interesting air pieces again.
At the oldest Czech airport, the premiere was not only a walk on the wings, but also a legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He took his attention with his bright cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking are native to the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to do so.
However, due to a large number of deaths, he was banned.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the flight day program.
Peggy comes out of the cockpit to the top wing.
He's doing different exercises there.
At the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues,” said Ludek Matííček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
Boeing Stearman 75 E is the pilot of her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main nail of the program, then the subsequent performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the surface with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so-called on numbers).
For the first time, air fans in the Czech Republic could see such a lineup.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone the breathtaking acrobatics of 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was included in military reserves.
Since 1963 he has worked in the civilian sphere.
And as a racing aircraft.
Today, he has his home hangar at the Munich Hradiště airport.
In the same place is another pearl of the Cheb Air Day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no big machine at the airport.
Its polished aluminum coating was shining remotely.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard was also admired by the French Air Force.
A small transport aircraft was surprised by a retaliated Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation to the air day from Hofu, Germany.
German neighbors showed up in Cheb with renovated Jako 18T aircraft or three-member Bücker Jungmann biplane formation.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhy exchanged parental concern for the workers for at least tonight.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator doesn't know anything about it.
It was a good thing to host TV news as if it didn’t stop with him for two months!
It’s only two weeks since the blonde ended on 6th Sunday, where women experience the most stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not show up regularly in the main news session of TV Nova.
Regular return is expected according to information.cz up to a month.
Only her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black hit.
Exhibitions for a year in Prague?
Hala would sell out, planning to say goodbye to Jagr
It would be worthy if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how to build a union,” he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a breathtaking Nagan team reunited.
Also players who participated in the golden hattrick.
Players would like it, wouldn’t they?
I'm sure.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, one day can be found during the tournament, when it is completely free and where such a match can be mixed.
We'll tell Gum (Jirim Šlég) or Beď Ščerban (the organizer of the Jihlavan match) who'd take care of it.
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play with New Jersey playoffs?
So when I get here...
You don’t want to play in representation.
Or did the Jihlavan meeting change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and there are decisive performances in representation.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but the performances are decisive, especially at the World Championship.
There should be players who have it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy this Nagan discovery?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
People have come to life with stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for hockey players.
The most important thing was Ivan Hlink.
And it is good to remember the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmanek in turn.
Do you still have your first game?
These things are not forgotten.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we joined in one three.
It was the first representation start for everyone.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, we can't say that.
Dominik Hašek was caught in Jihlava for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagr for the reasons he decided to end the representation).
The Hnička was also great.
One night he was training with me, and there was a punchy one.
And now he caught up.
First the United States and then the Netherlands, footballers begin to qualify
On Monday morning, prominent guests came to NH Hotel.
People could see the goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, representative coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the figure in the black cap, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The backup Arsenal and the captain of the team arrived at a meeting around half-twelfth among the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
“Who wouldn’t be happy,” he said, as he was already in the representation set before the journalist.
Czech representation program
Monday 1st September: the start of the meeting, the first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autographies (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the meeting
Russian and American fans can support the match before Wednesday against the United States (20:15).
The presentation for them opened Tuesday training, which starts at 18:30.
And it will be followed by an autograph, on which both Russian and Czech will not be missing.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It’s an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
“We’ll have time to practice things that haven’t been done so much so far,” Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January, praised.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The team has three matches under Vrbou, all preparatory.
She remanded 2:2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
Only now.
The match with the Netherlands will start qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if the General could handle the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We need to think about being successful,” said Vrba.
The only player who has 25 health problems is David Lafata.
He's suffering from temperature.
If he could not recover until Wednesday's battle against the United States, coach Vrba would call another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she was only a few years old.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK has said poor diagnosis is common among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that around 23,000 people suffer from CMT in the United Kingdom, which can manifest symptoms in the field of motors such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the affected, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before celebrating her eighteenth birthday, she would be caught in a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and everything took longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other children, and I was bullied at school because of how I walked and ran.
When Rodgers was thirteen and she was after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she used to use her doctor to leave the room, and looked into her documentation where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
“I felt guilty because I had promised, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, I was totally outraged.
I thought before I was eighteen, I'd end up in a cart, and by the time I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my abilities.
I was alone and I was planning a funeral.
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she expected, and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, \"Girl, I don't think you've got the disease, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous --
After several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of happiness,” she said.
CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to highlight the disease.
Businesses in Washington: Taxes raise with economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes as well.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation firms in the country with the acceleration of economic recovery last year slightly increased and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia combined for the 2013 fiscal year to state and local treasures took $27.6 billion, which is 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion chosen in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third growth year in a row after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local taxes by 3.9%.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56%, is from trade tax, and 36% of Maryland’s income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows relatively the smallest business tax revenue.
Researchers claim that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which this year after three consecutive years with a growth of -1% increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from major states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid more than $10 billion last year in state and local real estate taxes, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not drive up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the real estate tax represents less than a fifth of the company’s taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax accounts for almost half of the state and local taxes.
“In Maryland, he owns a lot of corporate property, especially tax bases around D.C., government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
A recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed only to a recovering real estate market.
According to data, business revenue appears to be increasing as well.
Companies in the region published a tax on corporate income of $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised one billion dollars in corporate income taxes, most in the region.
Although they are in the same direction, local tax burdens do not grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the tax increase below the average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of 6% of all three districts (all of which have the same tax).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the legally established rate of income taxation could be reduced to up to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax imposed by small businesses as a personal income tax - a structure of compensation for increasing costs by raising prices, according to which most companies are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20% to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers say the trend and national trade tax increases are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenue for government and local governments rising to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may be lagging behind others because the reduction in state spending is taking its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's shears
Will a new state be established in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in south-east Ukraine, where government troops with pro-Russian rebels have been clashing since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current anti-Russian sanctions regime, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war on the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Other sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has enforced the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose a further consolidation of the anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit has decided tonight.
It was told to journalists by the permanent president of the meetings of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye to replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council at the European Union Summit, the so-called EU President, who runs the Member States' summits.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuy will be replaced.
Catherine Ashton, Italian Foreign Minister, Federica Mogherini, is at the forefront of European diplomacy.
Italy, which will become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.

It is about knowing the CIA manuscript, they needed war, writes Huml about the shooting down of flight MH17
A member of the ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, “the harsh sanctions that were declared with regard to the shooting down of a civilian plane with nearly 300 dead caused the Ukrainian army deliberately”
In addition, according to the legislator, it is the CIA's manuscript.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching, and the parties are once again offering impossible
The end of homeless people on the streets, parking for each family and cable car above Prague.
This is repeated before every election: parties promise impossible.
And now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are overestimating who likes the voters more.

Joan Rivers' family: \"We keep our fingers\"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since they brought her to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has said today that she does not lose hope of a 21-year-old coma recovering.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a phone call for a rescue service that said she had a heart attack on the Yorquillian endoscopy at Upper East Side, according to the source.
Doctors deliberately keep it under the influence of the sedates and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition, which remains “serious”
The reactions did not wait long, including incredible support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headline
That the media are overcoming reality with their headlines, there is no news.
I know the headlines “sell” newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called “readers” who read nothing else.
And that's the fact that I've been very concerned about lately, the word is more appropriate.
This is particularly true of articles about the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines are quite common: Israel attacked Gaza
Only in the text can you read that the Israeli-attack was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This is the title: Both sides broke the ceasefire.
Does the journalism community realize that they are directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Sixty years have not passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shoa.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted out the slogans of the “Jewish pig” and similar contemporaries, I was crushed.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler did not succeed?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews they were destined to destroy the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen journalists, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as the “seeing dogs of democracy”
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech people would be destroyed and the Czech Republic would be removed from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also be aware of another fact.
In Israel, almost 20% of Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go to Gaza, they’ll answer, why would they do it?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top health care (I have seen with my own eyes how the top private hospital of Hadassa, which is funded by the sponsor donations of Jews from all over the world, often goes to Arabs and are treated there, of course).
Hamas is also attacking his Arab brothers with their missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus this restless area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, to be indirectly in the headlines.
Tell Hamas about his abuse of people as human shields.
Please note that Hamas intends to liquidate the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Report that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.
Please note that in nine years of the Gaza Authority, this region could have been flourishing with humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which Gazans do not pay, and they are even upset that the supply of electricity is occasionally interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels, so that suicide attackers could penetrate them in the territory of Israel, but for example in the construction of housing houses, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon to Buy Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed the information claims from Monday morning: Internet retailer, producer of videos and hundreds of other things, buys a video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement triggered surprise not because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google seemed certain for one billion, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was just three years ago founded by Justin.tv, was forced to become a commonly used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online game streams to it - words Business Insider \"YouTube for live gaming -
Interface Twitche.
On YouTube there are already popular videos \"Let's play - a kind where the wiserlants (mostly the older) give the plays of Mystery Science Theater processing.
The fact is that YouTube comes to a lot of shock when describingTwitche, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch did not bother anyone much was a textbook example of how the established company will pay off the potential competition.
It’s a mystery why the YouTube deal didn’t come out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Everything we currently have is expressed by Twitche Emmet Shear’s CEO: “We have chosen Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster.
Another mystery is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who claim to do sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing games instead of real playing just watching.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder at three in the morning, as Resident Evil plays, and a completely different thing is to observe someone stranger getting 20 hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without you being able to check the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe to get a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Bannisters of our electronic time finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch will probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits per month and is fourth on top of internet traffic.
How will Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch blends into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
However, Twitch has something that every company wants to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, \"They believe in the future of the game - and the media don't seem to be reluctant, nor like - the swallow - the viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist Vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the theme of “Holy Scripture is the Word of God”
Included the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us: Who will you believe?
God’s word or the word of man?
It is as if human exploration was completely nothing compared to the authority they imagine to have their doctrine.
But when they say “man,” they talk about science.
And when they refer to “the word of God,” they refer to myths about God-written people.
If there is indeed an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who added another series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn’t create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, storytelling.
And they were the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every allegedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were “motivated” or “inspired” by their favorite gods, or have listened to the dictatorship of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and no longer gods at all.
If there really existed one true God, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If such a being had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, the only Holy Scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to believe her blindly, because she would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would continue to inspire every reader to unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would have expected nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the only religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into more and more separate denominations, searching for contentious truths, and each one in some way claims God’s leadership, regardless of the continued divisiveness and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláh Kitáb-i-Akdas, Zarathustra Avesta, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or Urantia, are all considered to be the absolute truth, and the 'revealed word of the one true God', and the respective believers each say that the others are on the path.
The only logical explanation is that everyone is on the path to some degree.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apology (defences), because they contain irregularities, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are proofs of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - with the fact that each can also contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The chief theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it a contradiction, rather a mutual commentary.
We need to point out again that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not a story of an eye witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e., the five Books of Moses, and the authorship of either of them is not attributed to Moses, because almost certainly it did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezdras) of several related oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by doces and ebionites and their completely different insights into Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these arrangements applies to the King of Ugarita, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers were a major threat to young Mosaic religions, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, “The Lord on the Mount,” changed to Belzebuba, “The Lord of flies.”
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently changed for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened with the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commissary decisions at the board in Nikaji.
The four Gospels were accepted, and the sixteen others were rejected by simply lifting their hands, as if the fact of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in Christian centers.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that he was approaching the same evangelical stories.
This is how the core of the canon evolved from the very heart of the early church.
So the Council simply accepted as an evangelium any relevant stories that circulated between the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could this be approved if God were the true author of this random mix of reputations, parables, and Psalms?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too enlightened, rather vice versa!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically entirely wrong, almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire readings, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone's blood, it would cure him from the gluten.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were survivalists, and bats are birds, and whales are fish, and they're all numbered.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they would give birth to a striped telate.
How could this be said by someone who knows something about genetics?
The authors of this book did not know that.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain such errors as it contains.
If she had come from a truly superior being and had been intended as a literal history, then she would not have contained anything of what she contained.
As a moral guide, it is totally failing because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted wonders who overlooked or supported animal cruelty, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
But creationists are still ignoring all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn’t have their beloved books, they wouldn’t have a god.
There is one and the other in their world.
Ironically, they reject God’s “work” as “respecting creation instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the overthrow of their allegedly \"holy\" books somehow dispel God as such.
Not their version of God, but every version of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God lies.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made witness, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are his word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
All that people have approved or rejected into their supposedly \"unchangeable word\" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, and often deliberately changed and twisted by mere missing people.

A Chinese school attacker killed nine people, three of whom died.
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, entered the primary school building in the morning and attacked around half an eleventh of the local time.
Three out of nine people who were killed later died in the hospital.
Chen later killed himself with a jump from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one descendant in line with government policy.

Apple iCloud reportedly depended on hackers, naked images of celebrities got public.
Screenshot of the screen with a list of leaked files
So far, an anonymous user on 4chan is posting naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com said.
It is reportedly obtained by unauthorized access to Apple user accounts, where affected users have uploaded them via automatic backup of iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet addressed the problem.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as falsified, but has already admitted the authenticity of the images concerned.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for Katniss’ title roles in the Hunger Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, which starred in Deathpaste 4.0.
The aim of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
U.S. magazines have reportedly shown interest in the footage, according to 4chan reports, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is probably really a weakness in iCloud security.
In fact, a tool appeared on GitHub two days ago that allowed you to obtain passwords to user accounts through a thick force, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool worked demonstrably, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to various accounts before the publication of this tool.
iCloud users should change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The leak of naked images of celebrities is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although company servers such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in households or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to backup explicit photos online or any other sensitive content, encrypt files before uploading.
Reasonable is also to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on the wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Thus, you will be able to move sensitive images in a timely manner - to safety - and most of all, you will have space to delete failed images, so they will not take unnecessary time in online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
Smart way to save money for a college script
Since the award for a university script for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, the upcoming student of the second year came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented the system of lending books from senior classmates with the offer of nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“I got a calculation book that normally costs $180 for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,” said Schroeder, 19 who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, an average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online stores and creative solutions such as Schroederovo.
On the rise there is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the semester of the book often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A retreading survey shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought by the National Association of University Stores in university bookstores.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower on the internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book \"Calculus - Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler is almost $ 290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new one at Chegg.com, in a textbook-specialized retail store, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind other people’s comments or wear and tear, the appropriate options are the learning texts used.
At Chegg.com, “Calculus is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25th, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid for a copy of \"Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business\" at Amazon.com.
The new one was sold for $48.
University-based teaching, Rodriguez Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check to their teachers whether the older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If so, older releases may be sold at a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about $20 for the whole semester.
Get acquainted with the terms of the store in which you borrow the book, including the penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don’t return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows \"Calculus - for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by literary students, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go after the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be joining Pepperdine Law School, recommends that you follow the line because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it is really in stock, Gault advises.
He convinced himself of this on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Bahna, the mud.
And then they found torso rifles from the end of the war in the well
This well stands a short distance from St. George's Church.
We discovered the growth around and we began to pull out an aeronautical deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and a burning leaf.
As we approached the clay bottom, we came across the head,” said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it was a torso of the assault German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them,” added Novák.
All the wooden construction things have broken down over time, so it is unusable.
But her body is well-preserved - it holds its shape.
How was the well?
One explanation exists.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of not being pushed away.
The fascists wouldn't have done it.
They threw weapons in the woods,” the searcher thinks.
The rifle was the only thing enthusiasts from the Duha Jeseníky movement found in the well.
“There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them once, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully understood the mud, so that there was no disaster, but there was nothing else down there,” he said.
The discovery ends in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech Republic
An exclusive interview with Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev / Pravda - 'Excuse me, I must take it... they call me from Donetsk,' he apologized perhaps eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktunalne.cz Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War.
Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban in a TV debate.
In each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or the places where they are - or should be - which Ruban details with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
\"That's it - go there,\" he concluded one of the flash discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a back-up general, former fighter pilot and active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
He was still in Donetsk when we had a conversation.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to 24 hours a day.
You may know that Czechs are also fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number by 30.
There may be many more of them, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechnya, one Swedes, Georgia... but not yet the Czech Republic.
But I know who to contact in Prague if we come across your captive countryman and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured separatists
A.cz: What do you recommend to the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers take them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, volunteers and separatists fight in the Ukrainian military, they will be shot without grace, as well as any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be rent mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers occupy a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them the Czech Republic - then they will place him behind bars and deal with him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also acts in war as a state.
Q: How many Ukrainian prisoners have you saved?
If I understand it well, in exchange.
Some sources say that it has long passed hundreds of men.
For a long time we stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we only freed them... from the war, we didn't save them if they decided to continue fighting.
The rescuers are doctors in the war, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's it.
Every day there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it is enough to release prisoners and simply ask for them.
A.cz: You have gained great authority and even trust in pro-Russian separatists in a few months as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me a nickname - a mad general with steel balls -
It's not insulting me.
And maybe it even describes the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officer's Corps, I have gained some authority before.
I never find, cheat, and always keep a word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're tortured and killed.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I exchange prisoners, and I'm captured... this job can mean an end to me at any time... I don't have to come back.
Q: How many executions and tortures do you know?
... (long silence) ... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners.
I'm sorry.
And executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners, I have no information.
There are no signs that the Ukrainian military is doing something like that.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't give the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence, and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk, at least that’s what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their irreconcilable opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they ate them all the way to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were shown in Maidan by the way.
And now I'm going to talk a little bit: Russia supports separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation a big one and the other one a small one.
But this sentence already hides an unconvinced contradiction.
A.cz: How, for example, does one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler appear to you?
Every time I cross the lines of the war front, I am without weapons, and I show soldiers or armed men unfolded bare hands.
And I always have both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in the optical router.
Those faces of the people who are headed at me, I always see well... and they can push the trigger of their weapons at any time.
The paratrooper, an experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family, his mother, lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small gubernie in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it, and he considers Ukraine a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you called your Prime Minister Arsenii Jaceňuk a weak, helpless and tired leader - who would do best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred meters of walking, I always get at least five times fear.
Why, then, should I hide with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that it harms our country?
A.cz: Do you think he is involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Jaceňuk call it “the king.”
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians, from which he would be afraid or have respect and authority with others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he does not have the right to cry in parliament in war, to beg him, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten to place a function... he must direct the country, manage it and protect it in times of war.
In threatening the country, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on crying emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
He acts like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just always complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians couldn’t save their sales
Sylvester Stallonea has returned less than $30 million from the U.S. budget and Sin City: A woman for whom I would return only 12 million from the 70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million on the first weekend, as well as films for children like How to Train a Dragon 2 was a disappointment for the cinema.
According to a film critic, Robbie Collin in Telegraph, children’s films are of their own quality.
Collin described 2014 as the \"worst - year of children's films,\" and How to Train a Dragon 2 called a \"functional\" continuation.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Day of War Victims and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar to the quality of last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in audience access and a higher popularity of Internet servers like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Jungle Book Processing, told Hollywood Reporter: \"I think times are changing -
We have to admit it and not try to pursue what has already been.
Contrary to the current crisis, the Hollywood cash registers have made Netflix profit with $1.2 billion online services, almost twice as much as $837 million last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too much on the rights to comics, and predicted \"the collapse\" of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators declare that there may be something on his catastrophic divination.
With the launch of possible major cash registers in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoni and Jurassic World, other figures are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply \"cyclical\" - For Hollywood Reporter said: \"The next summer will be the summer of the largest casino cracks in history and no one will worry about selling -
North Korea threatens Seoul again, launching another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The missile test was carried out shortly after the end of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as a preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies in the north-west of the KDLR along the border with China.
A spokesperson for the South Korean Ministry of Defense said the missiles were fired from a site in the North-West of the North-KLDR and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently first launched a missile from the province of Chagang, South Korean media said, citing military circles.
In the province, there is an underground launch ramp for Scud missiles.
This is another of a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests took place against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the City Hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairycklough watched the situation during the weekend and spoke with the protesters who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers must have been transported from Blue Mountains.
The DVA youth tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after they spent the night in Blue Mountains, New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man went on a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday.
When they didn't come home, the alarmed relatives called the police around eight o'clock in the evening.
A search engine, including local police and a rescue team, was sent and a couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 o'clock in the evening.
The girl hurt her knee, and the man fell and then hit her head.
The police stayed with them overnight and on Monday morning they were picked up.
In stable condition, ambulances were transferred to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, he had a win on his leg
The 23-year-old forvard could decide, but failed in two of the biggest chances.
After the goal, the shot was called close to three minutes before the end, but the place on the net ended on the goalkeeper Opava Josef Kveton.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I’m angry with myself, and I’ve put your ash on my head.
“I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it took a bit of a while,” he said.
The defense of Sigma did not allow the Opava much, except for Mikul’s 11 minute raid, which was covered by the Reichl goalkeeper.
Then the Hanans began to push, but in the block they did not let go of the home, and the missiles from the distance caught Florist.
We were comparing for 15 minutes, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But he didn’t change the chance of yours, so it ended 0:0,” said coach Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point because of the absences in the assembly, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vavřík was missing with three-ball shooter Petr Ševčík, who guests from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike its previous policy, it did not allow them to enter.
The replacements deserve discharge.
Sigma was more footbally, but we didn’t let her do anything except one standard,” said Petr Baránek, Slezan coach.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and struggle.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us,” he added.
Sigma got four points with the draw, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébra, who, after defeating Znojm, made his million-dollar deposit in the cashier's diametrically different performances in other matches.
“We realized Mr. Lébra’s warning, so it can’t be said that the boys wouldn’t want to fight,” Kalvod noticed, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter, “I believe it will come and when he gives the goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first shot, I'll replace him to save his goals for the next match,\" Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has doubled Venice.
The film festival is experiencing a crisis.
Following the immense enthusiasm over Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days showed the impression that interest in the 71st Venice festival was somewhat reduced.
Whether it was because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by criticisms recognized, but for spectators less attractive images as a document on the genocide of Indonesia in the 1960s View of silence and other social-related films from American 99 homes to Iranian Stories, there was simply an empty seat in the cinemas.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace did not yet besieged such crowds as in the past and allegedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute seat at the hotel.
There is more talk about the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has been affected by such esteemed institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but only in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield’s comic superheroes, who in 99 homes were quite successful in playing dramatic roles, for all generations, the main event of the visit of legendary actor Al Pacin became without distinction.
He was in two movies right now.
In the story of the Performance released outside of the competition, filmed by Oscar Barry Levison, according to the novel by Philip Roth, he has a 40-year-old Pacino role that is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a strange iron owner from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actress should not miss it - but does the artist still have the format of Paci's needed prices?
Perhaps for him, the greatest satisfaction is the love of the audience, and the Italian especially, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino reports proudly to the country from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
The Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film to be awarded a long knock.
The Kalabrian mafia is seen looking at the family relationships between clans that fight for power and money, and the director has been able to match all the assumptions for a good film: a good script, a camera, music and an actor.
He also captured the chamber psychothriller Hunger Heart, which filmed Saverio Costanzo with Albo Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost destroys her own child by her pathway anxiety.
On the contrary, French competition films have not received a warm reception of neither the Redemption for Fame nor the 3 heart, both works embracing on the traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of the acting representatives.
But, after all, two really excellent films, i.e. Birdman and Black Soul, are not so little at the first half of the festival.
And even though the festival images have a lot of depressive themes, the new Peter Bogdanovich film, titled She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy featured in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of the American cheerfuls of the 1940s, was able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Police caught four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, the drug was taken from Poland
“The detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug pervitins in Prague from November to August 9,” police spokesman Jana Rössler said in a statement.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlárká Street caught a twenty-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who featured in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a dose dealer.
The following day, the detectives arrested another member of the group on the basis of the prior consent of the public prosecutor, a 17-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers hit on Wednesday morning on August 20 at the Malešice incinerator’s site, the spokesperson said.
A woman received a third of the drugs for transporting drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field.
In the workshop of the summer complex, in the garden house in Horomerice, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitins, provided various equipment and chemicals necessary for its production and provided the transfer of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He then weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags, and sold pervitin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drug addicts, a 25-year-old woman helped him.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced,” added Rössler.
The criminals also conducted several house examinations on the basis of the judge’s order, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other devices and items that can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
“The police found out from the available records that the main organizer had been seven times convicted of property crime since 1995, and that the woman was not prosecuted in court,” a police spokesman added.
The last man arrested in 2006 was conditionally convicted of a crime of sexual abuse, and a 17-year-old automechanic who has been prosecuted in prison has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
It was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of drug and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they are at risk of a ten-year prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator also gave the prosecutor a motion to impose ties, where the judge eventually placed them,” the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 17-year-old recidivist, ended up in freedom.
His position and role in this case were not as crucial as those of the other accused.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
As part of its other products, Ferrari offers very interesting things for a lot - interesting - prices.
As a good example, handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm playing board will be used in Italy.
If you like, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43 405.
The customer will get a set of wooden black and red-painted figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
No one is surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse.
If chess doesn’t seem to be a valuable gift enough, the Ferrari 500 F2 is also available (manually) in scale 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disturbing high school and high school doesn’t make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics also show that gymnasists have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
Usually it is a routine matter, such as transferring flower pots from the summer storage back to the classes and fascinating the wings.
There will be a little bit more frmol at the mountain school.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment as well as literature in the library.
There was no theft or defamation, a four-year high school in Hořice after three years opens and renews its activities.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incapacitated.
They had to wait for the school’s existence to be confirmed by enrollment in the school register of the managed MSMT.
“French socialists should shut down and put France in order,” said Francois Hollanda’s key ally.
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to “show its support to a militant socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the consent of most French.
The president deserves general respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
“Our duty is to stay next to him,” he said, gratifying.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite Emmanuel Macron’s passionate guesses, a new finance minister who suggested that the rules be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to remain “consistent” with the government.
Christiane Taubire, Minister of Justice, made a line over the budget when she appeared at the meeting of the rebel socialist MPs, where the Socialist Party criticized for “the French lost their faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, leader of the ultra-conservative right, laughed at constant internal disputes among socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls was forced to form a new government when the previous government did not last until the end of summer.
“And the new won’t last until the end of autumn or winter,” Le Pen said to her supporters.
She repeated her party's call for Parliament's dissolution and said she was convinced that it could win an early election and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in March's municipal elections, and in May, the extremely conservative right succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several competing factions before the end of Holland's 2017 term of office.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that France would soon be patient if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could even worsen.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved until the new management of the capital.
From the streets of Prague will not disappear before municipal elections, and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no restrictions on dogs.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in October elections.
“In addition, the decision to change should not be made by the city’s current leadership, to which the mandate ends in a few weeks,” said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several city halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel the area of gambling in their territory.
But the game will not disappear, the gambling order will not change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we would not have technically achieved this due, for example, to the time limits for the submission of comments and so on,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, which must be approved by the Decree, will take place on 11 September.
On the day of municipal elections, the city districts Prague 1 and Prague 8 are going to be banned from gambling.
Currently, gambling bans are in place, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1 is complaining about this, which has already sent the Magistrate a proposal of places to extend the current list of forbidden places.
Musicians do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angel.
The law governing dog walking the city is going for several months, so far it is not completed.
The location of the herens and the issue of busking is addressed by the municipal decrees.
They can only be issued or edited by the City Council.
The city halls have only an advisory voice, they cannot issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed victory on Scottish independence proponents at hand
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether they wanted Scotland to be rich.
But you will not get to the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor will you get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots tend to drive the exchangers out of the temple far greater than to get them to dictate how they should vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and so he repeatedly asked his opponent, Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the “sovereign will of the Scottish people” if the Scottish voters voted for independence and began to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London’s financiers, and fell into this trap with grimas.
Of course, Darling won't support the Scottish voters' mandate.
However, the discussion about Scotland’s currency has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, employment opportunities and defense of state health services that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London’s bankers in the matter of currency, and also gave the impression that he would not protest the privatization of health care.
As Salmond said, “he entered the bed with the conservatives.”
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to the voters, but to the Association of “Bosses” to the Confederation of the British Industry.
It is clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent home.
The Scottishs would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a \"successful independent country\"
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it almost causes him physical pain.
What he says is clear: “Scots should not jump out and have to accept what is.”
The longest year is 10 months.
The Pessimistic Beginning of the School by Miloš Urban
Illustration of the Tale of the Longest Year
Miloš Urban Longest year
The end was the best of the holidays at all, the last week that didn't go anywhere, and we were just entangled and cuddled with my grandmother's summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the quick arrows, the fiftieth, the splintering on the bike up around Imperial to the back of Vara, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun was starving his back and his shoulders, and the rays clicked goodbye.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep until the middle of the eleventh, in a week will be worse, the moments before falling asleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, and the morning will wake up at half the seventh.
He's coming Monday.
It usually does not rain, on the contrary, the summer is deceivingly before school.
Arriving in the panoramic light on the armrest and looking like a plastic figure in a glass miner, there's that school, ZDS A.
Zapotocki with a glamorous pink plaster, and before her old familiar faces as well as a few new, boys drawn out, girls breastier.
There are groves, avoiding them, as it is interesting, how infallibly they hold together and how early they are here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who have come screamed are now laughing hysterically at something, I guess something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is with me at the old age.
And again, new first-timers, some nervous and others happy, why are they even going down here?
Because it must, by educational war.
So in there, the cool moisture of the floor and the light odor of disinfection, the poisoned schoolgirl with a mop, unfortunately still the same as that which is said to lend the student a keypad from the sheet cabinet, where the textbooks can be left and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room remains in mind, now it is not done, it is well ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It's just from the idea that the stomach is squeezing and the head begins to hurt.
The head, which is even worse to learn from mathematics, the devil's game for the chosen, among whom I am not and will never be.
Again, the threes and the fours, the fives, hide from the test, fall into the bench and sublime best, be there and not be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream stories of nicer girls and nicer buildings, of antennas to space where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone, and does not beat anyone’s foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, like years ago.
She let her daughters die.
She is threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a cabin of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any foreign help, she was born a girl who, after she had cut the navel, wrapped in a prepared blanket, hid under a bundo and took her to the road pivot, where she put her into shrubs located a few tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school.
I think it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I had a need to go to the bathroom, there I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the shears I wore to school,” the defendant said, saying she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
“The following day, she returned to the place, put the child’s body in her backpack and took the body out of her backpack, wrapped it in a black needle bag, and hid it and left it under the staircase in her grandmother’s house in Havlíček Broda,” she said.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket, or when inserted under a jacket, under cooling or bleeding from an unsustained umbilical cord.
The same scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, nearest undetected from February to April 12, when the child's corpse was found by random witnesses under a bush at the pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, was secretly born.
This time in the bathroom attic apartment in a family house.
She did not check whether she was born alive, without she cut and tied the navel, which was rounded around her neck, put the baby in several plastic cases, including a plastic bag and left it in the bathroom.
He was then taken to the pond with his partner in the afternoon.
Finally a friend gave it.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, who reportedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For this reason, he is not now in court, but has been punished for a sin against the funeral law.
It was also him who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not punished as a complicit.
He was manipulating a child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it came to me at that moment as a human, - it did not hide the indignation of the defendant, who allegedly underwent and feared him in the relationship.
During her testimony, a young woman spoke fairly well.
The tears in her eyes only took her to the moment when she talked about the relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching her age.
She didn't want to kill
“He goes to visit me every 14 days, doing everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she exclaimed.
I didn't buy the equipment because I didn't want the kids, I felt young.
I was gonna put him in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that way.
I can’t explain that to you,” the judge answered.
However, she refused to act with her mind and intention to kill the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was also born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
However, I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I also restricted smoking,” she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, she also claimed to have health problems with her repeated questions.
And that's my friend.
The main trial will continue with the castle court on Tuesday with court experts.
A judgment could be delivered on Wednesday.
A woman is at risk of a criminal penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or of an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is nearing Prestige Cruise’s three-billion-dollar buy-out
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the world’s third-largest cruise operator, has advanced in negotiations for the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market-value company that competes with greater competition from Royal Carrebian Cruises Ltd. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.
The deal may be published earlier this week, a source said on Sunday, but said the negotiations still may not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be appointed because the negotiations were not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, the Apollo spokesperson refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
The 29-billion-dollar cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise in the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
The company competes to become a preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the closing of the trade of $850 million.
The Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise introduced shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration of regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a capital share of 28 %, Apollo 20 % and private investment firm TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documentation, the first public offerings include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and Norwegian Cruise, a total of 82% of North American passengers.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists provoke Chinese authorities on the day after the vote
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing who had a Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved only two out of three candidates to participate in the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointing committee, which is likely to be composed of members of loyal Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on electoral tickets and get pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial center with protests of the “Centric Occupation” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report setting up Chinese official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city’s business district.
The press conference, attended by Prime Minister Li, is hosted by the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong-based Chinese Contact Office.
During the day, several press conferences were also to be discussed by the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Zhang Ronghsun Legislative Commission and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei Office.
Student activists said they would gather in front of Hong Kong’s government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations with Ukraine about “state sovereignty”
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and to immediately start negotiations on \"state sovereignty - torn areas.\"
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to suggest that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian-speaking area would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to Kiev’s government to deal with the pro-Russian rebels as being equal corresponds to the obvious strategy according to which it follows from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorus real independence so that instead of the West it can connect with Russia.
In an interview with the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were ruled by separatists after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists of the recently occupied territory referred to it as \"Novorus - or \"New Russia - a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.\"
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin’s words that “the prisoner of illusions - anyone who believes there are peace talks on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while government forces attack the civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
“In the interests of people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of the society and on the status of the state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev’s leadership for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas of threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, \"because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict -
The intervention of the Kremlin spokesperson, which was meant to correct \"the wrong interpretation of Putin's remarks,\" stressed Russia's approach to solving the separatist uprising in the East, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two-million-dollar population is originally ethnic Russian.
Moscow should also be more difficult to annex Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls of public opinion that took place before the conflict have shown broad support for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine its own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving Kremlin real control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the seat of the main Russian naval fleet, the maritime commercial background and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea are also centers of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During its inaugural speech of 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators, following new elections, consider changes in the constitution that would give more control over their finances and language status to various regions.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's last call for Kiev to act as a separatist was followed by a further process of rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks from previously peaceful areas along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists strengthened the Russians took control of Novoazovsk by such force that the Ukrainian security authorities are concerned that it is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory to Crimea.
This has resulted in a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsky and a narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels and encouraged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken any definitive action - the leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after last week, two colonies of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region to support besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovajsk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also involved in a scandal with exposed photos.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disdain for hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his wife Gabi Greece and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after, in the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrities, a series of explicit pictures of Nude Jennifer Lawrence got online.
Hacker claims to have sixty pictures with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Ernst Dunst.
As a result of the release from iCloud, personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece were reportedly taken public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for his hand last month, told the Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told online newspapers that hacking is “unhampable” and those who have become its target “are degraded.”
It is believed that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with a former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which he unfolds above by the pool.
Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, where she was her counterpart, Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of Chuck Strahovski's television series and actress of the thriller Sucker Punch Browning didn't comment on the stolen pictures yesterday.
Representative Lawrence T.M.Z said: “This is a clear breach of privacy.
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Putting photos of hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma footballers have won, even without winning.
Olomouc - The thunders and flashes that the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent down to his subordinate last week are, it seems, the past.
In the end, they brought only a point for a defenseless draw.
By deploying and fighting, the club bosses have just made a little difference.
Payout money could soon come to the club.
“I’ll keep one more game, as I said last week, but I’m far more optimistic,” Lebra said, saying that despite Sigma’s failure, his players had convinced him with improved performance.
The combat and deployment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In such a case, I am able to forgive that he will not win.
If we played that way from the start of the season, I am convinced that we haven’t lost yet,” Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial domestic pressure, then the game leveled, and in the second half it was already better.
After Kalvod's victory, the creditors reached, but they did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our ideas.
“We lacked only one changeable chance to complete satisfaction,” said Lebra, who did not think that a change in the approach of the footballers caused only his threats.
There were certainly more aspects.
“Whether on my part, on the part of the coach or the fans,” said Lébr.
With pressure, Sigma must count.
Players did not want to comment much after the game in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to admit it,” the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
He left the question to Lébro’s statement last week, the attacker Václav Vašček, who did not change the biggest opportunity of Sigma in the Saturday match.
But then he talked a little about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
They all want to pull us out.
“Today we have shown that if we fight and we all ride our ass, we can,” he said.
Warnings were taken to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not blacken the fact that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that last week was in Olomouc.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lébra's warning took it to heart.
Even though it wasn’t even before that they didn’t want to fight and blow it off,” he said.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a long time to compare ourselves to the hardness and realize what the other league was about.
“It’s not just about football, it’s about fighting,” Kalvoda said.
It’s important to hope that Sigma will work from the beginning in the coming games.
“I would love to believe it,” he added.
