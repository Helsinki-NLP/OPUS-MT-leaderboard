Bosnians protest Croatia's plans for radioactive waste storage
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia in protest against the plans of the neighboring Croatia concerning the storage of parts of waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad asked Croatia to abandon plans to build waste storage facilities in former military baskets in Trgovska Gora and declared their fight against the project.
Waste from the Krško nuclear power plant would be stored in the facility.
The Bosnians, holding banners with the words \"I want a healthy future - and \"Stop\" (river) Una needs us - said that the radioactive waste dump could threaten the Union's river and the life of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We have to say no,
He told the crowd of Miroslav Drljaca, mayor of the Novi Grad municipality.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s is also part of Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional waste storage.
Croatia’s public television company HRT said on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided whether to build the waste site itself or pay for the storage of parts of waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatian Environment and Energy Minister Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents, on every side existing in the country of ethnic division, insisted that Croatia find a different location in part of the country closer to the power plant.
“Why Croatia in all its area claims that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place,” Drljaca said.
We can't let them be humiliated!

U.S. Congress agrees to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
The U.S. Congress for 15 days after the approval by the State Department of possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multi-task fighters did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The decision of Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
“After approval of sales by the State Department, and now through Congress, I see no more serious obstacles,” said John V. Venable, senior defense policy adviser for the Washington Conservative Think Tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Armi Export Control Act, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned arms sales abroad 15 days before signing the contract if the value of such a transaction, in the case of arms sales to a NATO member state, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed transaction for the purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistics assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of the F-35 aircraft - if the transaction is finally completed - will be the American arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is a manufacturer of engines for F-35A fighter companies Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of the fifth generation F-35s on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak in May.
The offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting of President Andrzej Duda with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalized, will be supervised by Pentagon representatives under the Foreign Military Sales Program (FMS).
Under the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired, among others, the Patriot missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland’s offer of purchase was about $89.2 million, without armaments and technical assistance.
According to the US military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was “the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated.”
“The prices are falling, the price of one F-35 is now below $80 million, much less than the cost of the Eurofighter, which has no such advantage as the F-35,” Venable said.
The PAP spokespersons expressed hope that Poland’s final negotiations on the purchase of US warplanes would end this year.
The potential share of Polish subcontractors in this transaction - i.e. offset - will be discussed directly with the American F-35 fighter manufacturers.
What is the replacement team of Münchhausen, referred to in the series “Payton Hobart Elections” on Netflix?
The caregivers and parents with the above disorder pretend that their healthy child is sick.
Payton Hobart’s election will be on Netflix today.
It tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but must first become chairman of the student self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's television series, \"American Horror Story\" and \"Glee,\" we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt, and Lucy Boynton.
Not revealing too much details for those who haven’t yet seen the series, he’s addressing the subject of Münchhausen’s replacement syndrome, a mental illness occurring in caregivers who act as if a healthy person who has been concerned with physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this condition, e.g. Münchhausen syndrome, which consists in causing symptoms of a given disease.
The replacement team of Münchhausen consists in simulating that the person under our care has certain ailments.
It is also called the invented and caused disease, and is treated as violence against the child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent who is exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms, so that his or her child is sick.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen replacement syndrome?
Symptoms of this disease may vary, however, NHS draws attention to the following examples of behaviors:
Convincing medical staff that a child looking healthy, however, feels bad.
Exciting or inventing symptoms.
Falsifying results so that the child is considered sick, such as giving glucose to urine samples, to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Causes of symptoms of the disease, e.g. by giving children unnecessary drugs and other substances.
How often does the Münchhausen replacement syndrome occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs, because many cases of the disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 shows that over two years 89 cases of this disorder occurred in 100,000 people.
What should be done if there are suspicions that a child may be in danger?
Please contact the local special services department or call the NSPCC Children's Protection Authority by selecting 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid at Kaduna school, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna, a police officer in Kaduna, has launched an airstrike at Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal School, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi’s local government area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were in highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities denied this claim.
Shehu, a preacher at school, said: “They don’t tell the truth because all the children were there with the consent of their parents.
Before the children were admitted to school, their parents signed the form.
Every day, parents brought food to their children and knew the conditions.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as the removal of all the food provided by the parents before the school was closed.
It’s not okay because parents can prove whether their children are in bad conditions, according to the police.
He added that the previous Commissioner for Police Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of care for children, had never had reservations.
He said that children study the Qur’an and nothing else.
However, a police officer for Public Relations, Yakubu Sabo, said they would join their parents after the state was handed over to the government.
“They have been tried in dehumanizing conditions on behalf of subjecting or acquiring the Qur’anic knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their back, which proves that they were beaten.
That is why we are studying the school to know its owner,” he added.
Foreign Talents Important for China's Development
Guangdong is a leader in the country in attracting foreign talents largely due to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Great Bay Area (GBA) of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao and the new role of Shenzhen as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group conducted interviews with seven expatriates between the ages of 10 and 70 in Guangdong.
Yash, born in Singapore in 2010 during the Asian Games in Guangzhou, said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientist and doing a doctorate in Guangzhou.
Nikki Nikandrov, a Russian student at Shenzhen University, said: “Thanks to the BRI initiative, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
Together we can create new concepts and new projects.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the United States began her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over a million fans in Bilibi and Weibo.
She said she will continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her films.
Leticia de Lassus from France, head of the JJB International Montessori AMI Centre in Guangzhou, agrees that “Children’s education is like wearing jackets.
If you turn on the first button incorrectly, the rest will never go to their right place.
Henry Xiao, an American of Chinese origin, believes that at the heart of the GBA area, his company can benefit from many privileges in relation to new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
The producer of the culinary program \"Nanta Show - Sean Choi from South Korea said Guangdong's cuisine is known worldwide and the introduction of the \"Nanta Show - in Guangdong\" program was a good decision.
Stephan Moler from Switzerland, who is the Technical Director of Quality at Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high quality is in the proper performance of simple work.
To his surprise many talented young people in China like to work, learn to do good products, and constantly strive for better results.
Poll: Poles want Banasi to resign
Most Poles want the resignation of the head of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia, according to a Kantar survey for TVN.
Asked, “Does your boss NIK Marian Banas have to give up? 55% answered, “Yes,” including 34% marked the option “deciding yes,” and 21% “yes,”
The answer: “I don’t know,” 26% of the respondents chose, while 19% said, 8% said, “no” and 11% said, “no.”
Marian Banasia’s resignation requests appeared after the release of the report, “The Armored Marian and the Hotel for Hours”, in the “Supervisioner” program.
It follows from the material that the head of NIK was the owner of a tenement house in Krakow, in which the hotel was to operate for hours, and the gangsters were to rent a tenement house for a price lower than the market.
After the disclosure of the material, Banas announced that on September 27, he would go on a free holiday until the review of his property statements held by the CBA was completed.
The Kantar telephone survey was carried out on September 25-26, 2019 on a national sample of 1005 people over the age of 18.
The possible measurement error is 3 percentage points.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
“I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win elections with President Andrzej Duda,” said Tomasz Siemoniak.
The vice-president of the Civic Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in an interview with Polsat News spoke about the affair with the head of NIK.
“This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become the Minister of Culture from some entertainment, not the head of NIK or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who's responsible for billions of dollars, for taxes,\" he said.
“This is a very serious state crisis,” he added.
Siemoniak also spoke about the candidate of the Claudia Jachira.
“There is Antoni Macierewicz on the letters of PiS.
A man who not only said things, he only did them.
He judged former SKW chiefs for espionage for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why no one calls for Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the letters,” he asked.
\"People younger than us have different aesthetics.
I think Jachira, who for one of the things has already apologized, also feels that she is sometimes exaggerating.
“Let’s not make this a campaign problem,” he added.
Tourists after the fall of the travel agency Neckermann Polska are planning to return to the country
As the office said, it was not necessary to bring tourists before time.
“The office is successfully paying for the insurance guarantee of the unpaid hotel venues,” he said.
On September 25, the travel agency Neckermann Polska submitted a declaration of insolvency to the Marshal’s Office.
There were 3600 tourists outside the country at the time of submission of the insolvency declaration by the office.
On Wednesday, a group of about 500 people returned to Poland, and on Thursday 230.
On Friday, another 350 people from Morocco, Spain and Greece will return.
Tourists will arrive in Katowice and Warsaw (in total it will be five charter flights).
Some of them will return by flight.
About 1,000 tourists should return to the country on holidays, including Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy, as planned.
According to the information provided by the Marshal’s Office of Mazowieckie Province, the travel agency sold some 20,000 trips for the autumn and winter season.
“These travel agent customers should contact the insurer, Allianz Partners, directly.
He also added that “the situation of tourists who signaled problems in hotels at the moment seems to be stabilized, and the emerging incidents of washing out tourists from hotels have been softened together with consular services.”
Last Friday, the largest and oldest travel agency, Thomas Cook, said it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned 100% of the shares in Neckermann Poland.
“The obsolescene, a masked child-rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court.
Dressed as a masking man, he caught a 12-year-old schoolgirl from the back and pulled her into the thick-haired dubbed Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to the tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed in his home, where officers detained a number of relevant items for the investigation.
A man has admitted to blame for the seven charges related to the attack and the next three concerning the perception and sexual abuse of another girl, 11 years of age, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim walked along the path, and as she looked behind her, she saw how unexpectedly she left the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she pleaded, “Stop, stop, stop,” he took her by the neck and forced her to enter.
The man said, “Silence, don’t scream.
Don't scream because I'll have to hurt you.
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable straps, and later tied her to the tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When she was cut off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man came to work at around 9:30, not responding to several SMS and calls from colleagues.
His clothing was dirty and carried traces of grass and tree, and he himself claimed to have participated in an accident of rage on the road, during which he hunted another driver in the bushes and fell from the spray.
The next trial of the man will take place on Tuesday.
Pope calls on executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned chief executives of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement poses a threat to increasing social inequality if the common good is not taken into account in its course from the point of view of ethics.
Pope Francis spoke these words during a conference in the Vatican, attended by envoys of governments and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at a conference entitled “The Common Good in the Digital Age”
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in a debate on the prospects and threats of artificial intelligence.
There was discussion of technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work, in connection with which machines will play an increasing role, as well as a study of the case of the Christchurch attack in New Zealand and decisions made by social media companies in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During a speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that thanks to machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers were saved dangerous and monotonous work.
He warned, however, that increasingly dependence on robotic devices in order to make profits is a risk of depriving people from the dignity of work.
“If technological progress had become the cause of increasingly visible inequality, it would not have been real and real progress,” he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an undesirable backsliding to some kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
The conference’s organizers expressed hope of using expert knowledge of participants and identifying possible future Catholic church advisers in high-tech matters.
Martin Odegaard, a real Madrid rental player, puts fans in euphoria with an effective assist.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assist in opening Mike Oyarzabal's goal.
Winning 2:0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbs to the top of the La Liga table and continues the pass of being unbeatable on its own pitch this season.
However, despite not having one failure this season in La Liga Zidine Zidane, she is under enormous pressure as a result of a turbulent pre-season and public dispute with a Welsh star, Gareth Bale.
The situation reached its boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talent at their disposal, with some of them having plans for others not.
Vincius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in the team.
However, it was a Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was rented to Real Sociedad, who caused a big move, including incredible assistance in the La Liga match.
During the meeting with Alaves, Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assist at opening the goal of Mike Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad eventually won 3:0 in front of his audience.
After taking the ball from the right side, Martin Odegaard extorted the player from the opposite team, putting the net on him, and then sent an amazing centimetre between two other players and his teammate only left to put the leg.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third in the performance of the amazing Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty throw, ensured a decisive victory by Imanola before Manu Garcia was sent back from the field five minutes before the end of the game.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel confident on the pitch.
Anna Hazarde surprised by the appearance of the name of Sharad Pawar on the fraud about the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra
Anna Hazare said: “The name of Sharad Pawar wasn’t on the list when I was given this case.
The social activist, Anna Hazarde, did not hide the surprise that the name of Sharad Pawar, the president of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, appeared in connection with the multi-million dollar fraud at the State Cooperative Bank of Maharaštra.
In short, the investigation agency, the Executive Director, ED, filed a case against Sharad Pavar, his nephew Ajit Pavar, a former deputy chief minister of state, Maharashtra, and others in connection with the fraud.
The information report of the Executive Director on the case, equivalent to the police report of the FIR, was submitted by a central agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The basis of the case is a report by the Mumbai Police, in which the names of the former president of the bank, Ajit Pawar, and 70 former employees of the financial institution were mentioned.
When the case came to me, the name of Sharad Pawar wasn't seen anywhere.
“How his name came out, who gave it, only they knew these things,” Anna Hazarde said on Thursday when he was asked about the ED case and the alleged connection between Sharad Pavar and the fraud.
Anna Hazarde, critically evaluating Sharad Pawar, expressed hope that the truth will come to light as a result of a detailed investigation into fraud.
“ED will find out where his name came from in the case,” said Anna Hazarde, a multiple participant in the demonstration against corruption.
Sharad Pavar denies a criminal act and claims that he was in no way associated with the bank, as well as puts the question mark to the fact that the case was filed a few weeks before the election of the Maharasht Assembly scheduled for October 21.
The former Minister of the Union assured that he would not fall to the Majestic Delhi, clearly referring to the central government led by the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the case of the Executive Director as being motivated by political considerations.
Working day of SG.
Yesterday, several smugglers failed to bring stolen items worth more than 130,000 zlotys to Ukraine.
All events were recorded yesterday (September 26) in the direction of departure from Poland.
In Korczowa, the citizen of Romania carried a bicycle with electric drive of the brand Specialized.
The SG officers, determining the legality of the object’s origin, contacted the representatives of the German Police and quickly established that a modern one-print worth about 10,000 zlotys was stolen in the territory of the country.
A few hours later, in Korczowa, border guards controlling the semi-trailer registered in France found interference in the VIN number field.
The driver of the truck set was a citizen of Ukraine.
The trailer worth about 30,000 zlotys has been stopped and will be subject to detailed experts to determine the original data.
On the other hand, at the border crossing in Medicine, the SG officers have depleted the attempt to export another stolen Can-am quad (prod. 2019).
The value of the vehicle carried on the bench was estimated at PLN 75,000.
The driver of the set was a 32-year-old citizen of Ukraine.
The Border Guard confirmed that only two weeks ago the quad was lost in Poland and is sought out throughout Europe.
Medically, “partial” attempts to export a stolen vehicle were also denied.
A 41-year-old Ukrainian bus traveler transported bodywork from an exclusive Mercedes.
All identification marks on the parts were mechanically removed.
Body elements worth about 15,000 zlotys were stopped.

In a statement released today, car event organizers stated that, as the preliminary reports suggest, after the event ended and the end of its change, several hostesses remained on site to watch musical performances.
On the way, one of them unfortunately attacked unknown men and later died in the hospital, according to a statement.
On Friday, the UKZN suspended classes, claiming that “the circumstances of the death of Ndlov require us, as a community, to stop and reflect on the fragility of life and the brutality that so often occurs in our society.”
Mylan agrees to pay $30 million in EpiPen settlement
Mylan agreed to pay US$30 million in a settlement related to the lack of information to investors about an investigation by the Department of Justice on the possible demand for too high an amount in Medicaid for EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday that Mylan NV qualified EpiPen for ‘generic medicines’ in the Medicaid Refund Programme.
Therefore, the pharmaceutical company provided the government with a much lower return of parts of the price of the product than in the case of the classification of EpiPen as a ‘brand medicine’.
In July, Mylan revealed that it had reached an agreement on the principles of the KPWG.
In its statement on Friday, the company said it did not confirm the KPWIG’s allegations or deny them.
Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, death of a child.
These are dramas that cause a lot of suffering and are hard to understand.
We ask: \"Why -
Sometimes we also hear that “God wanted to do so.”
Is it the Creator who sends us unhappiness and sickness?
John Paul II suffered a lot at the end of his life.
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his father was scared to leave the room.
“My son has no hands or legs,” he shouted to the doctor.
Parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of their limbs.
At first, they couldn’t accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months, Nick’s mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujicic is a world-renowned evangelizer and motivational speaker, thanks to which many people are converted.
“I am proof that God is never wrong,” Nick said.
“When suffering touches us, it’s hard to understand.
We're looking for causes.
We ask, “Why did this happen to us?”
If we believe that God reigns over the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises whether He has sent us sickness, misery.”

Boris Johnson addressed to police supervisor in connection with close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Office for Police Procedure (IOPC) will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the prime minister to explain whether, during the public office as mayor of London, the abuse of criminal offences was committed.
The Council of Greater London (GLA) said in a statement that its Supervisory Inspector had registered a \"problem related to the proceedings - a prime minister in connection with the allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri to result from a linking close knowledge of them.
“The question of ‘action’ can be discussed when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime,” he said.
This does not mean that this has been proved in some way.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue is addressed to IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
She was sent to the police supervisor because Johnson was the equivalent of the Commissioner for Police and the Commissioner for Criminal Affairs.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred due to his close relationship with Arcuri.
He said he would follow the London City Council order and give details about his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted that the council would “group on the wrong problem.”
The order is a result of a report from The Sunday Times that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received £126,000 of budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign commercial missions, led by the then mayor of Johnson.
As a result, until the case was examined, the government frozen a £100,000 grant to the Arcuri-owned Hacker House.
Governments are waiting for troublesome questions about the verification procedure carried out before granting funds.
Digital Minister Matt Warman said in the House of Commons that the employees of his department \"usually kept due diligence - and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were redirected to an office in California, where 34-year-old Arcuri is currently living.
A close relationship between the Prime Minister and the businesswoman “was a secret to the staff of the polysynel”
GLA’s decision to refer the prime minister to IOPC’s independent police conduct office was dissatisfied with 10 Downing Street.
According to a source from the upper rank of the government's representative, \"the attack is politically motivated - and its term - on the eve of the Conservative Party conference - is \"publicly political -\"
“The surveillance inspector did not provide any evidence confirming the allegations, and the prime minister did not get a chance to answer him before he published a press release late in the evening on Friday,” the source said.
Neither the citizens nor the media can get such an openly political bill.
The Standard said Johnson’s close relationship with a California businesswoman, assisted by the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was a “mystery of police” for employees.
The employees of London & Partners (L&P) said Arcuri had received seats during Johnson’s foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that at that time her companies were not considered “trustworthy.”
The third accused of drug crimes in connection with Mac Miller's death
In connection with last year's death of rapper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and charged with committing drug crimes.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills, which he had in his possession before his death last September as a result of a accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and ethanol, a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia,” which absorbed several thousand human lives in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected to have played the role of “a courier, Walter, who provided pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller’s death, nor did any of them present a line of defense in his case.
Walter, under the 2005 drug exemption, is in custody and has already been sentenced to prison for five months for breach of the conditions of exemption.
The prosecutors of the case, the first to report on the TMZ celebrity website on Thursday, demand that Walter remain in custody in anticipation of the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of fleeing the accused.
The answer to the message left on the automated secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettit was charged in a federal court on September 4, and his defender refused to comment.
Miller’s words are a sincere talk about his depression and drug use, making him a fan of the biggest hip-hop stars.
Originating from Pittsburg Miller, which was actually called Malcolm Myers McCormick, he remained in connection with singer Ariana Grande for two years.
After his death on Instagram, she released a moving film featuring Miller and a song called \"Thank U Next\" in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been associated with opioid abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the band 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of an overdose in 2016, and his body found the presence of ethanol and hydrocodone.
This article introduced a change: Walter's correct spelling is \"Stephen - not \"Seven -\"
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 mobile games
The 9-year-old creates a fast game with a free Scratch 2 programming app.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 mobile games.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he catches a bat that comes out of hiding.
I learned how to create games in an accelerated course.
“Now I create them when I’m bored,” said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad signed him up for a five-day accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15 years.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was designed to provide children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The father of the boy, Basil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always caught the phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run,” CNN’s father said.
But the interest of Basil in creating games increased when he was 7 years old and received a beet for spending all the time on the game.
“One day he played on the tablet, as usual, and he was so absorbed that I was nervous,” his father said.
I said, “You’re still playing or you can’t think of creating your own games so others can play them.”
In saying these words, I was upset and I didn’t think it would take them seriously,” he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in learning how to create his own games, urge parents to buy a laptop and save it for a course during which he learned the basics of creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his gloom-based titles based on their content.
One of his games, \"Mosquito Mash\" is available on the Google Play Store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were famous for using codes to create robots that separate their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the women’s high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 contest for programming robots to stack boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of tech giants like Google and Microsoft, Africa, Basel and its peers are on the right track for the career of coding stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina admits to lying about corruption
The court documents filed on Friday show that former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes, he is scheduled to confess his guilt on Wednesday.
A document containing the factual basis, prepared in the framework of the defense settlement and signed by a lawyer, Hayes, found that he knew that he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense agreement has been sealed and, on a factual basis, does not result in the allegations of Hayes being granted.
Initially, he was charged with defamation, corruption and false testimony.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the insurance company’s plan to direct the campaign to the country’s main insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two partners were charged with trying to bribe state insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, being one of the main state political donors in recent years, who has donated more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He mainly supported the Republican Party's goals and policies, but he also provided donations to Democrats.
His lawyer did not reply to a Friday email asking for a comment.
Advocate Hayes Kearns Davis did not reply to a comment request on Friday.
According to the court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn’t talk to Causey about the employees of the State Department of Insurance.
In fact, according to a document containing the factual basis, Hayes spoke with the insurance Commissioner about Lindberg’s request to make changes to the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to a April act of accusation, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance business and planned to donate up to $2 million for the re-campus of Causey in 2020.
It follows from the prosecution that the agreement also included a request to change the department official who controlled Lindberg’s company.
The former Republican Causey reported the alleged corruption attempt to federal agents and helped them collect evidence of the case.
He was not charged with any charges.
According to the prosecution, Lindberg’s partner ordered Hayes to donate $250,000 to the Causey campaign during a conversation, where Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such a amount of money would attract attention, but, according to the accusation, eventually gave way.
“Whatever you all want to do, we’ll do that,” Hayes said.
\"Well, I'll take care of it -
A federal prosecutor's spokesperson did not respond to an email asking for further information on the settlement.
Drivers will take the first episode of the new Zakopane
Drivers from Saturday will be able to use the first of three built mountain sections of the S7 expressway, i.e. the new Zakopianka - from Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój and further the two-way main road accelerated to Chabówka.
As told the spokesperson for the Krakow Department of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) Iwon Mikrut on Friday, this is the first of three sections of the S7 built south of Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabka Zdrój, which will be put into use.
From more than 6 km from Skomelna Biała to Chabówka, more than one third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, it was carried out on viaducts.
Seventeen were created, including the longest and tallest, numbering kilometers in length and 50 m in height, and four small objects on the liquids at the Skomelna node.
From this node there were congresses in Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to national road No. 28 and to the old course of DK7.
From the next node, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 in the direction of the New Targ and Zakopane and DK7 to Chyżny and the border of the state with Slovakia.
On Zbojecka Góra there was a place to serve the travellers of the ILO.
The express road ends with the Zabornia node in Rabka Zdroju, which was built around a kilometre-long two-way fragment of DK47 to Chaborówka and there it was incorporated into the existing two-way Chaborówka - Rzawka.
The S7 Skomielna Biała - Radka Zdrój and the new section of the national road no. 47 of the main accelerated class (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment was about PLN 615 million.
The guarantee of quality of the work done will be valid for 10 years.
The section of the new Zakopianka, including 15.8 km of expressway parameters, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubień - Repair, Repair - Skomelna Biała and Skomelna Biała - Rabka Zdrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is performed by the Polish-Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, tunnel section - Italian company Astaldi, and the third - Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is almost PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is more than PLN 1.3 billion.
A total of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, viaducts, estacades) and a two-chamber tunnel with a length of 2.06 km are formed throughout this section.
According to the announcement of the road manager, a 7.6 km section of Lubień will be made available this year - Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7, which the drivers will bypass the construction of the tunnel.
The last section, Repair - Skomielna Biała with a length of about 3 km, the drivers will go in 2021, after the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of about 2,06 km.
Our goal is a state of prosperity
“We are building a state of prosperity in Poland,” said Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice.
He came to Szczecin to urge him to vote on the councillor Dariusz Mathi, candidate for the Sejm from the list of Law and Justice.
“The programme of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the welfare state,” he said.
“We want the Poles to earn a lot better so that their lives are at a higher level.
This is necessary because otherwise young, dynamic, well educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a program that was committed to performing four years ago.
We said we'd put in a 500 plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said it was impossible that this money simply did not exist.
We proved that the money was and was, but the PO didn’t care about the ones they were about to reach.
Ziobro also mentioned the trip for children and the 13th pension - and that the fourteenth pension is also planned.
In addition to \"the discreet distribution of national income - the priority of the PiS is a fair state and economic development.
“Money should not reach a great stream only to the pockets of the elected, who have good relations with establishment and power, but should evenly reach the whole of society,” he said.

Part of Sopotka Street in Nisk after expansion
On Tuesday, September 24th, the expanded Sopocka Street in Nisk was handed over.
The total value of this task amounted to PLN 803,000, of which PLN 26,000 was FDS funding, while the remaining amount was the own contribution from the Niagara County and the Low Town and Town.

Facebook’s concern about the well-being of users will hide on a sample of the likes counter
As part of an experiment conducted for the first time in the world, which aims to improve the well-being of users, some of the people who use Facebook soon under the posts of others will not see a counter of likes, reactions and video views.
The likes will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, the director of Facebook’s privacy in Australia, said the change was the result of a study on well-being and the opinion of mental health experts indicating that the likes counter could lead to comparisons with others.
“The benefit from the many groups working with us to combat harassment, as well as from mental health organizations, has been really positive,” Garlick said.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of the content, not on the number of likes or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be accepted as a competition,” she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies that rely on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations they have had access to so far.
She said it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram, when the test included Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be made permanently.
“Users’ initial comments on the new Instagram rules were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions,” she said.
Speaking about the site of the world experiment, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically recognized Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with measurable opinions indicating whether a new experience is valuable for people using our services or not.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims
The Częstochowa curia does not comment on the appeal of councillors to the local metropolis of Archbishop Wacław Depo to provide financial compensation for the handling of the waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The city asks for 1 zloty from the pilgrim.
On Friday, he spoke about the speech addressed to the city at a press conference with, among others, the leader of the Spring of Robert Biedron, organized at the leading direction of the Częstochowa Góra Ally of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, the vice-president of the city’s council and the candidate for the Sejm Łukasz Kot.
Kot reported that the day before the local councillor SLD voted an appeal to Archbishop Wacław Depo for the transfer of a city of one zloty from every visitor of Częstochowa to the pilgrim - to support the work of urban, municipal services, etc.
We accepted the appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean up after pilgrims, prepare a city for pilgrims.
“We ask you to transfer a gold gold to the budget of the city from every pilgrim.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better conditions of stay in Częstochowa - said the vice-president of the city council.
Mr. Mariusz Bakalarz, a spokesperson for the Częstochowa’s metropolitan curia, initially prepared a several-day response, but then asked, as he signaled, at the command of Archbishop Depo, to replace it with information on the content: “Until he receives the official position of the city council, we do not refer to the case-
According to a project published on the pages of the Częstochowa magistrate, the appeal to abpa Depo concerns \"transfer of financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season -
“In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in Częstochowa and the increasing costs of operating the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, taking into account the image of the city among the inhabitants and residents, pilgrims and pilgrims, we want to offer participation in the costs of the above-mentioned garbage system as part of the generally accepted canons to take care of our common good, the small Częstochowa homeland,” the statement reads.
“In order to maintain the proper cleanliness of pedestrian-road lines, which are moved by pilgrims, at the same time using a small infrastructure, i.e. external baskets for waste, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 from the pilgrim,” the statement read.
In addition, in connection with participation in the annual costs that the city will cover with its own funds, taking care of the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, as well as the desire to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the said amount will be intended to improve tourist infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available.
They pointed out that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposal stems from numerous claims made by residents regarding the state of cleanliness of the routes that pilgrims move.
“With regard to the cleanliness of our city and the positive effects of cooperation, the City Council of Częstochowa calls on the Archbishop of the Częstochowa Metropolitan to provide financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for supporting the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season,” the appeal repeated.
According to the press office of Jasna Góra throughout the year in 200 nationwide pilgrimages to this sanctuary, 834,000 people participated.

Fewer than 20 people reached the horse sanctuary, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups on rollers.
\"News - TVP has missed the Confederacy in the description of the survey
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the Sejm PiS would get 45% of votes, KO 26%, Left 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5%.
The electoral threshold was even described on the Super Express portal, for which the probe was conducted.
In the main edition of the \"Reports - describing the same survey, the results of only the first four parties were presented, completely excluding the Confederation.
Edyta Lewandowska clearly stressed that only four committees crossed the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
The TVP viewers were also shown the division of the seminal mandates without taking into account the votes cast by the Confederacy.
This would give the PiS independent governments.
Krzysztof Bosak, in a commentary on this whole situation, spoke of “a public compromise on honesty towards society”
“They started with slogans about the ‘moral revolution’,” he recalled, and stated that this matter was a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki tweeted that “The TVP messages” in subsequent actions against the Confederate are ashamed of Urban and Michnik.”
He also pointed out the lack of reaction from right-wing journalists.
“But let us also look at those who remain silent.
These “righteous”, “independent”, “incorrupt.”
In a few years, they have become a more primitive version of everything they have struggled with.

Brother sentenced to life sentence for killing honorary social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to images posted on social media, was suffocated in July 2016.
Pakistan's social media star Qandeel Baloch's brother was found guilty of murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment as the loudest in this patriarchal country's honorable murder.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies - polite to Western standards, but in highly misogyn Pakistan considered provocative - was suffocated in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that there was no dissent of conscience for his actions and declared that “of course,” he murdered his sister and that her behavior was “unacceptable.”
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that the court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited judgment.
“Inshallah (if God allows), will be acquitted by a higher court,” he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
“He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and that was my son,” she said.
Baloch's murder was at the forefront of the world's information services and resumed calls for action against the epidemic of so-called honor killings, in which victims - usually women - are killed for violating patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, suffocated, shot or quipped for such crimes as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of the Balochs, for bringing their family “a shame” by manifesting their own sexuality.
Murders are usually done by a close relative.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retaliation) can ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, the parliament adopted a new legislation imposing a life imprisonment for honor killings.
However, whether murder will be considered an honorable crime remains in the hands of a judge, which means that murderers can theoretically refer to another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially insisted that their son should not show grace in any way.
However, the dismayed think that he might also lose, change his mind, and declare that they want his absolutation.
The international outrage caused by the murder has led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and announce itself as heir with its parents, forcing the case forward.
One of the more well-known achievements of Baloch is to offer to make a striptease in front of the Pakistani Cricket team and to wear a decoiled purple dress in Valentine's Day.
She was criticised and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as a breaking restriction in a country where suing for a figure modeled on Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen women’s positions.
The roots of \"honorous\" killings lie in tribal social norms that continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular normalize the behavior of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from northwestern Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations reported that increasing violence has caused the number of people displaced from northwestern Nigeria to about 40,000 in the last four months.
The UN Refugee Agency said the concerns have created a “new unique humanitarian situation” that requires an interagency effort to collect $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamist Boko Haram group, which has been leading the rise in the north of the country for decades, is not responsible for recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather a result of the activities of organised armed groups.
“This pictures a horrific picture of anarchy and uncertainty,” he told reporters on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, torture, coercion, murder and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroy houses and steal cattle.
An army and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is pulled away from Boko Haram and the branch of the Islamic State in West Africa, which separated from its former group in 2016.
“Refugees don’t come with group names,” he said.
They come for it with terrible stories.
Refugees are most likely to go to neighbouring Niger.
In a statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that more people are expected to converge to Niger in the coming months, with a worsening security situation, particularly in the state of Sokoto.
New date for trial of man accused of killing woman and 2 children
A new date of trial was scheduled for a man from Guatemala accused of killing Iowa and her two children.
According to the Act of the District Court in Polk County, 31-year-old Marvina Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under, according to the authorities, a false name that was originally filed by the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit his fault.
Police say he killed 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son at home in Des Moines on July 16.
It follows from the judicial acts that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. immigration and customs officials say Escobar-Orellana is illegally staying in the U.S. and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
“The Sun: Boris Johnson in the face of a rebellion by a cabinet that wants to lower Brexit demands and reach a compromise deal with Brussels.
At just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders, among the most important people in the country surrounded by the prime minister, there is a growing concern that it is not enough time to get more important concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of a rebellion by a government that wants to lower demands in connection with Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impasse on the new customs system, which would be a substitute for the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels defined the proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as ‘unenforceable’.
The ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers, led by Germany’s head Angela Merkel, to offer a compromise in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism at the last minute.
Journalists “The Sun” spoke to three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the prime minister after the annual Tories conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister to reject the ‘aggressive’ strategy developed by his close adviser Dominik Cummings, which is about trying to apply the blefu to the EU and threatening to leave the Union without a contract, and then to accept the offer made by the Union at the last minute.
One of the ministers of the cabinet called the ruling of the Supreme Court on Tuesday the end of Parliament’s suspension as a “warning signal” and added: “The only way to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of a contract.
We will never defeat the arrhythmias in the House of Commons, which works on our disadvantages.
The Prime Minister must now bend and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggressiveness does not pay off: it is obvious that Cummings’ plan burned on the pan.
We cannot fight battles on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister committed to hand Johnson over to try to push the deal of former Prime Minister Theresa May, if anything else goes wrong.
“If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-enter the House of Commons with the agreement proposed by Theresa May,” he said.
There are numerous opportunities for it to be voted on, and everyone depends very much on the end of this topic.
If we're forced to extend the term, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of us all.
John Major has accused Boris Johnson of taking the negotiations seriously.
In a brief speech, the first Minister of Tories said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants agreements with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he forces himself with bulls in Scotland, checks the eggs in Wales and fights with citizens on the main streets of the city - all in front of the world, as if the electoral campaign had been on for good -
A spokesperson for the current prime minister said yesterday that the deal is still distant, and added: \"No one should have illusions: to ensure an agreement is a very long way to go.\"
However, the spokesperson also said that the Benna Act, which put Brexit into effect by three months in the absence of an agreement, “will actively weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work.”
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels today, where he will hold more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss the book on how the area works for all of Ireland for food and living.
A dog without a nose and legs conquers Instagram.
Perfectly non-perfect
Kundelek was supposed to be asleep.
However, it was possible to prevent it.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by the Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The photo of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal from the first sight.
“At first, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs,” she said.
The woman decided to take care of the bitch until someone adopted her.
However, no one has yet reported.
“The fact that no one wanted her, made me want to do it more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love,” Kate said.
In the end, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
“Our Bonnie is perfect.
“We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn’t like what she looks like, it’s his problem, not ours,” she said.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
There are over 14,000 internet users on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It has been said that with a glasgic accent I will never make a career on television
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV chiefs said because of Glasgow’s accent, “he will never make a career as a presenter.
Remembering her 35-year-old career in the television industry, Kelly, 59, admitted that before her first appearance on the screen, she felt “a lot of upset.”
“I was only 25 years old, and I was very nervous,” she said.
When I worked at the BBC Scotland as a search and information review specialist, the boss said that through my accent from Glasgow I would never succeed on television.
I went to London to get to know the whole TV-am team and watch the show before I took over my duties at the office in Glasgow.
I'll never forget an interview with the star Bette Davis by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was what I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV-am correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a local newspaper reporter in East Kibride, Scotland.
Then she started running such programs as \"GMTV - \"ITV Breakfast -\" and \"Daybreak - to later launch with her morning program \"Lorraine - which the name took from her name.
The 35th anniversary of his career will be a special program during which he will remember his best-remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said the secret of her long TV internship is “pasty and enthusiasm,” and “interest,” adding: “It’s hard to work.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interested and interesting.
When she mentions media reports that have moved her emotions, Kelly reveals that \"very difficult - for her it was to report an attack in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children were watching our live program with Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we spoke for many hours at her house.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral.
She added that “it was extremely difficult to interview Kate and Gerard McCanna shortly after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in 2007 and that “he really admires their strength and courage”
They have to deal with the pain because they don’t know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition to endure the most terrible online Trollies comments.
I am with them with all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will begin at 8:30 on Monday, 30 September at ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of being imprisoned
A senior state official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiweng had rejected the offer to take over the office of President Robert Mugabe at the top of the coup because he was afraid of being imprisoned to confirm the takeover of power by the military in November 2017.
As reported last week, \"The Zimbabwe Independent - Mugabe offered Vice President Chiweng to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military as part of the coup.
However, a senior state official announced on social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer for fear, but because he overcame Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the coup.
On Twitter, which confirmed that a 37-year-old Zimbabwean ruler wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenga, not President Emerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, whom officials confirmed to the state that he was a senior state official in the Bureau of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was stated that at that time intense negotiations were taking place on the matter.
State officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiwenga through one of his messengers when he realized that power was leaking from his hands.
Mediations between the military authorities and the late former president had three stages, according to the senior rank of the state official.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was President George Charamba, a person who served as head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and a cleric representing the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-person mission to hand over Chiwenga’s offer to the presidency, who was the head of Zimbabwe’s Defense Force (SOZ).
A man who, even more than alive, was considered an icon of Africa, in vain tried to obtain from the UA the condemnation of military action, trying to force other African leaders to intervene.
The offer of the president, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defense (SSO) Chiweng, was not due to the election.
“It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously fast pace, removing some of the family of the deceased,” the official wrote.
But there was also a little political temptation by which the dead wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-disciplinary way.
It is enough to remember that the commanders declared that they did not overthrow and overthrow the constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the position of the UA on coups.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, violently breaking the claims of the leaders that they did not overthrow the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was the fact that the UA, which, on the margin, was still highly confused about the whole situation and how to fit it into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would then not have a choice other than to describe it as a coup, so the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such a compulsion that this offer was made.
The officials claimed that Mugabe had made the move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer willing to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after warning the power that he was risking a rope in the style of Gaddafi.
Army chiefs told him they wouldn't turn a gun against the citizens if they went to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, i.e. to save his family and prove that the army had taken over,” the official added.
At that time, the SSO and the commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The messenger (Gono) who transferred this desperate message was given an understanding - through a powerful metaphor - that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the Camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at the political level, the higher ranked state official claimed.
State officials say the military has notified military commanders in the area via the attaché, who were in Zimbabwe, that they are not going to overthrow Mugabe, but to report to the “criminalists” surrounding him.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try again Mnangagwa to return from a brief exile in South Africa so they could talk about a coup and a success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The South African people, which is a key element of the process, not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because then President Jacob Zuma was the President of Sadc, have refused to intervene, but have clearly indicated that if the army invades Mugabe's home, as it has often been in the background, South Africa's troops will immediately appear in Harare.
“It didn’t work because Putin and the African leaders didn’t choose this route,” he said.
China needs strong leadership or will “break down,” according to a policy paper.
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, otherwise the country will “fall apart,” the government said in a document on the policies issued on Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
The Chinese government’s press office reported in the White Paper that the country’s successes since the Communists took over 70 years ago have led the party.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, and there is rarely any difficulty in the administration.
The document notes that without China’s uniform and strong leadership, China will move towards divisions and break-up, which will be catastrophic for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used hard-handed policies as in the case of the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who will be at the forefront of the anniversary of the world’s second-largest economy on Tuesday, has further strengthened the party’s governments since the takeover of office in late 2012 and imposed sanctions on those who can challenge power.
Xi also oversees the program of military modernization, which has disbalanced the region.
The document found that China did not try to export its development model or want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, rather than \"hegemony.\"
The Chinese do not have other nations in their genes or dominance over the world.
In modern times, China was stunned by great powers, and wars and unrest pushed a deep mark on them as a result of the sufferings suffered; China would never suffer the sufferings of others.
China celebrates this anniversary in uncertain times for a country trapped in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in China's subordinate Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never “extend” its most important interests, nor will it allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
As regards the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document found that \"the danger of trade wars and the further increase in tariffs do not lead to a solution to problems -
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industry chain, a wide market place and a strong economic growth rate.
The document added that “trade wars will never weaken it.”
China is confident that they are able to face difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open a new world.
It also added that the United States should rationally look at China’s development, as China does not intend to challenge the United States’ position or want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that it will stop China’s development.
The restriction and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
The World of Jack Pałkiewicz: Dubai, the True Face
Dubai’s Emirates is a place still seeking its own identity, torn between the Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and the extremism of progressiveism.
This setting new trends, the world leader of tourism, awakens imagination and desire, enthralling the vainness of wealthy snobist hotels and attracting the fortunes of investors and traders to the status of a tax haven.
Websites infect enthusiasm with this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentration of 21st century architecture in one.
Built on oil-rich sea sands, it became Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are delighted with the ubiquitous, creative hyperactivism and hysterical pursuit of vanguardy.
Here is the city whose motto says everything: \"Survey, bewilder, and charm.\"
And at almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
According to the British writer Lawrence Octave, “full of extremes and contradictions, the metropolis has taken on the dimension of the tandem grotesque.”
It was transformed into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by “Guinness’s Book of Records,” the unofficial constitution of the United Arab Emirates.
Because here everything has to be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of excess and ostentational rest that may not be transparent in old Europe, but is important for quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home.
Not in Dubai.
When I left the world of magic, I broke his golden mask, revealing the other face of an artificial paradise.
A face which is not spoken out loud and does not write.
I show the poverty of Asians contrasting with the fairy-tale living conditions of the divine ethnic caste of the Dubaiers, grandchildren of non-scriptual Bedouins.
I venture into a place of extreme poverty, for example, to the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where under cruel conditions there is an army of Asian workers.
It was within one generation that they built in slave conditions reaching the desert sky of Manhattan.
They came here with good wages and the opportunity to provide a decent life for their families, and they found a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it, because it could blow up the myth of Dubai created over the years.
An increasingly frequent criticism of the international community makes the topic of a cheaper workforce highly troublesome for the emiira.
Mel C from Spice Girls banned diet talks in her home after struggling with eating disorders
Melani Chisholm of Spice Girls admitted that there was a ban on dieting in her home, after she had struggled with eating disorders herself, for years eating only fruits and vegetables.
For years, Spice’s sports did not work out and “obsessively practiced” due to pressure from being a member of the world-famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
At present, she reveals that her experiences affect how she raises her daughter Scarlet, so “she doesn’t allow her home to talk about diets.”
“Scarlet is now 10 years old, and I’m starting to see she’s more aware of her appearance,” Mel said.
“I think one of the positives of eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak with it.
The use of positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with Women's Health Mel, who gained fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before social media was created, \"disturbing - comments about it caused complexes.
“I started looking at myself in the wrong way, giving up on certain groups of food products, exercising more and more obsessively until I started to have malaise,” she says.
“I was sick and it probably took a few years.
A photo that shook the world
The Polish girl and American documentaryist gave the world the testimony of the cruelty of war.
Legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
“Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America has to work, it has to help,” he started his radio speech documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On the tragic, September days of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, he saw the drama of the bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His relationship was a big echo in the West.
The president of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to his family in the U.S., deposited him in the embassy safe and... he was.
For the next four weeks he tried to be wherever the Warsawers were.
400 aircraft and artillery nearly non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan suffered death, suffering, and the struggle to survive in the city's glides.
Just before the surrender, he and the embassy staff carried out negative oceans.
He didn’t talk about Hitler’s crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will meet Paris, London and even New York.”
His shocking chronicles were viewed by President Eleonora Roosevelt.
The United States soon began preparing for the war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought against German propaganda.
They made films to praise their knightry.
They said they didn’t attack women and children, and people believed them,” says Sam Bryan, the son of Julien.
Report to the jury against a former athlete accused of numerous rapes
In front of the jury there is a rape trial against the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, who is accused of numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday after 10 days of giving testimony and listening to arguments, jury jury members proceeded to settle Clay Conaway’s 23-year-old fate.
A 21-year-old woman says Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two of them were closed on the Bumble meeting page and the woman was sent by the man a photo in which he presented himself naked.
A woman is one of six accused Conaway of sexual assaults between 2013 and 2018.
According to the accusers, the huggish that the woman agreed on has turned into rape, which happened to her opposition.
Defenders refer to the conflicting relationships between women and memory gaps and claim that the woman probably regretted that an intimate relationship occurred.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million zlotys
The gold-covered bike worth a million zlotys could be seen on the jubilee, the 10th edition at the International Bike Fair Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
Its builder, 30-year-old Adam Cadnovych, just received an Oscar bike for him at the World Custom Bike Show in Las Vegas.
- The bike is covered with gold spray chrome, under it is the highest silver sample.
It's an unusual coating made by my friend from the Żor.
“There is a seat, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, it can be used normally.
It can grow speeds of 50 kilometers per hour.
It is an electric bike - it is specified by its constructor.
“The bicycle car was printed on a 3D printer.
They're sixs that make up a kind of vortex.
I came across the idea of this model on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the drawer.
The sketch was waiting five years to be completed.
The bike itself was built for three years,” adds Adam Danowicz.
“It was hard to hide all the elements under the body.
Inside there are batteries, wires, elements creating the structure.
It is hidden under the bodywork in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
The engine is also hidden there.
The steering wheel for this bike was built a week before my trip to the United States to the World Bike Show.
I couldn’t decide what the driver would be like.
She's made up of transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms, he summarizes.
Covered with gold, the bike was awarded in Las Vegas the most important competition category \"Best Amazing Single Custom -
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay, surrounded by an opera house, the Circular Quay port, Luna Park amusement park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge, is making a significant contribution of $20.9 billion annually to the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
Under the bridge, however, there is an ugly truth.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country, to which the volume of contaminants is affected every year equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic pools.
These horrific statistics make one of our biggest tourist assets one of our dirtyest aquests.
According to a new film material entitled “The Bay of Sydney, on top and bottom, water in the area of Australia’s most popular city is full of bats, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all this flows to the bay along with rainwaters.
However, the largest component of our shipping channels is plastic.
“I would call it a paradox,” says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in a video release on September 27, with the publication of this film deliberately coincided with World Tourism Day.
This aquawn looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and contaminated rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic enters our waterways, and its large part influences the bay through storm canalization.
“After such a powerful fallout of the bay... it looks quite tragic,” said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic entering the ocean reaches the bottom of the sea.
“In my opinion, if he doesn’t spend time underwater, he can’t really realize what’s in there,” said Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly, paying attention to the fact that he and his team are extracting about 500 kg of plastic a year.
I think if more people knew what was under the water, they would just be scared.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find at the bottom is plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and the rest of the trash are being mined right from the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect, said there are ways people, both local and tourists, could help reduce the amount of plastic and the rest of our waterways.
“This must start at the source,” he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better lead the recovery of materials, and be more aware of what we run in the sewage that eventually goes to the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we will be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can arrange this bay and restore it to its former splendor, and it is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The film, funded by TOMRA’s recycling company as part of its broader efforts to educate Australians on environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of containers on the environment, coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
A new survey conducted in 546 children aged 12 to 18 found that 82% of respondents felt helpless about plastic waste, and 25% of adults felt guilty about waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth-largest concern for parents, and 93% of 551 parents surveyed said their concerns about the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans were growing.
Many people who participated in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they simply do not know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.

Memes after volleyball match in semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slavs had a natural audience on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish gridmen.
There was also much controversy among the judges who did not count four on the host side in one of the actions.
This happened at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vital Heynen’s subservients had a chance to jump off the rivals and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles eventually had to recognize the superiority of the rival, who after winning 3:1 will play in the finals of the tournament.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie support psychiatric hospital in Akra
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association gave food worth 30,000 GH yesterday, a psychiatric hospital in Akra during a short ceremony held in Akra.
It is part of the activities of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.

Google is creating a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP Partner
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
The cooperation will help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region in Warsaw - a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.
The digitization of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions that were at the heart of the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of this company.
The partnership between the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the way, which we set out less than a year ago, declaring the appointment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged - digitization of the Polish economy and dynamization of its growth.
“Now Polish companies will gain additional sophisticated tools for its implementation.
Using them, they increase their chances of promotion to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today greatly strengthens our joint project, says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO Bank Polski.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and enterprises.
“Investment in the National Cloud Operator is perfectly integrated into the PFR strategy, as an important element of the country’s digitization.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
“I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists to it,” adds Paweł Borys, CEO of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytics tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all the key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner and BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators - says Michał Potokzek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the demand for the computing power necessary for the processing of huge data sets.
VI Polish Senior Parade
On the very south, August 24, 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Parade of Seniors began “Adolescence of the Magnificent - and Picnic of Generations, events organized by the Foundation of the Beginnings.
As Przemysław Wisniewski of the Foundation said: “Parada is a worldwide event.
She has already gone through the center of Warsaw for the sixth time to manifest how large and diverse the senior community is.
Through the Parade, we are countering harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and calling for intergenerational solidarity.
The parade was led by a special floor coach serving as a musical mobile scene, on which was traditionally the famous Warsaw DJ Wika.
Participants in the joyful corrode, at the second place of famous Warsaw and world hits, passed Aleja Jerozolimskimi, Kruczi Street to the Warsaw Powstańci Square, Mazowiecki Street to the J. Piłsudski Square and the Royal and Krakow Predmieście Street at the Warsaw University’s Main Campus.
During the march, which involved several thousand seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, colorful delegations were greeted by numerous gatherings on the route of the march, Warsawers and tourists.
Two organized groups in the company’s yellow and blue shirts took part in the parade.
The first representing the University of the Third Age and Club Senior+ and the second under the name SAGA, the Senior Active Group of Animators.
At the University Campus, the organizers prepared, among others, gastronomy stretches and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering senior services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.

Kurdistan devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
The cholera devils may have the key to cancer treatment - researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way to mask some cancer cells
Researchers found that the same process occurs in the Kurdistan devils and in humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatments for oncological patients
What does the devils and the people have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including those from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize cancer therapy if it doesn’t respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to treating deadly tumors within the face that threaten the future of the Kurdistan devil.
The study established a way to mask some cancer cells in humans and in kerbs, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which turns off a marker that would otherwise give a signal to the immune system to attack the cancer.
This may be the biggest challenge for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and a type of skin cancer called Mercla cell cancer.
“The enormous importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance, we may be able to reverse this process,” said lead researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-incorporation of markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
“This potentially has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,” said Professor Dawson.
“This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
Maybe we can treat it much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will once be used to treat the cholera’s face tumors, where cancer cells avoid detection in a similar way.
“It is unusual that the exact same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and in the devils),” said Professor Dawson.
“So far, it has been very difficult to treat the tumors of the Kurdistan devils.
But if drugs that work in humans can also be used in the cholera devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease.
Scientists amazed by the fact that a very large planet revolves around a really small star
Scientists express surprise at the discovery of a solar system 30 light years away from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of planet formation processes, because in this system, a large planet similar to Jupiter orbits around a small star called the red dwarf.
An artistic illustration of the gas-type planet GJ 3512b orbiting the central star red dwarf, published on September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets orbiting them.
However, as scientists said Thursday, in this case, the star and planet are slightly different in size.
The size of the star, GJ 3512, is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that orbits it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.
“Yes, this is an absolute surprise,” said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, who led the study published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of the formation of solar systems suggest that low-mass stars usually become stem stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
“In this case, we have discovered a gas-type planet similar to Jupiter orbiting a very small star,” Morales added.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full orbit lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
“That’s why they have red color,” Morales said.
“There is evidence of the existence of a second planet orbiting this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter,” Morales said.
The planets are formed from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which the planets orbit.
According to a leading model of planet formation called the accretion model, the object is initially formed from particles in the disk, and the force of gravity of the planet at an early stage of development allows the atmosphere to be formed from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravity instability model.
“In this case, the protoplanetary disk around a young star may be a bit more massive than we expect and may be cold,” Morales said.
This leads to a disk stability disorder, and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses can rise until they fall and form the planet.
Employee of delicacies accused of filing a co-worker of bean dipu containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion County has stopped the Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, for providing a co-worker of a bean dipu containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Albana Ani Medina-Hernandez was charged with supplying methamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person, both crimes being second-degree crimes.
The lawsuit was filed on 9 September at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In a statement received by OregonLive.com under oath indicating the likelihood of a 27-year-old co-worker from the suspect told Deputy Sheriff Marion that she saw Medina-Hernandez making a bean dip, which she then took part in.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she reported to the investigator, never took methhamphetamines, said that “she thought that one piece she ate was strange, but it didn’t raise any suspicions about it.”
When she got back to work, she felt like she had a stomach mood and she couldn't stop on her feet.
According to Albany Demorat-Herald, she went to a local hospital, where it was established that the bean dip could contain methamphetamine.
According to police reports from The Smoking Gun, another Thriftway employee said Medina-Hernandez had told her that she would add drugs to the food, while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message claiming that methamphetamine had come into the bean dipu by accident.
The OregonLive website informs you of a delicacies monitor that allegedly shows you how backward to the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bra, stands behind the microwave and bends.
Then it simples, wipes the nose, approaches the table and puts the bean dip in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of the bra was probably also on the plate.
Oregon's Statesman-Journal reported that the staff of the Sheriff's Office said there was no suspicion of any contaminated food being given to customers.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County, a fine of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that a woman has already been convicted of assaulting, robbery, identity theft, supplying methamphetamines, stealing, possessing methamphetamines, and possessing illegal weapons.

Marian Banas.
What does KAS do about boss NIK?
Renting a property for the amount below the market price is a reservation that arises in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Mariana Banasia.
We asked what the Treasury is doing about it in the House of Treasury Administration in Krakow and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in a report for Supervisioner TVN raised doubts about the property statements of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
It has been under investigation by the Central Anti-Corruption Office for several months.
The review is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was supposed to rent a house with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65,7 thousand zlotys a year.
The report, “Supervisioner,” revealed that in a tenement rented by him, the hotel was located for hours.
The head of NIK later explained on state television, why he only charged a little more than $5,000 a month for renting the property.
“Gazeta Wyborcza, citing real estate valuation experts, estimated that it should be 15,000 zlotys per month for the building itself.
“The amount was lower for a simple reason: I entered into a preliminary agreement and it was precisely that the tenant had to buy this tenement that made me agree to a lower rent that the remaining debts would be settled on the sale of the tenement house,” Banas said.
However, there have been doubts as to whether such proceedings constitute a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, a spokesperson for the House of Treasury in Krakow, told TVN24 that “the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter.
“All these questions are addressed to the Minister of Finance,” he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases, “the operation is conducted by the National Tax Administration”
The press spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Paweł Jurek admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself monitors a number of issues that may raise reservations.
“The National Tax Administration acts in such a way that it has its own information, as well as in some sense it is based on information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it makes decisions whether to conduct any specific case or not,” an MF spokesperson said.
“In contrast, because we are all in place in the entire finance department, we never speak out, because we cannot speak out in individual matters of a specific taxpayer, a specific person or a specific company,” he said.
Finance Minister Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that \"the tax offices do not communicate this type of information to the public -
“It is known that the entire treasure machine deals with very many similar cases throughout the country,” he said.
The Secrets of the Royal Family: Surprising Visitors Often Flying on a Royal Plane
As part of their duties, members of the royal family during their lives must go on hundreds of trips around the world.
This is usually facilitated by a royal aircraft - a private machine that drives the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.
It is no surprise that having your own aircraft is associated with privileges.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, their limits on the number of luggage, and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests on board - including truly unnoticed.
According to the recently premiered Channel 5 documentary film, not only the Queen and Prince Philip often travel on a royal plane.
During a program titled “Secrets of Royal Flight,” a former Queen’s Flight Navigator revealed that along with the royal family, furry guests were often flying.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes together with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly.
It is not surprising that the Queen could have desired her beloved lovers to accompany her in her travels, because she is known for her deep attachment to the dog corgi.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four-legged creatures and has been hearing that she has been the owner of more than 30 corgi since her coronation.
It is said that in 2007, she had five corgi: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
They were accompanied by five cocker Spaniards: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spana, as well as four dogs that are the cross of the corgi jamer: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The crew of the royal aircraft certainly had their hands full.
A staff member of the Royal House of Dogs was seen and asked to meet their needs before taking them on board the plane, Shields said.
I'm glad to say that there's never been an incident.
The program also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the Queen takes with her on board while traveling in the course of the performance of her duties.
In 1953, the Queen took 12 tons of luggage on her journey of 70,000 kilometers.
In order to be able to display it better, it is about the same as two huge elephants.
However, the Queen is not the only person with a weakness to fashion.
The Duchess of Cambridge also has her own preferences for carrying her wardrobe, it is said that a separate seat is assigned to each of her dresses.
The new law comes into force.
Damaged people will receive rents
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that the victims are seriously injured further payment of the rent, the Financial Ombudsman informs.
This is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the special powers of persons injured in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee amount established on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
This applies to persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At the time, they were significantly lower than the current guarantee amounts, so in some cases the insurers have already stopped paying the rent.
“I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been seeking for many years to create a mechanism that will allow the seriously injured to guarantee financial support from the insurance of the OC or the OC of the farmer, despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount,” says Aleksander Daszewski, a legal adviser at the office of the Financial Ombudsman.
In the opinion of the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary, because it was often very tragic situations concerning people in a very poor state of health who, due to the accident, cannot work, for example, and at the same time bear significant costs of post-accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them were no longer profitable and for increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sum on the OC policies.
This was a threat in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the insurer’s liability limits were significantly lower than current ones.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years most often affected people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were very low, and the economic conditions resulted in an increase in prices.
“We also noticed that this problem also affected a number of young people who suffered damage during the period when the amount of the sum was EUR 350 000 for each injured person in the accident.
Currently, it is EUR 5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of victims.
Therefore, this is a huge difference in relation to earlier periods, so the problem required legislative intervention,” recalls Alexander Daszewski.
It explains that due to the fact that the guarantee amount is increased at some time, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of the liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount applicable at the time when the pension claim is addressed to the Fund.
This principle applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the pension on the basis of a judgment of the court determining the amount of the guarantee amount other than that set out in the OC insurance contract.
This is the case in case of an increase in the guarantee amount on the basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for modification of the existing compulsory relationship.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to people who in the past have asked us to intervene.
We inform them of new permissions and, of course, we ensure that we can provide further support in case of any problems arise,” says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brandon Barattini convicted of cutting off a boy's penis
The case concerns events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, at that time it was Brenda Barattini who found out that her boyfriend showed friends the sextasm that originated in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect of education, explained before the court that the partner had thus ruined her life and treated her as a “trophy” to boast of her friends.
“He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything, he argued.
Cordoby's family decided to measure justice.
She invited her boyfriend, a 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him that she had prepared a special surprise.
By means of a Velvet belt, she shrugged his eyes, and then caught a sector and cut off his penis.
“I felt like I was supposed to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pull up my pants, and I caught my cell phone to call the ambulances,\" the injured man said.
“I wanted to leave, but she started to insult me.
She took me for a shirt and hair, not allowing me to leave,” he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing a sextam, she didn’t try to escape responsibility.
“I ask justice,” she said to the jury.
She was ultimately found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama Congressman Jack Edwards Died at 91
On Friday, Alabama’s retired Congressman Jack Edwards, who served for 10 term and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The family spokesperson said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from the state of Alabama in the Deep South due to the fact that the party gained support here.
He served 10 days in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return kindness.
“I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where the common debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country will return kindness,” Edwards said.
Alabama State Governor Kay Ivey said that Edwards served her as and domestically with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that, in his honor of the flag on the State of Alabama, they would be abandoned by half of the mast.
“He was the personification of a real state official and was the best state husband for Alabama.
“Our state has lost one of the most outstanding politicians,” Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle \"inspiration\" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Duchess Sussex “a caring leader who breaks schemes and makes our world better.”
Princess and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Archae Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with the young people at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
“I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @ssexroyal, “a caring leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better,” she wrote in her enthusiastic post.
“Whether meeting the leaders of the Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation or helping girls around the world access the education they deserve is an inspiration to many people,” Obama added, posting a photo depicting the smiling Meghan who poses with the foundation’s leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for British Vogue’s September release, guest-edited by former actress of “Suits”
In a sincere conversation, she was the first lady to talk about motherhood and how she changed it.
“Being a mother means bringing the art of forgiveness to the championship,” Obama said in an interview.
“Motherhood has taught me that most of the time it is my job to give children space so that they can know the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in the heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being in a candlestick, shared with the Duchess during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
\"The pressure you feel - imposed by yourself and others - can sometimes overwhelm you,\" she said.
“My advice is to slow down and not rush.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were doing well at school and making new friends before I was dedicated to more ambitious work.
I think it's also necessary.
Hotel Trump retains permission to sell alcohol despite complaints about the owner's disposition
WASHINGTON (AP) - Washington's Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission has made a request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its permission to sell alcohol due to the owner's disposition.
The agency ordered Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is groundless, since most of them do not live in the district or have real estate in it.
\"The Washington Post - reports that for the second time these reasons have sought to withdraw the hotel's permission to sell alcohol, citing a provision in force in the district saying that applicants for an alcohol licence must be \"good disposition\" -
In an initial complaint filed last summer, it was found that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, citing allegations of assault and repeated cases of fraud.
The complaint was delayed because the permit was granted before it was filed.
The reason for the second complaint was to extend the authorisation.
“The Sun: A crushing report recognizes Cleveland police scandal as the worst in the UK
The inspectors found the UK’s worst-ever SCANDALS to be the worst.
In a crushing report, they assessed the police work in Cleveland as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, the Chief Inspectorate of the Police of Her Majesty, said that there was “significant deterioration” in the police services in Cleveland.
There were new calls for solutions to police services, which were headed by five commanders over the course of six years.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley, of the Chief Inspectorate of the Police of Her Majesty, said: \"Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards -
Vice-President Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into “serious, but undisclosed, allegations about his actions.”
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was suspended after the arrest on charges of gross failures.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood presented himself to the commission on crimes for contributing his colleagues to sexual activities.
He left the service.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “This is an official confirmation that these services are being compromised.

We have a skatepark visualization!
Are the young finally waiting?
Older residents are disturbed by young enthusiasts driving on hulajnogs and skateboards, and they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Olav.
For years, young people have been reminded of the place to ride on rollers, skateboards, hulajnogas, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our fractures.
We have been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Recently, there was a loud voice about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to this again and we're asking in the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago a woman was called, who was disturbed by the young people driving in the center.
“I write on behalf of the residents of the bloc at Pł. Piłsudski so that the situation of the Austrian youth can be interested,” Małgorzata writes.
“The residents of the bloc have repeatedly called the City Guard ineffectively.
For proof of such everyday situations, I submit photos -
We asked others about this.
Most say that young people simply have nowhere to ride in the city and for years they have been ineffectively demanding places for themselves.
There was a huge commentary on Facebook.
In July, we wrote that there was a chance that the skatepark would be built on the city of Olaw.
The mayor said the city had requested funding for the construction of a skateboard park.
“The project, which is consulted with young people, is ready with the permits.
On 28 March, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding the task entitled «Skatepark building in Oław» under the Sportowa Polska programme - we were told in the office.
Total value of the project: 798 306.00 zł.
The requested amount of funding: 263 440,00 PLN.
Now we asked again at what stage the matter is.
“We do not yet have information about the resolutions made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism,” says Elizabeth Bednarczyk, head of the Faculty of European Funds UM Oława.
“The information obtained from the Ministry’s staff shows that in the end, the selection of all tasks under the Sports Poland Programme should take place in October,” he said.
We also asked for a visualisation of the Austrian skatepark.
We present it below.
The young man told the editors that on Saturday (September 28th) they would collect signatures under a petition concerning the construction of a skateboard park in Oław.
“The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a collection,” Mikołaj wrote.
The petition signatures will be collected from 12.00 am around the Lidl market.
2019/20 Polish Cup: draw 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit years ago
It was one of the hottest competitions in the extraclass.
The biggest legend was a memorable match from the 1996/1997 season.
On 18 June 1997, Legia took part at the old stadium in Łazienko’s Łódź team in the last line.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, the second in a row the Polish Championship gave the point.
In the 87th minute, Legia led 2:0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake - Videw shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
Over the years, the boat club fell into increasing troubles until it stopped counting on the championship and fell from the highest class of gameplay.
For the last time, the two teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia, on the way to the title, had two victories - 5:1 at home and 1:0 at the exit.
Back to the Elite
Today, the boats are fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans have been delayed for at least a year since in previous games, being one of the favorites, they have failed to advance to the background of the extraclass.
As a result of the failure of summer, there was a personal revolution at the club.
The authorities have changed, they have finally been placed on coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy they are going to help them in the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możzen.
For now, Widew is fourth in the table II of the league, but in the Polish Cup he defeated on Tuesday the vice-president of the Śląsk Wrocław 2:0.
In the same size, the Legion played on the exit of the Nepołomice Desert.
Extraclass Startups
The only pair composed of top-class representatives in 1/16 of the final is made up of her biennials LKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place on October 29-31.
This year, the 1-8 finals were scheduled to be played (3-5 December).
The final will be held on 2 May at PGE National in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “rebellished” and the impeachment investigation must be on track
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are taking part in an attempt to hide the facts of an attempt to hide facts, and the investigation may take place,” Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on the Chapter Hill.
“They are doing the work they started by keeping to the facts and time necessary to find them,” she added.
The White House protocol shows that Trump asked Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenski to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Red Giuliani, according to the protocol.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice reported a complaint about Trump’s case involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal report.
After receiving a complaint as a report from officials at the Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice stated that the Trump intervention interview did not provide a criminal investigation into campaign funding.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call a witness.
But she added that, in her opinion, Barr \"has rebelled -
This state has been going on for a long time.
\"Although (Barra) is mentioned in all this,\" Pelosi added, referring to Trump's reference to his attorney general during a July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he made decisions on how to consider the complaint.
Pelosi said she was “very afraid” of the signaling information Trump had attacked on Thursday as a spy, suggesting that in the past it was otherwise done with the spy.
I think the President's words go beyond irresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our whistleblowers play an important role in discovering - revealing offences in our government - said Pelosi, adding \"The President's words about people who can provide information are seriously undermining the honesty of the government -
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step in the announcement of a formal investigation into committing an unlawful act based on allegations of attempts to pressure the leader of a foreign state in order to gain political benefits.
A telephony conversation included in a complaint published Thursday claiming that Trump had abused his power to “incline Ukraine to intervene - during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signator also accused the White House lawyers of telling officials to remove the recording of the conversation from the computer system, where it is stored for the needs of officials of the Council of Ministers, and put it in a system designed for sensitive information.

A possible ban on driving at excessive speed for the Crystal Palace attacker Christiana Benteke
The Premier League star Christian Benteke, who has been caught twice at speed in the last two months, is threatened with a ban on driving.
Crystal Palace, 28 years old, admitted to driving the Bentley brand at 80 miles an hour in the area, limited to 50 miles an hour on the A3 road in Richmond, South-West London on January 20.
Then, in March, the photoradars in Putney, South-West London, registered a Belgian driving at 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentke from Kingston Hill of Surrey does not have to be in the Court of Peace this morning at Lavender Hill.
He admitted to both offences at the beginning of July under a simplified procedure, on the basis of which the crimes of the lighter are judged at a meeting held by a single judge of the room.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of Sekondi Hasaacas, has raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Association in Ghana (GFA).
He called into question the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Daisy, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be fair because the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral outsiders who have no links with any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Daisy employed NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for 10 percent payment.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympics.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because he has an interest in it.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, the Director of the Olympic Games, were to stand before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President on account of his association with the club, suggesting that if Palmer was to come before the Commission, he would be prejudiced and biased.
According to expectations, the Commission’s members were expected to start work from yesterday, after the oath at the GFA Secretariat ceremony in Akra on Tuesday, September 19, and finish on October 4.
The President of the Commission is Frank Daisy, and its members are the Corporate Order Consultant and the lawyer Marian Barnor and Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the unity government
Israel’s two main parties, the Blue-White Alliance and Likud, continued on Friday negotiations on the establishment of a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the President entrusted the mission of forming government to Benjamin Netanyahu, failed to produce results.
The talks considered the possibility of a rotating leadership of both parties in the government and the remain of Netanyahu as prime minister, but, according to the Israeli daily Haarec, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of the Blue-Whites announced in a statement that it had presented preliminary demands.
Likud’s right-wing accusation that he “deployed himself in his positions, demanding that his leader and previous Prime Minister Netanyahu remain at the forefront of the government, and in the composition of the cabinet, a former ultra-orthodox politician.
“From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue-Whites would not agree to these conditions,” they said in a statement.
For Likud, acting solely in Netanyahu's interest, wants to \"lead Israel to the second round of elections\"
Blue-and-White leader Benny Gantz refuses to support the government he would have led until he is charged with taking part in three corruption cases, on the basis of which the prosecutor could formally charge him after a meeting on Wednesday.
“Likud and Blue-Biali have achieved a sufficient majority in the 17 September elections that would allow them to join governments as natural allies, but this will force them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted,” EFE said.
President Reuwen Rivlin tried to bring their positions in recent days and proposed the appointment of a “rotative government”, suggesting that the prime minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take this position if charges against Netanyahu were held and formalized.
There are no Israeli analysts who think things have stuck in a blind corner.
However, half of Israelis, according to a poll published by public television on Friday, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing a government of unity under a rotating leadership in the turn of Netanyahu and Gantz.
50.6% of Israelis support this solution, 32.1% of those surveyed object to such a solution.
The poll shows a deep division in the Israeli society - the question of who should be the first to lead the cabinet, 41.8% of respondents support Netanyahu, and 40% support Gantz.
In another poll published by Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government is up 63%, 60% opposed to the new elections that would be the third one this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on September 17, he won the Gantz alliance, winning 33 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu, with its traditional and potential allies, can count on the support of 55 MPs, while Gantz is 54.
None of the parties collected 61 mandates, which were necessary to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight against the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says, “It’s time to check out, when Wales is facing the final game with Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
Wales’s victory over the “kangaroos” would place this team as a favorite for winning Group D and guarantee a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be immediately sent back at the start of England as part of the eighth final.
“Let’s make it clear, both teams want to try to go through this and be at the forefront of the group,” said the Welsh ravage Tipuric.
In the past there were some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they will be eagerly trying to take this victory away from us, and we necessarily want to bring it back again.
Before we got here, you knew it was going to be a big start.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check.
Wales won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa in the history of the World Cup - and it took place 32 years ago in a third place match when they defeated \"kangaroos\"
And their overall record under the leadership of Warren Gatland’s chief coach shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams from the southern hemisphere.
Wales stopped the string of thirteen lost test matches from Australia in November last year, and Tipuric was prepared to be among the few survivors of this 9-6 win who will run to the stadium in Tokyo on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether before this victory the team experienced a mental blockage, he added: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so leveled that maybe... people expect a certain mental blockage to occur, I don't know.
After all, in the last match, we probably left about 15 points on the pitch, so the final score looks a lot smaller than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then Tipurica’s fight against the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the mill by Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and downfall will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the representation colours and met with both players on several earlier occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
“They are players playing the seventh position of an absolutely world class,” he said.
When playing against world-class third-line mill players, it is always known that there will be a difficult match to play.
The two are always with the best players in the world.
You know what games to expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world to play defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels better rugby because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and challenge yourself than to face the third line of the mill, which is not so good.
It is worth playing against the best, and when struggling with these two, you must definitely be in top form.
I would not say that on Sunday there will be almost a final of the cup, but for us it is an important match in this World Cup.
Impet is an important element of it.
When we build strength and constantly put great effort, we will fly like on the wings and it will be hard to beat us.

-Waffen-SS - Johan Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were meant to be the elite organization of the \"man race\"
They took in the ranks of those they despised.
Can crime unite more strongly than national identity?
In your hands, we don’t give another book on war or military issues.
We offer a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
The historians from different European countries analyze the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish troops differ from the French?
Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn’t we create a branch of the Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative on collaboration in individual European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war?
Among other things, the book Waffen-SS answers these questions, based on solid research material.
We sought to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer picture of collaboration in Europe during World War II, also attempting to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and the given period of history by presenting a report by researchers from different countries. (...) If the fates of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavic population - are sometimes presented in comparative and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are essentially examined from a national perspective (as far as this is done).
\"Total panic - when the White House is struggling to find arguments about the impeachment
White House officials are going to be soaking up to figure out how to reject the renewed pressures on the impeachment on Thursday, and one of the speakers familiar with the situation is describing the feeling of “total panic” felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
This seems to increase “anxiety, uncertainty, and fear”, one of the White House-related people describes in this way the mood in the Western wing, that the claims of the whistleblower could seriously harm the president and the people around him.
The person said, “There is little certainty that nothing is hidden there.”
The White House officials were still unsure of how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods of effectively avoiding the controversy used by the president in the past may not work.
Another person who knew the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as “a state of shock”, accompanied by an increasing distrust that, along with an ongoing investigation into the impeachment, the likelihood of the president responding irresponsibly and becoming “difficult to master.”
This concern is shared by another spokesperson claiming that people around the president predict that they will show more “distinctive behavior” and that the pressure on him will certainly begin to increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behavior and an unexpected explosion - in the context of the election year, it is a concern both from the perspective of the presidency and the elections.
Faced with the biggest threat in the presidency so far, Trump has been circling from attack to defense, once again reaching for a strategy he has assessed as effective in the investigation into Russia by Robert Mueller.
He tried to stifle his own request to the Ukrainian president for assistance in investigating his political rivals to draw attention and direct her to the actions of Democrats and Democratic candidate Joe Biden and discredit the whistleblower as guided by party incentives.
But while many people in the White House are involved in the fight after Mueller’s investigation, this time something has changed, the consultants and consultants said.
The president, whose hallmark is strength, the Wednesday press conference has proved to be defeated,” one of the people familiar with the situation said.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some of the President’s allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them stick to the fact that the informer had no first-hand knowledge of the aforementioned controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenski, which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as it often happens, when the president is the object of attacks, this fact is alive raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategists associated with the White House points out that the results of the polls of support for the president are unnoticedly high, and the impeachment will not affect too much the acquisition of new sympathizers.
“There is no positive need to focus on the President’s impeachm in the next four months, especially if this hinders his legislative programme and prevails in the new series of news headlines.
Another spokesperson says those who maintained the impeachment would help the president not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Worried White House officials sought help from advisers by completing an impeachment response team.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it remains unclear whether any initiative in the style of the command center will be taken and what form it can take.
This person has declared that there is a belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a determined leader capable of carrying out a PR attack which is a rival to the publication of a synonymous signal report and aimed at halting the flow of democratic action on the impeachment given by the disclosure of that report.
A spokesperson familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin declared that they had no intention to reveal a note describing Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it could be felt that there was no way out and a document had to be published.
It is expected that now the pressure will be greater than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who mostly kept silence and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who could be involved in developing a response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty Trump robot and a former head of the election staff,” said the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandowski said in an interview with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will direct this action.
“For the last five years, I’ve done everything I could to support the president and his program,” he said, “but I didn’t have any conversations with the president or his team about joining the team to back up the false narrative about the impeachment.”
Donald Trump’s private lawyer from Mueller’s investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment activities.
“We respond to cases as they should,” Sekulow replied when asked by NBC News for a comment.
Currently, the White House feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton’s impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller’s investigation, left, and the current adviser, Pat Cipillone, had no such experience.
The White House spokesperson said that in general, officials did not plan to involve people or create a command center at any time, but admitted that there was a need for a coordinated, joint response and a person who could lead a political struggle.

Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding “deep photos of Trump.”
Congressman Devin Nunes, a state of California, apparently cannot bear the naked truth that an investigation is ongoing on President Donald Trump.
In his defense on Thursday, he accused the Democrats of wanting to get naked pictures of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives’ Intelligence Commission, filed the above allegation during a preliminary hearing as a result of a complaint by a signalist, as if Trump had asked Ukraine to assist in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal “a grotesque show, the left and their “media asem,” before saying that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the negligene.
“Democrats in this committee were negotiating with the people they thought were Ukrainians to get the naked photos of Trump,” Nunes said.
“People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to put the president in a state of accusation when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished giving reprimends, HuffPost’s political reporter Jennifer Bendery decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to discover it.
Only Connecticut representative Jim Himes replied so far, although we suspect his answer is a naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com portal suspects that Nunes’s comments about nudity were referring to “certain more deplorable and unconfirmed information” that is likely to appear in the controversial acts of Steele,
It is celebrated, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele, a collection of allegations against Trump, indicating the likelihood of a tape that shows him watching the urine of a prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research into renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be to escape renewable energy - aircraft.
However, Alberta University professor has developed a technology that allows renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University at the Department of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Environment, which began working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fat waste, such as restaurant fat, animal fat, and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during production, which is estimated to result in 85% lower carbon emissions than diesel fuels, as well as use waste from other industries in the process.
This technology is designed to imitate the hydrocarbons present in diesel fuels.
“What our first generation technology has done,” Bressler said, “is [in total] a hydrocarbons that are identical molecules like diesel fuel.”
While this opens up a new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuel products have been characterised by a tendency to destabilize at lower temperatures, which poses a serious threat for high-rise aircraft.
“The problem with aviation fuel is a bit of a wrong wheel,” Bressler said.
It is actually less valuable than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler’s laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
“We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit,” Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company created by Alberta University, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercializing the product, as airlines, as well as Canadian and American armies, are increasing investment in the renewable option.
“They are able to imagine the times in which the situation may be reversed and carbon tax will be imposed on them,” he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be an emergency plan.
Currently, Forge runs a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and has recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment aimed at supporting a $25 million production facility that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the expected carbon reduction will be about 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production are preventing further carbon reductions.
“As a technology specialist,” Bressler said.
I have the task of developing options that enable conscious decisions and many options to be chosen.
ANSWER: Another fraud for your grandson
8,000 zlotys and 750 euros lost the resident of Zamościa thinking he was helping his grandson who caused the accident.
Police reported the incident on Thursday, the son of a fraudulent assault.
“The woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he'll go to prison.
In order to help her grandson, she handed over 8,000 zlotys and 750 euros to a false police officer who came to her house, says Dorota Krukowska-Bubil from the Zamok police.
Police are looking for perpetrators and are once again appealing for caution:
“Every call with a request for financial assistance should be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion and in a hurry.
Let us remember that the police do not ask for money and do not accept money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support that will raise our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's tell you how fraudsters work.
Please be careful and not trust the people who call and ask for a loan.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ally warns that in the event of the withdrawal of Brexit in the UK, there is a threat of death, such as in Los Angeles, and he calls for peace of mind.
One of the main ministers of the cabinet said last night that the country is threatening to \"violent social damage - if the original result is questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
The allies of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from his immediate surroundings warned that national concerns were threatened by social unrest on the scale of protests of “yellow vests” in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for \"satisfaction of moods - during a turbulent argument about the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word \"submission\"
Despite his appeal for peace of mind, the cabinet minister said, “The Times,” “There have never been protests in this country like the “gilets jaunes” demonstrations, or the “yellow vests” in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example - gilets jaunes - using encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate pikets, and to push people to protest enough unkind populist leaders.
Residents in Los Angeles broke out after the jury absolved four white policemen who beat black taxi driver Jeffrey King in 1992.
This year, anti-government protesters in France wearing yellow reflective vests - the jaunes gilet - have been empty for more than six weeks and are devastation the streets of Paris.
The minister referred to Johnson’s warning in the House of Commons and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there would be a “catastrophic loss of trust in our political system.”
“If we hold a referendum with 30 million people voting and 66% of them agree to remain in the European Union, ten million people will remain dissatisfied,” he said.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not forgive.
A lot of you don’t need to see a few tens of thousands of people on the street soon.
One of the main ministers of the cabinet added that the country is at risk of \"violent social damage - if the result of the first referendum is questioned by the outcome of the other.
Johnson called for universal elections in which voters should decide on the fate of Brexit.
According to reports, the Prime Minister is facing the risk of a cabinet rebellion seeking to reduce Brexit demands and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
Holovnia, Czubówna and Krosna were delighted in Krakow.
Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (26 September) to 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including Simon Holownia, Krystyna Czubovna and Irenaeus Krosna.
This is all within the framework of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expansion of horizons, discussions on ideas worthy of publicity, and common discussions that can become an impulse for further development.
Such a goal was set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 unique speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among them people known from the media - Szymon Holovna, Krystina Czubovna and Irena Krosny.
The motto of this year's Talk'N'Roll was \"Crafting the Future, NOW\" and it was around the creation of the future that the guests invited to attend the conference focused.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who discussed how the brand that is being built around him can have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went on stage to change the audience’s perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted if the future is to be created, while Chris Badura took on the issue of empathy in the era of rapid technology development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help you manage your career and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-threaded conversation with Krystina Czubovna, who discussed among other things how the profession of a lecturer in Poland changed from her perspective over the years.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that, thanks to the development of technology, today everyone can struggle with this profession.
However, he does not think that in the coming years a person in the position of a lecturer should be completely replaced by technology.
Just after her, Piotr Nabielec took on the problem of life during the time of informational, emotional overload or overload in the matter of choice, giving the public valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętocha in his speech talked about what another industrial revolution, known as \"Industry 4.0\" could lead to.
Having fun teaching, teaching fun
The organizers of the conference also took care of the artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist Daniel Oneak to the scene.
The third part of the conference, in turn, opened Irenaeus Krosna, who first played the audience with pantonima, and then, on the example of his own career, he discussed how he was trying to maintain the right balance between career on stage and private life.
The participants were also kidnapped by Szymon Hłownia, emphasizing the role of time in our lives.
The publicist noted that even two minutes can diametrically change the situation and need to be ready to take advantage of this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared his thoughts on the reality surrounding us, calling for anecdotes that could cause a smile on the faces of the viewers.
Then, Adrian Tvoruszka appeared on the stage, who reviewed the history and goals of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Słowiak, on the example of Rubik's cube, talked about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly contributed something new to the perception of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to watch performances, and the natural reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to a great involvement from the audience.
The organizers provided a transmission for all those who could not personally participate in the event, and recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
“Despite the lack of enough votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of three-folding power,” the Helsinki Foundation of Human Rights said in a report published Thursday.
The report, “The rule of law instead of the rule of law,” documents, among other things, changes in the rule of justice and in the area of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled “The Governments of Law instead of the rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland 2015-2019
The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019, the largest human rights regression in Poland was recorded after 1989.
“Despite the lack of enough votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of the division of power.
By adapting the right to political purposes, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law, HFPC experts write.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the area of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedoms of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes the dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.
“In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the exercise of the right to pursue particular party interests.
This has been translated into a ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as a weakening of the entire system of protection of human rights in Poland,” said Marcin Freeny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As stated in the report, the last four years have been \"a period of systemic change both in the country and in the area of human rights.\"
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 key acts for the protection of human rights.
“The changes were often adopted at a rapid pace, without public consultation and despite the objections of legal settings, the Ombudsman or international organisations,” said Małgorzata Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main tendencies observed over the last four years are: “the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the non-respect of binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions, and the weakening of the guarantee of the protection of human rights.”
The authorities of the State have not notified
The Helsinki Foundation of Human Affairs found it “those situations in which the authorities of the state have not responded or have disregarded the emerging cases of aggression.”
The Foundation experts noted that some changes were made to the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the state’s activities in the field of limiting the rule of law is an ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law entities.
“The absence of these recommendations not only weakens Poland’s position as a leader in democratic changes in the Central and Eastern Europe region, but also puts the Polish state at risk of being responsible for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights,” the report said.
Brother of Pakistan's social media star with lifetime for honorary murder
Women's rights experts argue that the investigation of justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected murderers for bailing and the curtailment of matters in public awareness.
“It takes so long for people to forget,” says Farzana Bari, a women’s rights defender and founder of Pakistan’s first gender study department, and adds that even a widely reported case of Baloch murder has been resolved for more than three years.
Although reliable data is difficult to determine, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 found at least 300 cases of so-called honorable killings.
Many activists say that the actual number is much higher, and a network that promotes awareness of honorable crimes estimates that there are about one-fifth of the 5,000 honorary murders committed every year worldwide in Pakistan.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, the transfers to the country are decreasing, as many emigrants are sitting outside Poland permanently, according to the “Rzeczpospolita” Friday.
According to the latest Euro-Tax report, the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries in 2018 amounted to more than 8.6 thousand zlotys, which means that almost a thousand zlotys increased, i.e. almost 12%.
Euro-Tax estimates that the total income of Polish earners in the EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one more than a year earlier.
The director of the Centre for Migration Studies at the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Poles are getting better at the international labour market, where they use various options available.
“The number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of ever better conditions, as well as international corporations,” the newspaper said.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries throughout the year, such as the UK and Germany.
“This is the most significant in 2018, because by 11%, the total earnings of Polish emigrants (up to almost PLN 27 billion) increased.
However, the most Polish people on the islands - almost PLN 35 billion - are still making the most of it.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite improving working conditions on the Polish market, the number of migrant earners does not decrease.
In fact, still saxes in the West and North of Europe (head of Norway) are often opportunities for several times higher earnings than in Poland.
“And even at the minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, in Germany amount to 9.5 to 11.7 euros per hour,” the daily reports.
“The Rzeczpospolita,” he said, “says that Poles are not only left because of higher earnings, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles have found their roots abroad, which can also be seen after decreasing transfers of money to the country.
Last year was the lowest in years.
As economist Tadeusz Chroscicki reminds us, with the extension of the period of stay abroad, a group of people transferring money to the country decreases their height.
“Emigrants draw close to each other,” the statement reads on Friday.
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended by almost a month, and the unexpected rainfall causes death due to the decline of buildings and the gnash of many crops.
Usually, in northern India, monsoons go back to early September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Department of Meteorology, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the final monsoon for decades at the latest.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unprecedented - recently in the west of India, cities of Pune Wednesday and Thursday rains have led to the death of several people and devastation due to the collapse of buildings.
Houses were flooded, people were defending the streets in the water on their knees, which normally happens only during the monsoon apogee.
Large rainfall also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of long-term rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses have been destroyed.
Monsun also started with a delay.
In many areas there was a lack of water, so farmers were preparing for a likely drought.
Too long-lasting monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
\"Through him, my vegetables - and now I have cabbage, beans, grapes and tomatoes - will rot,\" says Prakash Mehra, a small farm farmer at Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the influence of a delayed and late ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, i.e. an indispensable component of Indian dishes.
Onion, for which it was usually necessary to pay 20 rupees (0.23 U.K. pound), currently costs 80 rupees (about 1 U.K. pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another big festival is Dasar’s feast on October 8, during which Hindus rise huge cuddles like from a comic book depicting Ravana, a figure with a lush ligament and a sinister smile from the epic “Ramajana”
Smoking Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that the similarities of Ravana were made of paper, if the monsoon continues, it is Ravana who will laugh last.

Doodle celebrates 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we are looking for answers to all the questions we are concerned with.
What are we looking for in Google?
\"What it is,\" \"Where,\" \"How\" and \"How many\" are some of the favorite categories searched by Poles.
The giant’s data shows that last year we were happy to ask, among others, where there is a storm, “How to make asparagus,” and “How many fingers has a horse,” “How to get rid of fruit fly,” “How to eat cocoa.”
Today, the search engine celebrates its 20th birthday.
Its users, and 96% of people in Poland use Google’s “uncle”, today welcome Google’s special Doodle.
This time he's not animated.
Google reminds of its birthdays, showing a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the bottom right, digital date was printed - as in the picture of the 90s.
Catalog information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose - it was supposed to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It is derived from the mathematical term googol, meaning the number of ten raised to the power of a hundred.
This name was also intended to reflect the company’s intention to fill as many pages from global Internet resources as possible.
Google was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which acted better than the methods of ordinary segregation of results based on the frequency of the phrase.
At first, the search engine was named BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon thereafter launched the famous Google.com website today.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, in the “PC Magazine”, information appears about the extremely high accuracy of Google search results.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with every month, conquering new markets and increasing the company's value.
As early as June 2000, Google’s URL index has more than a billion entries, making Page and Brin’s work the world’s largest search engine.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players on the IT market.
Is there another field for development?
“Google’s mission is to organize world-wide information resources to be widely available and useful, even though we have made huge progress in this field, it is still a long way ahead to achieve this goal,” said Piotr Zaleewski of Google Poland.
Frequent contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that working with exposure to plant protection products at a high concentration may translate into a high risk of heart disease in later years of life.
This was the case for a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii who have been under investigation for more than 30 years.
The researchers found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the most contact with them were 45% more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
“This study highlights the need to use personal protection equipment for the time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of registering in medical records with such means at work, as well as controlling the standard factors that increase heart disease maturity,” study co-author Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez said.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the district of Manoa.
The results were based on data from more than 6,000 men on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu cardiovascular program.
According to the researchers, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, because it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life of decay, so the effects of their effects on health can make them known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez said: “After 34 years of men’s observation, the link between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant.
This was probably because the factors associated with aging were more important, which masked the possible cause-effect relationships between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in later years of life.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelenski-Trump spokesperson: Poroshenko adds his three cents
Washington’s policy has a turbulent week to begin impeachment against U.S. President Donald Trump
Getting involved in a political scandal is for the political debuter Volodymyr Zelenski a situation he would rather avoid.
But what do we really know about Zelensky-Trump and will it have far-reaching effects on the first one?
Almost at the beginning of the telephone call, Trump told Zelensk that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, they detail Trump’s attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that German leaders, together with other European leaders, are engaged in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
The controversy raised Zelenski’s response, which said he agreed with Trump not 100% but 1000%.
Zelensky added that both French President Macron and Merkel are not enough to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, decide to vote through social networks.
Petro Poroshenko, the former president of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU’s support “was unprecedented.”
In other tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the “Russian aggression” that included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including the Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now?”
Trump then referred to military assistance and asked Zelenski for investigation not in one and two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and the other referring to the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on Democrats' email boxes during the 2016 election.
It is not known whether it will describe European relations or cause relations with the leader of France and Germany to be broken.
I don't want to talk wrong about anyone...
“Thank you to all of us,” Zelenski said at the UN General Assembly.
Zelensky is expected to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the “Normanic Four”, which will take place in October.
Former provincial inspector legally acquitted
The court cleared Jerzy Wisniewski of his actions.
After six years, Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court in Przemysl cleared Jerzy Wisniewski, the former head of the Regional Trade Quality Inspectorate of Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszow, on charges of exceeding powers.
Lubelsk’s prosecutor’s office accused him of betraying the then Marshal of the province’s term of inspection at a food oil plant.
Recently, there has been a legal acquittal in this case.
The appeal was recognized on September 12.
“The court maintained the acquittal sentence in force,” says Judge Małgorzata Reizer, spokesperson for the District Court in Przemysl.
It is a judgment of 14 February 2014 issued by the District Court in Przemysl.
Jerzy Wisniewski commented on Facebook: “It’s been six years since I was presented to me by the Appeal Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin with the charge of allegedly breaking the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Province on April 30, 2012.
The court clearly stated that I was innocent and did not break the law at the time.
I was convinced that at that time my conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Province was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of the events that the public media outlined in 2013 by the Appeals Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin passed with the truth and caused irreparable damage both to the food producer’s entrepreneur and to the loss of my person’s image among my employers, employees and the local community.
The act of accusation, which was drawn up against me in the opinion of the Court of Justice, contained a number of errors, false facts, unreliable definitions of the legal basis, unconfirmed in fact of the events.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was immediately fired from work and deprived of funds.
I have stayed for a long time to maintain my husband,
Let's remind you.
Jerzy Wisniewski was a regional trade quality inspector of agri-food products from 2009 to 2013.
He was dismissed from office after the prosecutor’s office in Lublin filed charges in 2013.
According to investigators, in a telephone conversation he was to betray the then Marshal of the province (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the term of control at a food oil plant belonging to the wife of the then vice-marszał podkarpackie.
This warning, as the prosecutors from Lublin said, was meant to make the company owner know about the controls and correct the labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard allegations of overrun, for which he was threatened by up to three years of imprisonment.
“I feel relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of a valid sentence absolving me from my charges,” says Jerzy Wisniewski.
The White House tried to hide the recording of the conversation with Zelenski
In a report released on Thursday, the signaling officer wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski, sought to intervene the foreign state in the US elections, and the White House tried to hide the record of the conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated August 12, a whistleblower who is probably an intelligence worker, he wrote: “As part of my duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his function to demand foreign interference in the 2020 election in the United States.
“Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to realize his own interests.
In fact, he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president re-election in 2020, according to a report cited by The Hill.
The Ukrainian leader “was made to understand that relations with Trump depended on whether “will show will to take the game” in matters that President Ruda Giuliani’s lawyer should have told him in more detail.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but emphasizes that he was informed in detail about its content by “many White House officials who had direct information about it” and their relations covered.
“The following days after this conversation, I learned from many U.S. officials that high-ranking representatives of the White House had intervened to “plom” all the archival records concerning this conversation, and especially the literal record that was drawn up, as it is usually done, in the White House crisis room,” he said.
“High ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers had “ordered them” to remove electronic records from the information system in which such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information,” the author wrote.
“In my opinion, these steps show that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation,” he said.
As the AP said, this document will probably speed up proceedings on the possible impeachment of the president, and also contain valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
After the pressures of Congress, he made the interview with the Zelensky White House available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationships of the people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, edited in the version, was revealed on the day after that by the House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee.
On Thursday, Joseph Maguire, the head of the American intelligence, testified to the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee and explained how he had treated the intelligence worker’s report.
Maguire said that the signal player made the right choice and acted as ordered by law.
He also stressed that, in his opinion, the matter of talking with Zelenski is an event \"without precedent -
The Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release of a signal report to Congress; the intelligence director said he had no authority to reveal his content, whose confidential character was guaranteed by the so-called power of the executive.
Part of Maguire’s hearing by the committee was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, House of Representatives President Nancy Pelosi announced that in view of the suspicion that the president had pressured the authorities of Ukraine to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives launches an investigation that could lead to Trump’s impeachment.
A day later, Trump and Zelenski reported that the U.S. president had broken election and security standards.
U.S. electoral law prohibits the use of assistance from foreign countries.
On Thursday, White House spokesperson Stephan Grisham said there was “no harm in the conversation,” and in the report “there is nothing more than a set of third-hand and gluttish press cuts together.”
“The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and the false narrative promoted by mainstream media,” she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded in evidence that Ghana had achieved the highest number of air safety surveillance points in Africa, i.e. 89.89% of the temporary rate of effective implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Safety Audit Programme.
The protection award was a proof of the country’s high commitment to the implementation of the standards and protocols recommended by ICAO at airports and in the airspace of Ghana.
The award programme has been developed to support ICAO’s No Country Left Behind initiative.
In addition, the ICAO Member States, which have improved their safety and protection standards, have been granted 16 other certificates in the field of security and 17 in the field of protection.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, CEO of Ghana’s Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain safety in the airspace by the Member States.
He said, “It is important that we constantly remind ourselves that even in the era of innovation, aviation safety and sustainability must remain our core priorities.”
On his part, Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the state’s efforts, because they are a compliment to the hard work and perseverance of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential to develop the country’s economy, saying “aircraft has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything is due to the security and security we have achieved.
WAY: He danced and fled, he also stole a bicycle
A 50-year-old from the municipality of Zamość drove his audi under the distributor, tanked and left without paying.
He stole gas stations several times.
A month ago, a man also stole a bicycle from one of the local authorities.
The owners of gas stations valued losses of almost 1,000 PLN.
Owner of the stolen bike - for 2 thousand zlotys.
Last Tuesday, one of the district districts of Zamość noticed at Wyszyńskiego audi Street, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
There was a 50-year-old behind the wheel.
The man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard allegations of fuel theft from four gas stations and a bicycle.
He admitted to committing these crimes.
Mundur also found a stolen bike.
The unity will soon return to the owner.
For stealing a thief, the sentence of imprisonment is threatened by 5 years.
Trump Nominates Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he testifies at a Senate Budget Subcommittee on National Security on the FEMA Budgetary Draft for the financial year 2020 at the Capitol Hill in Washington, USA on April 3, 2019.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House reported Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the deputy administrator of FEMA, is the head of an agency that oversees a government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has been operating without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March, when Brock Long fired this position.
Long resigned after the U.S. Department of National Security, to which the FEMA is subject, stated that Long misused government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough examination of his past revealed the allegations that he was involved in the bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination was expected for this position.
To approve his nomination for this role, the majority in the Senate will be required.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became FEMA’s deputy administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Herik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, is considering finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized at a distance of 1500 meters, winning a gold medal of the European Championship in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the European Deputy Champion at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new ailment and that he had already undergone one operation immediately after the 2016 Games, but the pains returned and in the current season got very intense.
Pain makes me put my foot differently, which in turn changes the system of my body, other unnatural loads occur, and I begin to feel pain in other places, for example, in the middle of the sea.
For this reason, I couldn’t prepare enough for the world championship, and for two weeks the pain has been so severe that I have difficulty setting up earrings,” said the runner on the NRK TV channel’s antenna.
Gjert Ingebrigtsen’s father and coach admitted that after long discussions with their son, they concluded that the only solution not to end his career and participate in the next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only, though drastic solution and the decision has actually been made.
“If part of the body hurts, it is necessary to get rid of it, and in total, Henri does not need this finger so much, and in this situation it is necessary to forget about the cosmetic aspect,” he explained.
Police shut down illegal e-cigarette factory in San Gabriel - CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) - On Thursday the police closed an illegal e-cigarette factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
At 9600 Telstar Avenue, about 16:37 a raid was made, during which the police searched for illegal e-cigarettes containing marijuana, and during which large jars containing butane hash oil were found - a concentrate of cannabis.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, officers also found a device that was used to replenish vaping inputs.
“This process is very dangerous,” Cano says.
Cano, who once worked on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
“The usual electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the ignition of these fumes, causing not only a fire, but because of concentration, even an explosion,” he says.
“If there are many jars in the room and the like, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could throw the whole complex out of the surface.
A team called on the office to do special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant, so they detected illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to get information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up an interest in this place, because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to be sure that illegal products have not hit the street, considering recent articles on the harmfulness of vaping.
“People don’t really know what products they buy,” Cano says.
“They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This can pose a threat to our community and children, so we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin is withdrawn from the market.
Gif made a decision on a mold medicine
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate announced that the medicine was withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat fungi and yeast infections of the oral membrane, infections with Gram-positive bacteria.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to non-compliance with the quality specification of the product and the decrease in the content of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenna Laboratory in Olsztyn.
Every month, GIFs make a number of decisions on the withdrawal of a series of products from the market.
The series of drugs suspended in Poland can, after presenting evidence for the safety of its use, be re-introduced.
If the medicine is withdrawn, there is no such possibility.
Banknote 19 PLN - where to buy a collector's note about this nominal?
He was nominated for 19 zlotys and shows the image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collector’s note will be introduced, the National Bank of Poland said.
This is another note from the series \"Independence\"
It commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Polish Securities Factory.
As stated in the NBP’s communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknotes.
The date placed on the banknotes, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW was established.
Also, the nominal value, PLN 19, refers to the year of creation of the Factory,” the NBP said in a statement.
The watermark depicts the image of the eagle from the first Polish note produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
The new feature is a holographic strip located on the window in the substrate.
The front page presents a portrait of Ignatius Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription \"independent - a stylized image of the Order of the White Eagle was presented.
This inscription, drawn from the manuscript of Józef Pilsudski, is a logo of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Poland’s recovery of independence.
In the branch of the laureate, symbolising fraternity and victory, the protection developed by the PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angular effect, was incorporated.
On the opposite side of the note was the image of the building of the Factory against the background of the panorama of modern Warsaw.
In addition to the built-in PWPW logo, the SPARK Live security and the sun strip are also visible in UV light in the form of repeated numbers -19 - and abbreviation -NBP -, the NBP says.
Banknote is expected to enter the circulation on October 2, up to 55,000 units.
One note will cost 80 zlotys.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from special series, are a legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value far exceeds that which can be achieved on the collector's market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, more than $2 million, for his parents, and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton, where it was loaded on the shoulder.
From there, he crossed the river 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
The President of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska in the upcoming elections.
“Please do the same,” he said.
Jarosław Kaczyński together with Małgorzata Gosiewski were sued for a photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw’s “troika” boasted on social media that it will win Kaczyński’s vote in parliamentary elections.
“Preses of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewski,” she said on Facebook.
The party’s chief said he was a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to help.
“I will give my voice to Małgorzata Gosiewska and ask for the same thing,” he appeals.
Gossiewska is running for the Sejm from District 19 (Warsaw) and from third place on the list.
“The only one is Kaczyński himself, and Mariusz Kamiński takes second place.
The Christmas Book Fair is coming.
In front of us, meetings with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
“We are here to break stereotypes.
The inhabitants of Podkarpać are told that they do not read books.
We’ll show that it’s different,” she said at a press conference called Marta Semitorak.
And who will support the reading in Rzeszów this year?
As we have heard, at the fair will appear the sister Anastasia, shouted by the first chef of the Republic of Poland, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrovska and Jakub Świek.
This autumn, the Millennium Hall will host a great cultural event - on 22 and 23 November, the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Fair, one of the most important reading events in the region, will come to the shopping centre.
The most interesting publishing and bookmaking offices from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be 30 of them, including Agora, Sign, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they will present their wide publishing offers and hundreds of book news, which the participants of the fair will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, there will be unique meetings with writers during the two days of the fair.
This time, authors have been invited to write about important things and are not afraid to take difficult topics, and they are also winners of prestigious awards and... they cook well.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, they confirmed their participation in the fair, among others Łukasz Orbitowski, the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wisniewski, i.e. the author of the best-selling “Semotnost on the network”, and the queen of the Polish crime: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year’s fair will be Sister Anastasia, author of several books (including cookbooks) which sold more than 4 million copies.
An exhibition of Elizabeth I's missing dress at Hampton Court Palace
intertwined with a silver thread, the dress made of the most outstanding silk campet was kunsztowly decorated with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterfly.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces exhibition, it meant only one thing.
The faded fabric hanging for 100 years on the wall of the tiny rural parish church, which she looked at, could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I’s wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn encountered an exhibition altar fabric in Bacton, Herefordshire County, Elizabeth’s missing dress is about to hit an exhibition next month at Hampton Court, close to the same premises where the Queen of the Tudor dynasty could have worn it more than 450 years ago.
The measure of the importance of this discovery is that from the whole collection of royal dresses, only one more element of the 16th century dress survived.
Although there is no unbeatable evidence that Elizabeth would ever wear this dress, three years of research has strengthened experts in the belief that she must have been part of a royal wardrobe.
\"Serbrogls - an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of embroidery plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the dress belonged to the most excellent of the people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, could cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
“Moreover, in the 90s of the 16th century, at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, she felt a threat from other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such fabric,” Lynn said.
“As a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to look at the dress.
I was really pleased to see the dress, and they also enjoyed it, and they were practically convinced that we had an element of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
The long, re-life of the dress, cut to serve as an altar fabric in the dark St Faith Church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the closest lady of Elizabeth, served the Queen for her long life and with whom the fabric was identified in local legends.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parra family or parish to the memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, four hundred of which went on the most delicate hand sewing using specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will go to the exhibition next to the exhibition rented for the time by Hatfield House Portrait Palace \"Rainbow Portrait - one of the most famous paintings of the time depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
“When working with historical fabrics, it really starts to respect the skills of the people who made them,” says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, whose majority took place in a greenhouse converted to this end at Hampton Court, the only large enough place to accommodate some of the invaluable palace gospels.
“Looking at the embroidery at the front and at the back, I started to feel a lot of respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The Lost Dress of Elizabeth will begin on October 12 at Hampton Court.
Fitch has confirmed Poland’s rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed Poland’s long-term rating in foreign currency at “A-” level on Friday.
The outlook of the rating remained stable.
“The Fitch Agency points to a strong macroeconomic foundation and a well-diversified economy that is supported by a reasonably conducted economic policy and a strong banking sector,” the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the business cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Brutto National Product in Poland would be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.
The Agency forecasts that the government deficit to GDP for 2020-2021 will remain below the 3% threshold, 2.3% and 1.9% respectively.
“The government and local government debt indicator for GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent, and in the coming years it will be smaller (on average 48.3 percent in the period 2020-2021),” he said.
Rating of Poland
The autumn review round of Poland’s rating will end S&P and Moody’s on 11 October.
The rating of Poland in Fitch’s assessment remains the same as it was released at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed the rating of Poland at “A-” level with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies in Poland, Moody’s ratings credit credibility at level “A2”
The rating of Poland according to Fitch and S&P is “A- one level lower than Moody’s.
The perspectives of all assessments are stable.
What is a rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to help investors assess the risk scale of their investment activities.
The rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing more than creditworthiness assessment.
On the basis of it, decisions are made about who and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests to whom it is best not to give any loans at all, because there is a high risk that money will not be able to recover.
A lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is a high interest on the loan.
Each assessment must be justified and reasoned.
Ratings can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the global credit rating market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
Confederate Friday: First 1000 Plus
The Confederate Friday - the main assumptions of the electoral programme - were presented on Friday by candidates for the Sejm from the district of 40 applying for a mandate from the list of KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Koszalin letter to the Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the slogan \"Fifths of the Confederation -
“First, the 1000 plus programme for Poland, secondly, fast and fair courts, thirdly cultural bon and educational bon, fourthly national security, fifthly this is a healthy life,” Chmielewski said.
He said: “Police must finally start earning money, and that’s why the Confederacy wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, “the tax-free problem will solve itself.”
“Polaks need to be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all,” said the leader of the letter on the assumptions of the 1000 plus for Poland program.
On the other hand, Alexander Zadecka, who started from the second place of the list, referring to the programmable slogan “healthy life”, said that “food is getting worse and worse, and in order to change this, it is necessary to “support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture” to work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederacy also advocates the cessation of the “gray cannabis stigmatization”
Zadecka declared the Confederacy’s support for the “development of natural raw materials-using construction”
She also spoke on behalf of her group for “voluntary vaccinations.”
“The right to conscious consent cannot be violated,” she added.
Other candidates to the Sejm from the Koszalin district stressed that the Confederation was behind “conducting a deep reform of the judiciary,” which would include, among other things, the case being dealt with by a judge “day after day”.
They also said that the educational subsidy would go to schools without the help of local governments, that is, without additional costs associated with the maintenance of officials.
The Confederacy is also behind the “strong Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers”
Candidates to the Sejm stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
They also need easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for \"continuous access to energy\"
“We can gasify coal, we have large deposits of geothermal energy, we need to consider going back to the idea of a nuclear power plant,” said Piotr Karpiński.
Mexican cartel chief stands for one-third of U.S. drugs
Chicago, just after sunrise on West Side at Chicago CBS News, reported a morning pursuit of drugs.
Brian McKnight from the Drug Fighting Authority (DEA) in full light showed what was going on.
Last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdoses in Chicago.
McKnight said, “Probably 90%, drugs in Chicago come from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesie, known simply as El Mencho.
“It is the most important priority for the SEA and directly for the federal executive bodies in the United States,” said Matthew Donahue, the main agent of the DEA in Mexico.
The award for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs located in the jungle.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) is responsible for at least one-third of the drugs reaching the U.S. by land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel smuggled \"tones - cocaine, methamphetamines and heroin polluted with Fentanyl.
El Mencho has a $10 million prize for his head.
Ironically, about 30 years ago he lived in California, where he was arrested for drug-related charges and was eventually deported to Mexico.
It was there that he created a brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPGs, weapons of a 50-calibre.
In principle, he owns his own SWAT teams,” Donahue added.
El Mencho unpunishedly protects his empire by using means such as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or taking part in a public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be handled without protective equipment.
In the laboratory, cocaine packets are referred to as the smuggler's brand.
For more than a third of them, the traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
“It is he who is responsible for sending a poison that kills innocent women and children,” Donahue said.
So when a child dies, Donahue believes there is a “big chance” that drugs come from El Mencho.
More than 67,000 Americans died last year.
France: 27-year-old extorted French president and wife
“The 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady,” the French prosecutor said.
The defendant ensures that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He asked the head of state, among other things, 300,000 euros in cash.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in the police in France claims to have received “explosive” documents from a person employed in the Elysian Palace.
At the time of the hearing, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but the disclosure of them in its entirety can even threaten Macron's security and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded 300,000 euros - he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of the daughters of Brigitte Macron from his previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the accused refused to provide the police with the documents he was talking about.
He said he would pass it on to the media - but for now it is not known if these documents really exist.
They were not found during the revision in the apartment of this 27-year-old.
The man was subjected to psychiatric examinations, but doctors did not notice any serious disorders in him.
PS4 game will be old-school - Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the debuting game that will soon be available exclusively on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony announced in a recent State of Play presentation that the release of The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new fragment of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.
Even more specifics were revealed in the days after the loud premiere of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for old-school climates in many ways.
It was decided to do something we haven’t seen much since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a great interview with The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown to one of the most extensive games in history.
“The plot is ambitious and confounded in aspects where the one was not,” he said.
It had to be so extensive to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We did not intend to create the most comprehensive game, so it just happened.
“We’re excited to know how many opportunities are in this story. There will be moments when you think you’re heading to the end, but you’re going to realize that this is just the beginning and that a whole new chapter is starting,” Druckmann said.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRayu and it's on two tiles.
The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two adult egg posters.
We will not miss surprises, but emerging in the game of the Easter Eggs appeal to the old-school works of Naughty Dog.
You will find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two will debut on February 21, 2020 exclusively on PS4.
PS4 users can prepare for the release of the sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available on PS Plus.
Sony has recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the above-mentioned production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to MLB The Show 19 since October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to place a pre-premier order for a sequel, Sony said there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of the Elli backpack and its bracelets and a 30-centimetre figure of this iconic character.
Run, Scrap and Fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil takes Podbeskid and wants to win.
The players of Stomil from three lines are unbeatable.
At that time, the caregivers of Piotr Zazączkowski scored seven points because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match there was a gateless draw in the slides.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites to advance to Extraclass.
The nearest rivals of Stomila take fourth place in the table and have a point of advantage over the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskidy played six times this season and counted for two victories, draw and failures, while Stomil feels very good at his facility - at the stadium at Al. Piłsudskiego 69, the team of Piotr Zazączkowski won three times and lost once.
In total, in ten lines, the Olstynians collected 17 points and are at the top of the table, although after two failures at the start of the game, nothing announced it.
“Every change takes time to get results,” explains Piotr Skiba.
“And finally, we’ve had a bit of a bit of a bit of it, we’ve believed in each other, but we can work in normal conditions.
We were just focusing on playing the ball.
There are clear heads, there is a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff.
On Tuesday, the Stomil players eliminated the Chorzów Movement from the Polish Cup, but they needed a series of penalty shots and games.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go south of Poland, because coach Zazączkowski gave these key players a rest before the Saturday battle with Podbeskid.
In Chorzów, Jakub Mosakowski, who eventually shot his long-awaited goal, played back after the injury.
“It’s always nice to get a goal, and I’m still in such a moment that we can continue to play in the Cups (Mosakowski leveled at 3:3 in 119 minutes - red).
My dad often bit me and laughed that I couldn't get the goal, and I always told him I'd shoot at the moment he wasn't expecting it.
Now Mosakowski is counting on returning to the basic composition, the more because of the yellow cards he cannot play Ołéh Tarasenko.
“This is why I’m very careful about training to be able to play in the first lineup,” says Mosakowski.
“In Chorzów I did everything I could to present myself as best I could.
However, whether I play or sit on the reserve bench, I will still support the team.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskid.
We are sure to have a difficult meeting in which victory will have to run out, gnaw and fight.
In the middle of the Olympic defense, Rafał Remisz can still play, who has recently also had an injury, so whether to perform it, we will find out only on Saturday, more so that the coach Zawaczkowski traditionally tries to keep the matter secret until the end.
A man raped and murdered a sister
“You will never see daylight.
“You will never breathe fresh air again,” said Judge Kevin K. Allen, referring to Alex Whipple.
“What you did was so repulsive and despicable that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison,” he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple pointed out the place of hiding the body.
“How could anyone do this to his own nephew,” Desay Smith, uncle of the girl, asked.
“You are the worst person humanity has to offer,” he said to Alex Whipple.
“I would give anything to meet her again, hug her,” said the mother of the murdered girl.
“Our lives will never be the same again,” added the angry woman.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple did not show any emotions during the hearing.
Last month, he admitted he had kidnapped, sexually abused, and murdered a girl.
A man’s lawyer said his client was raised in an “unperfect family”
He was to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to suffer punishment.
A man was sentenced to life without the possibility of applying for a conditional exemption.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will donate nearly $100 million to drought-affected communities.
The program providing money to the dried farmers will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of additives on the farm will be simplified.
The aid package covers nearly $34 million for a drought-affected community support initiative, allowing eligible farms to receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local local local local areas under the drought-affected assistance programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure grants and assistance in dealing with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to more than $7 billion for the government to the drought fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
Documentary: In China, the number of divorces has doubled in the last decade.
The cause of this condition was generally third parties.
More and more men maintain extramarital relations, which has led to the education of a particular industry in this country - a professional crowd of lovers who are tasked with saving marriages of betrayed wives.
Let's go out loud: Ma-te-ear!
Attempt to welcome Prime Minister in Silesian Ovens
A separate general trial was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in the Silesian Ovens.
\"Dear State, louder, louder, in this way we will not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's go out loud: Ma-te-ear, he encouraged the lead.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic leader did not yield the expected result.
Election campaign in progress.
Politicians drive across the country, persuading voters.
The intensive campaign is also led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who as the leader of the Silesian PiS list is a frequent guest in this region.
Each meeting is carefully planned, including the appropriate fixture.
It was, or rather, supposed to be, in the Silesian Ovens.
We know that a special guest should be welcomed.
Before meeting with the Prime Minister, he decided to run a general test in the room.
He tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
“It will not be a welcome to me, but to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Even louder, louder, my dear ones, he encouraged the enthusiast.
Unfortunately, the crowd could not be fully kidnapped by the warm motivators and reluctantly responded “Ma-te-lear,” but the recording of the enthusiastic leader makes a fury on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of killing Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay House on 9 July 2014, demanding the disclosure of his wife's place of residence, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, according to the Department of County of Harris.
Only one member of the family survived, the 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was severely injured, but she was completely healed.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell’s defense on the basis of innumerability.
The jury will meet again on Monday to give judgment.
The quantum internet is getting closer to reality - ScienceDaily
The results of U.S. military research are moving the quantum internet a step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and accuracy of time maintenance inaccessible with a traditional approach to networking.
The Center for Distributed Quantum Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the U.S. Army Fighting Opportunities looked at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state of matter and light at a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber cables.
Convincing is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as kubits.
When two kubits are confused and one of them is measured, it will have an impact on the measurement made on the other, even if the other kubit is physically distant.
“These [50 km] are two orders of size beyond what was possible before, and this is a feasible distance to begin building intercity quantum networks,” said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and a major researcher in the project, whose discoveries were published in the journal Nature, the Quantum Information section.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of physical kubit networks, which are intertwined with each other despite a large physical distance.
Researchers have found that this dispersion of the confused state is necessary for the creation of a quantum internet.
“This demonstration is a big step forward in order to achieve a large-scale distributed state,” said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-organising a military program supporting these studies.
The quality of the condition confused at the other end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team began the experiment with calcium atom trapped in the ion trap.
Using laser beams, the researchers entered the quantum state into ion, at the same time encouraging it to emit a photon in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were confused.
The challenge is to send a photon with a fiber cable.
“The photon emitted by calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the fiber,” Lanyon said.
Therefore, his team initially sent a particle of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser ray.
The length of the photon wave has been converted into an optimal value from the point of view of transmission to long distances - the current standard telecommunication wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-kilometre fiber cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and the particles of light were still tangled even after the wavelength was transformed and the distance passed.
“The decision to choose calcium means that this result sets a direct path for the creation of a congested network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, because calcium can be intertwined with a high-quality kubita “zegara”
The army is very interested in large-scale congested clock networks due to their applications for precise positioning, precise navigation, and time synchronization,” said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also manages the program.
