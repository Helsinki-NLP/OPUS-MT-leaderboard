Barack Obama to Receive US President of the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo for 26 hours to win the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be given, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning and with Michelle's wife and will be busy.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time five members of the committee who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will win it as the fourth president of the United States, but only the third one to win the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when receiving the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he realizes that the prize takes over as president, who is currently fighting in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago increased by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of its critics.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a particular charity.
The charged program will then take the president to the banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will also be present.
From the beginning, Obama was rather intrusive.
For example, he said he felt he didn’t deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all those who seek the same value as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said that he was “a challenge to action.”
Protector of nature accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice Police charged the chairman of the civil association with extortion by the Society of Nature Protectors Litoměřice.
In several cases, in the last year he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawing the appeal he demanded money from investors for his benefit, Litoměřice police spokesman Alena Romová said.
The chairman of the Litoměřic Society of Protectors of Nature is Lubomír Studnicki.
Now he's in custody and he's in prison for up to three years.
Brnu cutting containers do not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
You can take a few minutes to find the right ash cans.
I don't want to say that the waste didn't go to Brno at all.
But it seems to me that we are the second-largest city in the republic, and the councillors are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only by throwing only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers as citizens, but above all by the number of garbages for such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to shoot a PET bottle in a collection basket?
It's a ready-made piece, especially it takes time and tight nerves.
The only place I've ever been to is in the Moravian Square opposite Potredoné Hus.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think it's gonna matter to me.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
Many of my friends don’t prefer to cut waste.
From laziness.
They have it far to the ashes.
I'm not surprised at them.
After the celebration, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored ash in the sight of Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on my way to the salad.
The waste was overflowing.
It's still the center of Brno, which the city represents the most, isn't it?
However, ecology and some aesthetics probably do not care much about Brno socialists.
The city would rather buy a hockey extraliga that will make us ashamed throughout the Republic than buy some extra containers and offer to sort out more raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I could confirm my opinion after a while on the internet with official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubk's budget took money for pensions and sick people
Once the left has added money to farmers or officials despite the government’s opinion, there may not be any pension, sickness or building savings in the budget.
But also interest on state debt or international court disputes.
This will bring problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When Social Democrats and Communists promoted increases to some groups, they relyed on sensitive spending, pensions, or sickness to lend themselves to the government.
In fact, the money borrowed is paying more and more interest, and sometimes it has to come back.
A lot of choice where to take it, the state has no choice.
If it does not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, it must raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People don’t have to worry about retirements or sick people who have lost 1.8 billion of their accounts, they get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted - the next year will not miss only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow more and more quickly, along with the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce motherly income, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the money shifts in favour of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mainly already competitive and disassembled sections, which can not be redesigned and can not be discounted.
At the most conservative, which is also not free.
It means that 30 large buildings are delayed or stopped, the use of European money is also at risk, says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD has suggested that the loss of money will be solved in Solomonian terms - it reaches the dividends of CZECH, which the state of most of its own, and from them the transport fund will add.
The problem is that the dividend is never sure, and it’s no longer a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion came from CZECH to the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay for the disposal of ecological damage, complements the pension account or serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
However, this does not end the Carnival of Transfers.
Nearly three billion have been lost in the budget for various compensations to victims of Communism and crime or to spending on court disputes, even on building savings.
If you don’t get around without that money, you’re not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay it the same way, says Janot.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing from the already launched two-billion-dollar State Treasury project, which is intended to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities spend on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, says Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone, on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
Revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and move from Windows Mobile to Android within seconds.
This is precisely what the U.S. company VMware aims to focus mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile at once.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same time, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was modified by the Nokia N800 with a 128MB RAM, which was also run alongside the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualization and customers should reach their devices during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains bothers the hoteliers
The bare pistes do not worry only to the Giants.
The missing snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a great visit to our website.
People are going through deals, finding out prices, but so far they are afraid to order.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask if this year’s Christmas is going to be snow or mud,” said Martin Jandura, information portal operator at Spindl.Info.
Anyone who wants a New Year's Eve stay in Špindlerův Mlyn exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is in second place can still try a few days to wait.
Spindler hotels so far offer on New Year's Eve mostly only weekly stays.
I think they'll try to give them a little more, but then they'll allow and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will quickly drop,” said Jandura.
Free beds in all winter periods are still offered by the Vrchlab travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats on our offer remain free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,” said Ingtoursu Director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still be offered by the Vrchlab travel agency, but there are fewer available places.
The first 14 days in February are also well-off, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is better than last year to occupy the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better at this.
We have the last few places for Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
A lot of interest is in Polish holidays in January and is being sold well in February,” said the director of the best hotel Karel Rada.
The Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janske Lázne is also occupied by New Year's Eve stays.
On the other hand, at Christmas, half of the beds are still available at the latest hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we already have about 60 percent occupied at the moment.
February is a little weaker, but as soon as the snow attacks, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly continue to rise, Hotel Omnia’s director Erik Sporysch said.
However, on the larger part of the snow, the Giant Hotels have yet to taste.
It is expected to cool down on Thursday if there are any precipitation, so there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
U.S.: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical, with what school effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the wisest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally supplanted his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had described it through a copier from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does he use vocabulary several times in the text itself - as in Iraq - but he did not hesitate to use the name of Bush's statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: \"The new way forward\"
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by civil war as “irresponsible and in the wake of a catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of field commanders was the only possible and most successful so that he was not talking about Iraq today.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
He was once again asked to raise his military counter-opinion by field commanders, especially Afghan Operation Commander General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his sub-ordination practice, harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he did not fall for anything better, so at least he deceived the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to promise another 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half the increase will give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the deal.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are observed.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are preparing to change the master every day according to how they fit.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a gloomy village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to rise.
The balancing of the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely complex due to the inexplicability of the conditions that make Pakistani and Iranian influences even more difficult.
Not even building a \"accessible state\" - which is the minimalistic goal of the entire operation, does it seem too real.
Obama’s strategy is going to stop his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of the explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to war in order to “brute return home” will cause a miracle here, can only the soul truly romantic, without being touched by reality.
From a political point of view, the date of withdrawal of troops is a clear irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is a minus.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Indian subterranean.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions on the Iranians do not impress, there will be an excessive question before the United States whether to try not to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to a winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain in the presidential election, so there is plenty of time left to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total downturn.
Bank managers of Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash rewards
Goldman Sachs’ senior executives will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that reacts to a sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive shares instead of money that can be sold first in five years.
In addition, actions can be taken away from managers if they risk excessively.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to go, said former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been criticised for almost $17 billion in the first three quarters of this year (almost $300 billion) in rewards.
According to Reuters, the total amount of rewards in the company for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High remunerations in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries with the coming of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to charge £25,000 to bankers (approximately CZK 712.000) at a one-time charge of 50%.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
Today, the record five women in Stockholm received the Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature from Sweden’s King Carl XVI.
In addition to four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was won by Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
Israel's Ada Jonas, along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the Prize for Chemistry for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that passed without a holder this year was physics.
Today, Charles Kao and Willard Boyl were awarded this award for their optical fiber research for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each prize winner received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of financial reward.
For each category, it amounts to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million CZK).
If they are awarded more in each of them, they share the reward with each other.
The most traditionally anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was won by U.S. President Barack Obama in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of his appreciation, for it is only at the beginning of his course and, moreover, he is at the forefront of a country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policies, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to combat peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering demisi. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will accept the Minister of Finance Eduard Janot, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for the following year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget, and perhaps even Janot's insistence in the cabinet, will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticizing Klaus.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to talk to Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which will now receive Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed to the proposals of the left to move money and to raise money on the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has made proposals for social democracy by secretly increasing budget deficits.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, there was a sharp intra-political dispute, for which a question mark began to arise over the further operation of Fischer’s office cabinet, on which the formation of which was agreed in spring by the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed by Fischer’s government in autumn and is to stop the state’s debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the State Budget Act, said today's breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the \"serious problem\" of \"unsustainable deficit\" of public finances.
Today, he no longer has a good solution.
Improving could only bring a strong government that could, moreover, rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president says.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget was scary and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President Petr Nečas said ČTK that the concept of office cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and greens is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as “strong statements”
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek saying that the deficit of the budget, prepared by the former Topolánkov government for this year, is horrific and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD designated the approval of the state budget as a success for next year.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandela played Morgan Freeman in Clinton Eastwood
South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some critics that American actors play the lead roles.
The story tells about sports, racial conditions, and Nelson Mandela.
An tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela asked him if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have access to you.
A twenty-seven-year-old actor who won the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the Million Dollar Baby boxing environment has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the slavery abolition movement, from which he eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, and even a god in the Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was 27 years in prison for his active work on ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated, and it is the name of the poem of English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players, who belong on a global scale to outsiders.
The South African team will eventually join the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on the screen.
“I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could bring it as close as possible to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world’s politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I push your hand, I'm taking over your energy, it's moving, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon starred in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team where white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember how I rang the doorbell, he opened to me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in actors’ characters compared to their actual performances under the direction of the director Eastwood, Invictus won: Undefeated positive reviews and was also discussed about the ambitions at the Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment into the words: “It was a very good story, a very well-made film.”
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76% of positive reviews.
The Secrets of the Shine Over Norway Dissolved: The Russians Tested the Missile
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry admitted yesterday that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch was once again unsuccessful, and a shot called the \"Bulava\" type, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the proper effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava usually did not fly or damage in the air.
In the Russian newspaper, he wrote about “Bulava” as a rocket that does not fly.
A rocket that does not fly but shine
The 13th attempt was done normally at first.
At the end of the flight, the machine was damaged again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, Bulava started from the Dmitry Donski nuclear submarine, which sailed below the White Sea.
This type of rocket enables the launch of a vessel that is on the move and also submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a narrower flying object was really misplaced -Bulava -
The Norwegians had no doubt at first that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals defend themselves and claim that there is no clear talk about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted, and the accident hit only three.
In previous cases, the engines broke out in the first stage.
Even though there was no test launch without a mistake, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defense.
Therefore, almost 50% of the success of the generals is filled with optimism, and so it still claims that “Bulava” will fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signs annual contract in CSKA Moscow at 51 years
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will be again in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his CSKA Moscow team in an emergency and will appear in the KHL Friday duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at age 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš has been injured, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to solve some formalities, the AP coaching agency of the Moscow club Sergei Germanov quoted.
It is not clear if the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, said German.
According to the AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in the event of a return to the ice.
In the NHL he played for the entire season at the end of the year for Hartford, a legendary striker, Gordie Howe, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world champion titles, and won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in his shirt.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai is in compliance with the trade unions.
Hyundai’s leadership has agreed to cancel all the time.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtimes that the unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai’s spokesman Petr Vaneek.
However, leadership wants to agree with trade unions on another Saturday shift this year.
We can’t opt out of our production plan, it’s essential, so it was designed to volunteer overtime on Saturday, 19 December, with two shifts being made, Vanek said.
Server Sediczka.cz wrote that the company of employees who work on Saturday shifts offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get back to work on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanka, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they will be able to pay an overtime fee or they can choose a spare holiday on December 28th, thus extending their Christmas holidays by a day, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid fares and lunch.
Since the overtimes were the most urgent and pressing point in terms of the comments and complaints of trade union workers, as well as the protesters of workers, which last week had temporarily stopped production, last afternoon the management decided with immediate effect to cancel all the overtimes for the month of December, Vanek said.
The company’s employees were forced to work two more hours each day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will withdraw the strike alert
Further negotiations between the management of the automaker and trade unionists will take place on Friday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchar said Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the automaker has escalated last week, when about 400 employees spontaneously striked due to constant overtimes.
They also protested against bad pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management objected that overtime workers had to do so to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
In their Monday announcement, trade unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who discontinued production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions require the company to reduce timeless work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a prize of CZK 5000 this year.
Hyundai is now employing 2,000 people.
Serial production started last November.
By September, it produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also deals with \"poor\" HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also deals with viruses that have already acquired immunity against drugs.
This fact, in some cases, outweighs the fact that the compound does not affect the normal variant of the virus as strongly as some of the medicines already available.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Moreover, incomplete suppression of the virus’s proliferation results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalcarborane act on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalcarbonates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new “improved” compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalcarbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Traitable and Resistant Virus
HIV Protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV-induced protease, adult infectious virus particles would not be created.
When we stop HIV synthesis, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is further systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV proteinase has been tested in the test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants derived from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalcarborans on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical treatments make metalocarbonates interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective anti- HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezačová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
A fight over the budget.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek has identified the approved budget for the next year as \"serious\" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
ODS called the Prime Minister strong statements.
He's keeping his time for analysis.
Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the office cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
The president of the government must decide whether he intends to base himself on a minority in the House, which is to fight against a rising deficit, or whether he is to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, said Nečas.
On Wednesday, the House adopted a budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House raised money on the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s spending on the proposals for social democracy was that they secretly increased budget deficits.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote, ODS left the hall, meeting the government’s wishes that even the budget changed is a less bad option than the budget commission.
Disappointment and prodigy
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke about the disappointment and feeling of vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still assess the situation.
It is not time to believe that if Janota seriously threatened to leave office in the event of adoption of amendments, the situation might look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering staying in office.
The reason is his disappointment about the budget.
If Fischer is spoken out for a further fight against budget deficits, they have nothing in the government to do with the ČSSD nominees who have made changes to the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves additional laws of the increasing deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions or the amendment of the Staff Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not guilty
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people who voted against the budget on TOP 09.
It is not time to stress that if Fischer decides to give up the principle of combating the height of the government deficit, it is absolutely logical and correct that he will base himself on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the House of Commons.
He said he could not count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and when it’s up to date, I’m going to do it,” Defense Minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, who was nominated by civil Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS resigned.
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would apparently vote against the revised budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister of the Democratics had not specifically requested that the adoption of the budget be allowed.
We do not look like orphans, we are not young children, and then he answered the question whether the ODS did not burden the absence of the party president in the Parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikization of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD regulations, fewer trains are going for almost the same fare.
As of December 13, the Czech Railway will cancel or limit some of the less busy speeds and locales, while other connections will be strengthened.
From the date of validity of the new timetable, the total traffic range will be reduced by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will gain more connectivity to the capital, and the tracks will add one set of pendolino.
The train stops going to Bratislava.
Less speeds will also take place on the route Prague - Písek - České Budapest, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be significantly limited.
The regions are planning the largest transport reduction in the Kralovehradice Region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Ceske Budejovice and the operation of several speeds on the route Prague - Písek - Ceske Budejovice is limited to only a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice has to go to Lysé nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovice.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jeseník will go at two-hour intervals.
Pendolin to Bratislava will no longer be taken by passengers from 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
Rapids are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, total to pay so-called demonstrable losses will give the expensive next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. Locals are ordering countries, totaling eight billion crowns for them next year, with less than three billion countries contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are more than 200 million more expensive.
There is a new ten-year contract for the locals and the speeds, so far the contract has always been for one year.
Railways praise the system, and therefore do not seem to have reached the price rise of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur on the day-to-day network tickets of ČD Net and cheap online tickets of eLiška.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will be newly derived from the distance taken, until now it was uniform for the journey between any regional city and it was 160 crowns.
Philippine militants still hold more than 50 people, children released
In the south of the Philippines, armed men kidnapped 75 people, including a few primary school students and their teachers.
It was reported by AFP, which originally only reported 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 soldiers are said to be using hostages as a living shield while fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police initially persecuted the hijacker because of the violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, civil law was declared because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections to the governor’s office.
The governor of this South Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested for suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But on Tuesday they restored peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clinton Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter was performed by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose for his performance years ago.
The next male role of the legendary South African champion in rugby Francois Pienaar was performed by Matt Damon.
With the launch of the film, critics and the public come out of the comments.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in the South African Mvez.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, along with the de Klerek Nobel Peace Prize.
The President of South Africa was from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when, in South Africa, the preparations for the World Cup in football are, at the same time, shocking news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in JAR are positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main roles of the Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming about that role for years and prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to draw his energy, he said in an interview after the premiere of the Los Angeles film.
I think it's good if we can remind the movie of Mandela's personality and message.
It's the story of South Africa, but it's about every human being, he added.
The National Rugby Team
The film, based on the British writer John Carlin's novel The role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation is a portrait of a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, therefore, tries to stifle two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the acting role in the South African National Rugby Shirt at the World Cup, which at that time JAR won.
For entering the lawn in the shirt, which is almost understood in JAR as something sacred, Mandela collected fourteen years ago a large sheep mainly from the white audience and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black player in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in JAR will improve will only show up.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as the example in a recent interview for LN revealed by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
In Loun, the transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the fire caught Čeps’ transformer at the Vyškov village in Lounsko.
According to a spokesperson for Russian regional firefighters, Lukáš Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially, firefighters wanted to burn the transformer out, but later the opinion was re-evaluated and the fire extinguished a mixture of water, foam and special fire extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, the internal abbreviation of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Paula Mandátová, the crash does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it can be accurately calculated only after the fire has ended.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years, nothing like this has happened, the defects of this type are unique, she added.
The supply of electricity, according to a spokesperson for the Czech Republic, was not disrupted by Soni Holinger’s Hendrychová, the operation of households, offices and companies did not affect the fire of the tramostation.
A.s. Čeps acts in the Czech Republic as an exclusive operator of the transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distributions with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and a line of 4339 kilometers in length.
Jančura to file a criminal notice for defamation for three Czech-SSD captains
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will now file a criminal notice for defamation to three socio-democratic captains.
On Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubice Region and the head of Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said it in 20 minutes of Radio Journal.
The action is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional train transport in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about choosing race, while we only offered what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we're not left to defend ourselves.
It's for apologizing to the Student Agency, said Jančura Radio.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares the initiative for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the submission of a criminal notification to be a further continuation of the media show of Mr. Jančura, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend the good name of my country and my country, and I will call on the other captains to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr. Jančura who manipulates the public on regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will highlight the disadvantages of the region.
The radio station said the campaign would stop after Christmas and continue after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign started with Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and to order around 150 billion crowns did not write a tender.
According to Jančura, similar acts are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur said he was also threatening a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't let that happen, we could lose the bus license.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know what the master is about, I will not say his name, said the Jančura Radio Journal today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccinations will break down the practice since January.
It should be the first free and optional for families.
However, there are already voices that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for free vaccination against pneumococcals peak.
The drug institute already sets the maximum rates for vaccines paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for children in August
Since January, children who were born on 2 August and later on can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier must pay for further vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, she volunteered to have her children vaccinated against pneumococcals for a quarter of families.
Parents paid $1,600 for one dose or more.
Four doses are needed when vaccinating the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccinations.
But it will save on treatment that children without vaccination would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 a year for all vaccine-related children.
The vaccine was introduced by the so-called Janot Pack.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain follicles and blood poisoning.
Up to 28 children under 10 years of age will die from pneumococcal infections in our hospital in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced covered area vaccination of children against pneumococcals in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it will be covered by insurance companies and optional.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, indicated by the head of the civil association Navoz Rudolf Kalovský.
Its pneumococcal vaccine association promotes long-term promotion.
Experts at the international conference that our association participated were not completely satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think that's the way we have to go now, said Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of pneumococcal vaccination.
At the moment, we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says doctors
The chairman of the Society of Professional Children's Doctors Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that she has voluntary vaccinations of her disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of vaccinations could be considered: “The situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary,” says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect their infants to have more than 80 percent of fresh parents vaccinated against pneumococcals from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is the first vaccine of children by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving money on further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves.
However, this is related to the concern of practical children's doctors regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them as much as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MEPs feared that insurance companies could “draw money out of health insurance”
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to estimates, individual children’s doctors will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, a significant amount.
It won’t be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The American artist's son 'steals at the museum'
Frank Frazetta's son, a renowned American fantasy creator, was accused of trying to steal $20 million of paintings (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used the Poconco Mountains excavator to break into the museum.
Mr. Frazetta, 81 years old, was famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time, the artist was located in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unsolicited police officer who said Mr. Frazetta's younger might have been motivated by long-lasting family disputes.
Before the police, Mr. Frazetta issued a younger sworn statement, aged 52, that he had done so on the instructions of his father, “to get into the museum in any possible way and move the images into the sweetening areas,” the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior denied any such permission, as the agency said.
Labour to prevent planned tax increases
The ministers advocated an increase in taxes and a reduction in expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory’s “promote” opportunity to show that he was serious about delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor also got under fire because of the disabilities of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, it is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Distinctiveness regarding social insurance
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of “problems.”
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is approximately £3 trillion a year - which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who have said it is a employment tax, while it should focus on restoring the economy.
This increase, limited to those incomes of more than £20000 per year, affects approximately 10 million workers.
PBR KEY BODY
Social Security Will Increase by Another 0.5% Since April 2011
The economic situation is getting worse than expected by 4.75% this year.
New taxation 50% of bankers bonuses
Increase in 1% of company taxes for depreciation in small businesses
Tax reduction for electric vehicles and wind power plants
Increased retirement by 2.5%
According to the state financial administration estimates, some revenue of £30,000 will be reduced by £90 per year, and some incomes of £40,000 will be reduced by £190, while some incomes of £10000 will increase by £110.
The ministers announced that their target of reducing the deficit by half by 2013 meant \"complicated decision-making\" but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be “a drop in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
“These are big numbers, which will allow us to cut the deficit by half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years,” the BBC said.
Mr. Timms said he believes that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In my opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the decrease of 3.5%, predicted in April - because loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
The Lost Opportunity
Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday warning against the “indebtedness crisis” of Labour, have identified the planned loan of £789 trillion over the next six years as intolerable.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as it could be paid for, they added, “cynically,” to postpone this decision until after the elections - which must take place until June 2010.
“They didn’t add anything significant that would be feasible,” said shadow finance minister Philip Hammer.
All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them -
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Laborists insist that schools, hospitals, and police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to the Torah proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support spending in the coming year, rather than to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are “built on the sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson reported on the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay the benefits in the next April - that this could lead to the accusation of the chancellor in the election campaign if the money was hard to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspicious Budget
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the beginning of the medium-term restrictions.
Acclaimed Institute of Budget Studies said Chancellor's figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in Budocnu including transport, higher education and defense.
“It’s really painful so far,” Robert Chote, director, said.
“All important statements will only come after the election if we win them,” said Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to Deloitte’s account revirusor.
This was a report on the suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it -
FBI investigates U.S. prisons in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating five Americans in Pakistani prisons suspected of connecting to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for attacking the house in Sargod in the province of East Punjabi, according to the BBC, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were declared missing in the last month at their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be from Pakistan, one of which has Egyptian ancestors, and others come from Yemen.
“If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there,” said Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the imprisonment and was in contact with families of missing students.
“We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are actually missing students,” she said.
Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them.
He said the house was always the center of interest of the local police and that there were no charges against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, Reuters reported, but said the United States must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover a terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.
The disappearance of these five students from home in Northern Virginia was reported by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of Amnesty for Iranians.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as in the past 20 years, according to Amnesty International’s report.
The report describes in detail the methods of torture in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this human rights report.
Officials described this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were held in custody, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five persons to the death penalty.
A BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Ayjatolah Alí Khomeini declared the injustice of certain forms of torture and banned their implementation in the correction facility of Karizak.
But since then, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as stated our correspondent.
The false confession.\"
Amnesty International quoted a report by a 26-year-old student in computing, Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook” and protests against election results.
“They hit me in the face,” he said in a statement.
I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me.
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubí was arrested after the elections and was tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied the rape charges, but admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also reported a case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with other 75 people for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had established committees to investigate the post-election riots and government response, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol monument into a downhill track for the race.
The downhill track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowbordisses to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the downhill track in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jumping bridge in front of a 100 m long downhill track.
The student of the fourth year of medicine John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill track, but that it was really daunting.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city down.
There were some of the best skiers and snowbordisses from all over the country - some of them real talents,\" he added.
The prices were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After Thursday night’s race, the snow was left to melt.
They and We
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minerets, and in general, alarm reports are spreading about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic who wrote and informed and thought about whether Muslims could integrate into one of the continent’s most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author’s latest work, “Why the French don’t like headscarfs” (2006), this elegant and debated study on the disputed issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose consequences are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the basics.
He spent months in mosques, schools, and institutes that now care for 5 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls ‘Islamic Spaces’.
He is a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them the most.
Should Muslims enter a marriage union in a mosque or a town hall (or both places)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seem to be the world’s controversial questions that are discussed, and that are part of everyday life rather than the political drama that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers, and intellectuals, among others widely known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, Arab, a Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion about how one can be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen has interviewed will adhere to the house that these are anti-pola Selafi’s opponents of the Sunni Islamic Purist, associated in Saudi Arabia, but this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He asks himself how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so fervently defends the lay public) are actually devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found that he had drawn the screws of values.
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may tend to say “Yes, but not now”
The most enjoyable prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than any other planet's environment.
Restricting ice hides alarming speeds, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural resources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book “On the Thin Ice”, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, a polar bear.
Well-known for the complicated history and practices of whalery, he describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to take possession of a white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with the cobblestone is really a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears, who were swimming behind their dead mothers' bodies, were caught and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared at once in one circus tent.
Even today, gardens in the zoo typically have an area of millions of times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wilderness. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the Hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of species.
Even though hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted from helicopters and Indians on skis, and they are all armed with powerful assault towels to shoot off their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the biggest.
In his new book, “After Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and uncomfortable responsibility of science for the Arctic and an eye-catching glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.
It's because of the lack of tests.
The research routes of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century indicated for the first time how the movement of floating ice occurs.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting splits when they were flying.
Satellite exploration and extensive field probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to unsafe individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the fall system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salty water that shrinks when it freezes.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic miracles, all this is condemned to extinction as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, we can be us.'
6,000 Marines put wreaths on graves in Arlington
Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled on a seven-hour bus to put a simple wreath on a soldier's grave that he never met.
For him and the other Marines who made their way from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, that was the day they gave homage to men and women who used to wear the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several departments at the Piedmont Act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a stamping act in Arlington.
Now it is an 18-year-old tradition, when Mr. nMorilla and his wife Karen take this trip every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
Worcestester is not looking for profits, wreaths across America, which they also place in other states.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 wreaths in the Arlington Cemetery, in the Pentagon, in the graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and in the memorial of Flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart’s Foundation has spent more than $10,000 on the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made her way to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to return what the victim was doing.
“It’s a small way for citizens to support our troops,” she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
The volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves of the First and Second World Wars and to war in Vietnam because these are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together as they carried a young pine tree to the cunning tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch of the pice of the upper part.
Close to the section 60, where most veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, are really quiet.
The associated service organizations dedicated 1,000 wreaths to the decoration of the department, but the gloomy mood of the currently underway wars filled this area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cool air.
Some read aloud the names, carved into stones, while others bowed to see the small black and white labels pressed into the wet mud where the tombstones were not yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers to wipe tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
It was eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the site of the last mermaid's rest at the Marine Artillery, David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free...my son paid for it, she said.
“Although I’ve been away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him.”
U.S. government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government jailed a U.S. government supplier who imported cell phones and laptops to the country, according to foreign ministry officials on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. with its registered office in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Department of Interest in Havana, sought access to a detainee who was imprisoned on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as “dangerous”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are tracked and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but was denied permission.
The U.S. supplier’s detention may be the result of a growing tension between the communist Castro’s brother, who reigns in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been watched as a “retention tactics” in improving relations with the island.
First reported on the New York Times incarceration on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used for text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day’s wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
The Cubans, who often want to sign up, must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in Cuba are behind bars for criminal offences, such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, the U.S. Department of Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
The arrests and detentions were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group's program, which recently published an unfavorable report on the freedoms of Cuba, entitled \"New Castro, the same Cuba,\" as an allusion to the installation of Raul Castra as the country's leader and replacement for the stupid older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said all solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative response in the United States, just as these two countries are moving towards a more extensive dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are disclosing the conspiracy regarding the sending of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed an alleged leader of the conspiracy regarding sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops there, and said they hoped that this case could help cover a vast network of terrorists recruiting online and looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a gray rebel personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after they first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment, approving terrorist attacks me on YouTube's video site.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get into the remote area of Pakistan in Pakistan's Indigenous Tribes, home to al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who filed a report on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in testifying al-Qaeda commanders and that men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the horrific mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
Why they were fired was stated by an official who spoke about maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, disembarking those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who could be investigators.
U.S. fake recruiters were subject to special investigation at al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the U.S., said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years in what will allow them to join because U.S. intelligence agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than following their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much?
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday and demanded more action on the climate from the negotiators in Bella’s city convention center.
The protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but the police outnumbered 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid a few small loads near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day when a small incident occurred in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists went through the city and carried banners with English inscriptions “This is not the planet B” (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, which said “Earth says ‘stuff’.”
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the unsatisfied state of the country in which climate change is still taking part.
That is the partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the leadership of the world to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to perform it, it cannot be avoided.
The police prevented the protesters from getting closer to Bella’s center and said they were holding 19 people, primarily because they had either wearing masks or wearing pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in the horns about the climate, activists masked as athletes, and in black clothes laid several charges near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating at the buildings, he said, starting with the lights, but then followed “a few large explosions”
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't get into the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, the English replied, “Actually, that is something that I was not aware of.”
Then he continued in Chinese and said, 'Because the scene is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside.'
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
The focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change is visible, he said.
In other words: “It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal certificate of knowledge from mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public education of Columbia.
Although far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth- and eighth-class pupils over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains behind the latest figures of the National Astration Centre for Progress in Teaching are the persistent differences in the knowledge reached between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result of the fourth-class white students in Columbia in the last two years increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but their African-American peers had only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge gained has actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not encouraging.
The difference between the third-class white and black pupils in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some school advocates in the district said in the last week that the results, celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were more widely stimulated in white students where high results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the support of those on the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of education in the district.
I don’t jump up and down due to a distraction of two or three points, said member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown committee (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade primary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee's administration style, Mrs. Brown said that the report on the results of the test means that high schooling in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros and I respect it.
But what’s amazing is that we didn’t devote almost no time and energy to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said the district’s efforts were to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of low-result students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new curriculum readings, Wilson’s reading system, aimed at students of higher classes of primary schools and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their knee careers significantly lagging behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and mathematics curriculum into the sixth grade, emphasizing games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the NAEP progress reported last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and do the best possible intervention for those students who remain below the class level, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP's results clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain awarded dilemma of Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of Columbia.
In this way, the focus can bring political soundings that are directed against an important agenda.
But it also belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the middle line between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to strengthen the relationship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to be given excellent public instruction.
Mr. Janey, now director of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to realize the eligibility of schools.
You need to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who entered into a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers to be “a symptom” to search for a larger increase in the next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
The bus went to Gettysburg College with a loud rest.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, stood out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracialine’s parents have been hard to graduate from El Salvador.
To date, Graciala herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the ground of the college.
Now she and other 8th grade students in the group examined Gettysburg, where the school was $38690 a year, their status was rather than scared visitors excited by potential students.
Yes! That's it! called Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
She said thoughtfully when they revealed to them a low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven that they visited on their three-day tour and were now fully interested in the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a supporting problem concerning the high number of babies born to Spanish immigrants who are excluded from colleges or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive secondary education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this “long generation” of Spanish college students, remarkable results have shown that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, have reached the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, researchers say, because it underlines their point of the way forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the field of the labour force of the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they have had a natural inclination to school and an innate persuasion and an effort to succeed.
Many parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciale and millions of children who would like to graduate from college - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool network in all ways to go through college.
The federal program that funded the Graciely tour on the tracks is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run railway preparatory programs that start for students from small-income groups in high school and continue until these students complete colleges.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom entered the college, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to force major oil companies to rebuild their indomitable infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, stunned by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies have left with capital participation in just two out of 10 fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one offered a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached an agreement on a field that was auctioned in June.
U.S. oil giants’ share in the open-ended Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the way to Asiatics and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, online news.
It will be a long time before anything else is available for sale in Iraq.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to discourage U.S. companies from a much more intense business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third largest raw materials reserves, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more vulnerable to risk because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to have concluded agreements with the Ministry.
Leading U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have kept close contacts with the Iraqi Department of Oil and have offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were allocated at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic as well as technological force, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Department of Oil Industry.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to competition and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit tenders that were then compared by the Ministry by price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level on each field.
Al-Qaeda's top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
When the U.S. missile hit the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, al-Qaeda’s top planner, according to U.S. counter-terrorist department officials, was reportedly killed.
As confirmed, it could be a second deadly attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets fell on their cars on Thursday near the city of Miran Śah in the province of Sevvern Vaziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have found that missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type with which the CIA operates in the zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were led to a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, a police officer, along with Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, who was calling from Miran Shah said.
The official said the local militants had moved to the point and quickly seized what was left of “totally destroyed bodies”
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorist department officials quoted an unspecified witness who said Somalia was a poi of death.
Somali was listed as a high-ranking planning officer of al-Qaeda military operations, which managed operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan and Pakistani areas.
He was involved in snowmaking around the world, said a senior official who does not want to be appointed, who stated the sensitive nature of American air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al Qaeda’s highest leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was fast progressing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking al-Qaeda leader or Taliban to be killed since September, when the Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the zone of indigenous tribes and three other top poperative leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has decreased from an average of approximately six operations per month per month to two, according to the records of the Long War, a website managed by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing those suspected to be whistleblowers.
The U.N. delegate to Kabul resigned.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would like to resign from his office in March and end the turbulent term of office, which was fraught with allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the president in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure takes place because the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegation said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a reduction in the state of 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed on the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The rise on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's time to look after the successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban began to seek compensation.
Officials said it was a decision between Staffan di Mistura, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenne, a French man who had previously conducted UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the Earth's presidential election from masking the presence of massive electoral machineries.
Eide denied these claims, but said Galgraith's charges -- which was released -- were \"certainly damaged by the mission, because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to the international intervention - in the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens to coordinate efforts to lead the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to borrow them for the Afghan mission, so he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide said he was disappointed to limit his efforts in Afghanistan and said the UN’s difficult-to-use hiring regulation undermines its ability to exploit its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot continue.
Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world’s powers will soon impose more significant sanctions on Iran due to lack of engagement in talks about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a weekly trip to areas where Afghanistan and Iraq are warring, downplayed the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in an answer to a soldier's question about the likely development.
One thing that depends on me is whether I’ve learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inevitable unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that “a package of incentives and barriers” would require the Iranian government to really feel less secure with nuclear weapons because their inhabitants will suffer extremely by sanctions.
According to a White House spokesperson, Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in warning that Iran will suffer serious consequences unless it puts its nuclear programme fully in line with the UN’s nuclear security committee and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists on developing its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In an interview in Geneva on 1 October, he suggested he wanted to go back to talks about limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his uranium-enriched stock in exchange for urgently needed fuel for a reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the provisional agreements - partly because of this, the expert states, because the Iraqi leadership is divided into views on whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, when it comes to Iranian stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals with which it really agreed at the beginning of October, I think that this has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a journey that is not about terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to search for other elections, including surveillance, which Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In an opinion issued in New York, Iran’s UN mission on Thursday condemned what it called “unfounded and unfounded accusations” against some members of the Iranian nuclear security committee and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the Kurdistan area, rich in oil, to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions persist between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to prevent U.S. plans from limiting the number of U.S. troops from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to reduce Kurdish concern about persistent depression, citing Gates, when he told Massoud Barzaani, the president of the Kurdish regional government: “We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you -
In ancient China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that “Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children” and “One child, moreover, means one grave extra.”
Then they learned that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and aging populations in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always spent all our time and energy on just one child.
We kept nothing for others, says Wang, 31, a human resource manager who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years of China’s policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations of only notoriously turbulent and exterminated children, affectively nicknamed “small emperors”, the country is threatening the population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy came into force, according to UN data.
The population distribution, where the population at the age of 60 and above is predicted to rise from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is a larger rich coastal city with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the number of workforces in the future”
He says it's about being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden --
Gradual calming
As it was introduced into the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever imposed under the rule of the Communist Party.
The two who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official sites have enforced a policy that has helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in policy enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion in the second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist abortions leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been milder in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including residents of cities, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were singles - and in 2007 they mitigated the dictation of their passwords, promoting hard lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Peking University’s Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes than allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was the only one.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign for incitement to multiple births.
Almost overnight there were posters, encouraging parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be entitled to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and push leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
The Regretting Response
Although officials in one rural city around Shanghai reported an increase in interest among couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign started, most urban districts did not report any changes.
Huinan City District with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai quarter of Caolu, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like two children and be legally allowed.
But like many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a full network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west judge one child’s policy badly as a question of law, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in a relationship with the first child in the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were tired of the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples mention psychological reasons of hesitation.
Wang, a human resource manager, says that they want only one child, because she was also the only one: “We were the center of our families’ attention and they were all taking care of us.
We were not used to provide care, and in fact we did not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who has expressed this much more incredulously.
For middle-class two-year-olds who have reduced birth rates, he said, to be successful is to be selfish.
Today’s 20 and 30-year-olds look at their parents as the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism, and they don’t want this way of nourishment for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parents’ time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still questionable questions of the propstor -- \"You have to rebuild your apartment -- and strategy --\"You have to have the resume ready at a time when the child is 9 months for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to be satisfied with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don’t want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unrelenting attitudes and peer-to-peace -- refocused on Friday to release a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the near future.
The text that can provide a starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation emphasizes the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was an important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unobtrusively states how much money a wealthy country should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This will give the process a great amount of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Washington Club.
Michael Zammmit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, styling from 180 pages of the text from the negotiations to focus on what the top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a “big picture”
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
On Friday, the European Union discussed its promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries accept adaptations to climate change -- from flooding and drought to preventing deforestation.
On Friday, however, he introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in talks last week.
The U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Todd Stern has rejected the speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrial countries compared to the voluntary use of major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration had established harder lines against China, running officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of the actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the U.S. chief negotiators about climate issues that either lack of “Selian reason” or “extreme irresponsibility” had led earlier this week to a statement that the U.S. would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of economic pathways of the world’s major powers at stake, the tensions broke out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world’s most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to carry out stronger actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers responsible for their actions.
It is clearly a game about the development of the new economic hegemony, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor in the area of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation of nature.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to enforce legally binding agreements in Copenhagen, but most of the major participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said enforcement by small island nations has triggered a political push to the entire polar process - partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations sparked a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining disputed issues before the heads of government fought for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as the Indian Minister of Environmental Protection, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, have stepped out of the aircraft and have gone through Bella centers to closed doors of meetings and new conferences, so they could make claims that will be assessed next week.
The absolute breadth of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved from and to the congress center every day, to guitars playing the activists staged at night an turbulent look at the countries they thought they had sent them, and there was a hand-in-hand transmission on paper rather than electronic mail -- controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is only an extension: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We are in high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Nature Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first British train at 140 miles per hour was shooting this Monday's feelings.
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the stars cut the darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which marked the revolution of transport in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed passenger train reaches 140 miles an hour and flies from Ashford, Kent to London’s St Pancras and exceeds 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal suite outside of the LLndyn.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomeration of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Forgotten standing water should shorten traffic times in passenger transport and on business roads, and the transition from aircraft and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate traffic jams on roads.
Theoretically, the three major political parties were given this vision.
But the tens of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasible study, passed its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to Times.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route between London and West Midland was designed up to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where the environment could be problematic.
The open landscape was planned to reach 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also assumes to determine three options for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option is to conficuate the shape of the letter Y, when one high-speed line should lead to the western Midland.
The line should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One route should lead to Scotland.
“It seems to have been the most powerful choice,” he said, and a railway expert.
Once done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh are reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to travel at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already designed to hijack trains of 400 m long that would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand in such a way as to understand the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will report whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if the wheels are moving, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a crucial point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an orientation point for the railway revolution.
Tax payers pay £75,000 on Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the holder of Tory’s front seat bench in the House of Deputies, paid the taxpayers thousands of pounds last year for the orangery he built in his house in the constituency.
The party spokesperson for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived “out of allocations,” raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build a oak-clad extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The general authorities approved the claims in time and so was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the inspection of the member expenditures. Last night, Mr. Duncan made his demands - it was supposed to be cleaner or easier -
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is described as ‘orangery’ in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a ‘glasshouse for fun and hospitality’
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for an increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The Committee informed him last month that it had broken the rules after reviewing its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupillary security to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the Chamber of Deputies.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately £1400 a month for mortgages until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than £1800 per month.
The interest of RBS repayments of Mr Duncan's mortgage could not change at this time, indicating that it was all intended to finance a £75000 loan.
The standard variable for RBS mortgage payments fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, with it remaining.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 this month in May.
Mr Duncan left his job as a shadowy head of the House in September after a secret rapporteur filmed it and said that MPs had to survive - on a allocation - after a scandal of spending.
In principle, it is nationalized, you have to live on a allocation and treat you as a s**t
He said: “I spent money for my garden and my claim and a small fraction for what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I wouldn't do it.
A Member, a millionaire from a former career as a oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May when it turned out he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority that this - may be considered excessive -
One of the activists kicked out a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Mr. Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about an increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: “It was due to the increase in capital, which was approved by both the Financial Office and then Legg.”
He added: “This is not a question of hiding and clicking or breaking rules or something else.
It's absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, justified and that's all.
It wouldn’t have been much easier or cleaner than that.
Come and see all chats on the Brighton coast with an Advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton found a new sense of life in the middle months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative ecclesiastical group that encourages the ducious lives of creativity has called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas collets as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, allowing visitors to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and bishop's bread and welded wine, provided for free.
I Saw Three Ships, O Come, About Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage was the work of Janetty Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant to television marketing from Hove, is a non-scientific priest in the Diocese of Chicago and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
“Why should we, as a church, expect people to come into a foreign old building? I feel that the Church should come to people and serve in a awakening way.
The idea of an Advent calendar in the chat rooms was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and vibrant place, and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand, according to the organizers, manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement on Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said the increasing global mobilization, which is clearly evidenced by the current manifestations, contributed to the “political tax” of possible failure in Copenhagen.
According to a journalist, the incident occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the procession began, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break the expenses with paving cubes and hammers.
The police immediately hit.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and said it was a member of the Blacks Blocks, an ultra-radical separate group that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition, one of the event’s organizers, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals, no matter what, were arrested, and stressed that about a hundred of them had been held in bonds and in a seat in the streets on Saturday evening, despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade was peacefully heading towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which there was a spiritual meeting at candles with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue coats, created the first assembly in Copenhagen in the morning to challenge the Friends of the Earth group who wanted to create blue waves for a fair climate.
Today we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of ecological debt in favor of the south, explained the People of Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say, \"It's time,\" said Beninian singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water streams are drying out, today we can walk in them, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the struggle movement for a different world was closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the struggle for another world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of “promoting climate and social justice”: “There is currently no difference between fighting against global warming and fighting for another world.”
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate change.
About 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with scarves evocating the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators came out to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protests organized by the “350” movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Several dozen people met in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its president, Georgia condemns it as a “fresh”
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step to be a ‘frash’.
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections following the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Election rooms were closed in 17 hours GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closure of the electoral rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President Sergey Bagaps, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned these elections.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili is sorry that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination,” said Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, they recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants only Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After a separation from Georgia, after a conflict between 1992 and 1993, in which several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia tries to show through elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said Kvarčija Světlanová, 54-year-old historian, who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote for an election room in the school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the shore of the Black Sea, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagaps are deployed next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful course of the election had been warmly accepted by the district mayor Beslan Aršba.
“We, Abkhaz, are grateful,” he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow’s support and, in particular, her decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament and drank a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutbou, criticized the agreements concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or opposition.
To win the election, a half majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieve this result, a decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to the organizers, manifested the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade was peacefully heading towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which there was a spiritual meeting at candles with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to a journalist, the incident occurred shortly after the departure of the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed with cells in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break the expenses.
The police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, while several manifestos collided to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and said it was a member of the Blacks Blocks, an ultra-radical separate group that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Later in the afternoon, a police officer on the jaw was injured and four cars near the Squat near the incidents that resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We focus on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters flew back into the air.
Most of the protesters who came by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue coats, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning to challenge Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create blue waves for a fair climate.
Today we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of ecological debt in favor of the south, explained the People of Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the struggle for another world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of “promoting climate and social justice”: “There is currently no difference between fighting against global warming and fighting for another world.”
Oxfam has called several well-known personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate change.
About 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, hundreds of people were manifested in front of the capital city of the Philippines, mostly students in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with the demand for a strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protests organized by the “350” movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Several dozen people met in Geneva.
The subject matter of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general high school, said Chatel.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview with the JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium - although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week, and for all there will be the same program from the general culture, says Chatel.
According to the minister, it is necessary to end hypocriticalism - because specialization S no longer focuses on exact science - but - basically, the best students are in it -
EC and L specializations cannot be for With some sub-specializations, he continues and emphasizes: “I have not brought many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of professional high schools, geography and history are not taught.”
The Ifop survey, which published the Humanité newspaper on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagree with the government’s project to abolish the mandatory teaching of history and geography in the S-specialization year, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this cancellation, both the left and some members of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that he “does not come into consideration” to abolish philosophy in the specialization program of the S-year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in teaching, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilization against this project, which according to them offers pedagogical education to future high school professors.
As part of the Master's Degree 2 (M2), he will undergo an admission exam at the beginning of the year, focusing on their field and at the end of the year, another examination verifying their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of the Master's degree and will perform as a professor-trainer for the first year before the pupils.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you prior to the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, you will continue.
The minister also announced that he would propose a \"personal right to education\" which does not exist in national education.
The project was reconfirmed on the school map until 2012.
At École’s elite university, the experts have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
15 minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, the multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC), announced in the Council’s morning on the initiative of the University of Ecole’s normal supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one journalist told AFP, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the “Ernest” conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and on the basis of which they would like to learn more, explained on the occasion of the 22-year-old conference Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who received the name by fish from the local lake, which was named by the students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specify that the choice is based on their charisma.
“We can talk about climate warming for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes,” said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-prepared notes, using only graphs.
It’s part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that the Copenhagen Conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific foundation.
Videos recorded at these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next “Ernest” seminar is scheduled for February and the next one will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
The prison supervisors announced on Friday - general mobilization - as they demand that bonuses and overtimes be paid to them on Christmas holidays, whose reimbursement was postponed for financial reasons for January.
Prisoners’ FO (2nd Department of Supervisors) have asked employees who will not have the service to participate in a demonstration held Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities, and to “block them” to warn them of “steal their wages”
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd branch of the sector) is encouraged to “call assembly in individual prisons and launch a major mobilization, with the fact that it is “defamatory and unacceptable” so that “times and allowances for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays” are not paid in December.
First Supervisory Union (Ufap/Unsa) - calls for overall mobilization... in order to manifest dissatisfaction and indignation -
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of redundancies increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the debt amounts will be paid in January.
The law firm said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison guards’ unions to assure them that the payment would be made next month.
I know about the efforts that prison personnel make to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the minister writes in a statement.
I ordered the administration of the prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which has been caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtimes, has never been repeated again in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari said.
Therefore, the December wage will be low, with the exception of executives who receive the famous premium for performing the functions and fulfilling the goals, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those who are always in the budget, there is always a place to be found -
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille has been indignant, and it has announced its decision to boycott in appealing - all the meetings and provocations -
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, if they are not paid extra fees for these days of October in December, as well as for overtimes, there is also a risk of FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when more and more jobs are being given to us, without giving us additional staff, it is sad to be able to pay the lowest employees for it, according to the CGT Prison Supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds of Jer little, said Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he’s giving “better gifts” at Christmas than the ones he receives.
U.S. President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, said: “I give better gifts than the ones I receive.”
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening at the ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-legged companion of the family gets his share.
Jesus loves Boa too, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog will also, of course, receive a gift, as follows from the extracts from the pre-release broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also opposed her husband’s claim about the quality of the gifts she receives: “I certainly didn’t, I gave you good gifts last year,” she said.
Well, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but right after that, he pointed his finger at the first lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you this?”
In this one-day, very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who has strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also talked about their unpopular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball ball, which was given to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and how he gave me the basketball ball, the president said.
Only a long time later did I realize that the ball was actually given to me by him.
The first lady remembered the doll house.
I didn’t know how to organize it all in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little doll house,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's Artificial Sleeping
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for \"injury\" after a larger operation he had done in France, but the situation is under control according to his closest -- while the RTL station reported that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. physicians stated “injury resulting from the operation” of the heated plate, which he had done in Paris on November 26, told his press department in Paris, saying these lesions required a “correct” operation.
However, the singer’s press department tried to calm the public and said the situation was “under control” and at the same time announced that a new medical communication would be issued by 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we will have a little bit more security, adds RTL.
The press department, on request of AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that after the first operation in Paris, there was no drent.
Rocker was operated at the international clinic Parc Monicaau due to a heated plate.
The operation, which was planned a few days in advance, was carried out by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the information provided by the RTL.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for the infection that occurred after the intervention.
Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday that his friend was going through a bad period, but he added that he was not worried about the rocker - because he's a big fightr.
He called me just before he went to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, said that Johnny Hallyday was responding well to antibiotics and that the infection was ‘stopped’.
Mr. Camus also said he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he did not notice any special concerns.
The singer’s health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone’s surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a “small tumor of the small intestine” and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour, Tower 66, which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been closely monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to dement the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large pool, won the European Championship 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline he especially likes: 50m in a free way.
The first day of the championship, on which the suits are last allowed, fell only three world records, although much more was expected.
One of them overcame the Hungarian racer Evilin Verrasztová on a 200 m position race and two other men's stadiums of Russia at a 4x50 m positioning race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who made the world record at 50 m in a free way, which he already holds in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, 50m free way, a 28-year-old Frenchman won the final time of 20.53 seconds in the final where ten swimmers started instead of the regular eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Rus Sergey Fesik (20.84), but failed to overcome the world record (20.30) as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record is within my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing a suit made of polyurethane, which will be banned from 1 January.
The combination helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, the first to host them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the suit was not helped by the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the big summer pool in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record that holds the 400-metre-free (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew that this time I would not beat the world record, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent for the future, explained Biedermann.
United States: The novel sarcophagus plate belonging to Zol was auctioned for $1.5 million
The board of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which did not belong to anyone other than French writer Emila Zol, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is much more than estimated, said Sotheby’s art dealer.
The price of this two-meter long and 63 cm high front board, dating from the third century of our year, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Mramor - featuring four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satire and baccanta is a rare work, similar pieces are very few in the world, perhaps four or five, - told AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Auction of Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold between hundreds of others.
Sales are still going on, but it’s an object that was probably the most important, Sotheby’s spokesperson Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola took this marble was detected a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgi family, and then gradually appeared with French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated with it a bath at her private hotel in Paris and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly before the President of the Council came to power by Marshal Petain.
She stayed there for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered in a search of the museum database in Louvre that this album was part of the 'remains of Emilo Zoly', opened from 1903, year after the death of the author - Therese Raquin - and frescoes -Rougon-Macquart -
An intermittent attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico concluded that the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure, were not met.
After a phone call I had with President Zelaya last night, all of it has been evidenced by the fact that there is no way to carry out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos said.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, flew back again, a source from the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The government wanted to force President Zelaya to “demisy” and to ask for political asylum abroad would only give him the chance to leave safely.
But the overthrown president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exiled head of state.
The government of the pupists - has experienced another failure when it wanted me to give up my duties . . . they wanted me to give up the resignation - said Zelaya radio Globo on Thursday, in which he often expresses himself to a political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, delivered the overthrown president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for a safe transfer, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told the Hungarian National Radio.
I will not apply for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the people of Honduras, he stressed.
The announcements of Zelaya's departure were mobilized on Wednesday by a supporter of the overthrown president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the Pupist government.
This shows their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army, and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on September 21st and found refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and will be responsible for the crime - the verde - which he is accused of, the Puchistic government says.
Pubist President Roberto Micheletti was able to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In a controversial election, recognized by the United States, but condemned countries of Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with an increase, and the results of the U.S. trade balance show a rise in both the U.S. and its partners: Dow Jones earned 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
“We have good news coming from different parts of the economy,” said Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, it added, because the market is focused on 'half of the full glass'.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on US trade balance numbers, which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.
The U.S. trade balance deficit fell by 7.6% in October, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
A major innovation is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment increased against all expectations and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has dropped to the lowest this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The yield of state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3,482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield to 30 years increased to 4,492% versus 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime wrote “Women in white”
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime were sent out by the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further manifestations on which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40-Dam in white-wives or close political prisoners were sent directly to the street by supporters of the Raula Castro regime in their march towards the center of the capital with a demand for the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
Away with the Yankees!, ‘Jeorges’, ‘The streets belong to the revolutionaries’, ‘Let Fidel and Raul live,’ chanted the raised fists of supporters of the regime to dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by members of the civilian, who came \"to ensure security\"
The day before this, there was a similar manifestation in Havana against ‘Women in White’, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Vedado district of Havana, about ten dissidents were arrested in the civilian police, who were also about to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police charged dissidents who were sent to government officials into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The holders of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, “Women in White,” organized an illegal march for “freeding everyone according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners,” said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda, is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be \"jails\" or \"agents\" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of the government’s supporters against the “refugees of the revolution”
Cuba with the Communist Party at the forefront and politics of the one-party government is regularly accused of non-respecting human rights and freedoms, including free speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garonne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in Clichy-la-Garonne (Hauts-de-Seine) at a peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man at the pharmacy or in front of her, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A gravely injured old man, born in 1929, died in the hospital from the consequences of the injury, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate.
In this pharmacy or before her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of 30, he began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital in shock, the police source said.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as stated by the police source, then fled to the street, still on Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old man, the other seriously.
As it all happened, it is not clear, because everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two cutting knives, which he carried by the cross behind his back, said at the site of the head of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-bys, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to the AFP-assembled testimony.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young people tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
The crowd, including one city police officer who broke his wrist, threw him away.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest an armed man and were injured with fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garonne, where there are many shops.
The fellows came to tell me that there was a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big wound on my stomach, said Frederic Allion, a thirty-five-year-old son.
Five minutes later, the second about thirty-year-old person came, who also had a stabilizing knife wound.
The man who had no ID was arrested by the state police.
A prosecutor in Nanterre handed over the case to the regional police department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody and waiting for an interview.
A police source did not rule out its location in a psychiatric clinic.
Another police source said six police officers were needed to manage him at the Clicha police station, where he was taken.
He was “fully outside of himself,” like “all the madmen of this type, whose strength increases tenfold in action.”
U.S. lawyer calls again for prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski asked again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director’s attorney-in-chief, criticized three judges of the second California County appeal court for serious errors that occurred in court recalculation at the time of the incident in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and immediately, the lawyer Hummel said, adding that from the behavior of the judge who at the time decided on the matter, Laurence Rittenbanda had freezing in his back.
According to him, a judge (who had already died between him) had reportedly acted with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison - a serious offence against the rule of law.
The information about this interview appeared in the document “Roman Polanski: wanted and desired” (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the public prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September that he was lying to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will ask for a trial in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The applicant repeated what was already said in the first state, namely that there would be no serious examination of an application to stop prosecution until Roman Polanski came to court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court issued a judgment in a case of “illegal sexual intercourse” with a minor girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never again entered the United States.
A representative of the prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski would be there to take part in the trial.
In this case, we want to give not only to Romana Polaski, but also to other defendants that it is possible to flee? asks Mrs Asayam.
In the opinion of the director, he “requires in court the kindness and also disdains its authority.”
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that there are other alternatives to escape.
The lawyer Hummel was not alone who asked to stop the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also re-requested the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case emerges and added: “No one in this room can say that the process was fair.”
Thirty-two years, that's enough.
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. order
After more than two months behind bars, he was released into a home prison in his cottage in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a possible statement.
Wall Street ends without direction, braked by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a direction, the market is diverging between indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance he left 0.55 points and finished at 2.190.31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by publishing economic indicators that are better than expected and that have “helped to improve market mood in terms of economic recovery stability,” said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales grew by 1.3% in November, the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the confidence of American consumers has also returned, and in December it has increased strongly to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
The indexes, however, have been braked by a new rise in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, pushing down economic-sensitive sectors,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology is losing its ground under its feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield of state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a view to 30 years, it increased to 4.497% on the day before.
Miss World is again in South Africa.
After a monthly trip across South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are going to go beyond the target to achieve their dream: to be elected by the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty took place in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year, and so far five candidates have gained a step into the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariata Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Mae of Canada were elected to Miss Sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was the true faith of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've got so many experiences!
The competition, which takes place in South Africa after the ninth time, will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from the 17th hour (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country where I put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, and Miss World of Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its countries, which exudes breath.
After months of performances, exams, meeting with the press and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to take the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, which also took part in the election by Aishwarye Rai, the winner of 1994, who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will present themselves in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimwear.
The performance will be presented by Chinese television moderator Angela Chow, the former beauty queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and the chairman of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is able to welcome a world of warmth that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
Like last year, the candidates took part in Safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and tried local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
For the president unusual, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I didn't even dream of.
I'm sure I'm going back to the 2010 World Cup, she says with the enthusiasm of Miss Italy Alice Tataci.
According to David’s son, Hallydaye’s status reports are very positive.
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are \"very positive\" as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the Los Angeles airport, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday when he left the plane, which arrived from Paris just after the 13th hour of local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer’s son, who worked calmly, said he would arrive at Los Angeles’s Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where he was admitted to Johny Hallyday on Monday due to a post-operative infection following an operation of a heated intervertebral plate, which he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, this night in Los Angeles was brought into artificial sleep to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles already put into artificial sleep. Hospitalization occurred due to an infection following an operation of a heated intervertebral plate carried out on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at night.
According to AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of French lycea in Los Angeles on Friday morning.
Prioritizing the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Hospital of La Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, announced that he would fly to the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer heavily accused Dr. Stéphana Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday has gone too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon.
Personally, I spoke to the doctor by phone and he assured me that this journey was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I had already suffered twice from the heating of the intervertebral plate, he added.
A while ago, at the radio station RTL, he said that the singer apparently flew after a Paris operation without a drone, without anything -
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where she worked.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of a hematoma resulting from bleeding into the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, sentenced several times in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber Olivier Metzner referred to him as “a man without a scrupulous”, who, on a regular basis, is called in front of the medical chamber, and which cannot be recommended at all times.”
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday about the matter through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had - totally good course - and the post-operative examination was -normal -
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so it was not necessary to introduce the marrow,” he added.
The singer’s health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with the question mark.
It is clear that the deadline for the restoration of the scheduled tour on January 8 (In Amiensu, a.k.a.) appears too close, Camus said.
The UDF Association enhances the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to continue not to use their abbreviation.
UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded on Friday to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to take the shortcuts of the former Giscard party, saying that the abbreviation must not be used in any medium under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to adopt UDF, with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her inheritance after he handed his hand to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This move was supported by Hervé de Charetta (former za-UMP now under the NC), who owns the UDF brand because he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprieté industrialelle).
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association Committee, led by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to be evicted, left his silence and filed a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and hand back the ownership of the trade mark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised a worrying statement that you will propose to your political movement to take over the + UDF shortcut, the Association writes in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centre.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name + Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF today+, the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC-immediately to remove all references to the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (your) websites.
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette to hand over ownership of the trade mark to legitimate owners.
If you do not do so, we will contact the courts to respect the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories point out.
In their letter, they state that UDF is a full-fledged political movement since 1978, and reminds that Mr. Morin and his friends have \"elected\" leaving in 2007 to create a competitive movement, just like others in 2002, to establish UMP.
Thus, the Nouveau Centre has no right to use UDF (Union pour la démocratie francaise).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to form a committee responsible for defending moral and material interests, an association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charettea is concerned, the Committee continues, “when he registered the trade mark, he has not been a member of UDF for three years,” but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent registration of the FLAC to do so on his own account.
This inaccuracies begin to turn into a crime, they declare, and then ironically comment on the NC strategy: ‘It seems to us that both in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to get out of anonymity by deceiving a name that we do not have a right to.’
Liliane Bettencourt's case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
On Friday, Nanterre’s court decided to judge François-Marie Banier and rule out whether she had used the state of weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to lose her part of her fortune, and her daughter Liliane Bettencourt is guilty of it.
Photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of the famous, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a crime for which a penalty is imposed for a maximum of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros.
This decision confirms that there will actually be a process in the case, which can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and her daughter are attacked and struggled to control the L'Oréal beauty empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by a college of three doctors.
L'Oréal's grandfather and chief shareholder have always refused such an examination, not under the conditions offered by Nanterre's public prosecutor during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time give a statement as to whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think he's going to go through it.
I'll talk to her after the hearing, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said.
As for lawyer François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
It is an excellent report(...). Expertise will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and omniscient who has been guilty of using the state of weakness of her mother for many years in order to obtain a donation of billion euros in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or images of masters.
But Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday’s court hearing turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters, which his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, and in which she expressed her distrust towards her husband Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt adds: “You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Since she got married, I’ve never been able to talk to Françoise.
The Nantere State Prosecutor’s Office once again found that the proceedings of the applicant were not justified, even more so that the guardian’s judge rejected her request to initiate proceedings for legal protection for her mother on those days.
Liliane Bettencourt is completely capable of taking part in the court, not under protection or custody.
“No one else will act for her,” the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney, said in a statement.
Finally, the court ruled that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to comment at the time of the trial.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was useless.
For more than a decade, the management behaviour of large companies towards employees has reminded us of the company’s approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about identifying ourselves with “values” from the mountain, as was the case before when it was necessary for consumers to impose products that came from ideas from the heads of factory technicians.
By becoming the centre of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the market capture strategy in the right direction...even if authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, are regularly returning!
A passive approach of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA, and Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that mainly affects managerial cadres.
This demobility adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI - calls for an active approach and an ability to anticipate - from all stakeholders - and requires employees to make commitments that are completely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a management revolution that aims to place workers at the centre of the company’s interest as well as the client.
Relative usefulness of internal polls of public opinion.
Internal polls of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will they contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after various turns will return preferentially to what it has always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their mental comfort, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, currently re-enlived by neurosciences, from the United States, and abundantly disseminated without greater knowledge by scientific institutes and media.
With the ability to move around with managers (sic) involved, Ipsos’ recent survey on Figaro.fr, which only confirms managers in their position of mechanical management, inappropriate for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises assumes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating basic insight into all objectives and practices of management: For employees, commitments to the enterprise will only be possible if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation deals only with the study of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined dox that allows them, through an image that tells them about an enterprise, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict, and anticipate on their “social performances” and bring their human resource management to the right path.
This creates a living ground for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
In a statement from Oslo: ‘Just War’, Obama earned praise from the right hand.
On Friday, the American Right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech the day before in Oslo, contented with the fact that the Nobel Peace Prize winner for 2009 defended the concept of “fair war” against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who at first mocked Obama for the award of the award on October 9th, made a point this time, including Sarah Palin, a former vice president in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the museum of the right-wing republican wing, for the newspaper USA Today, and added that she had expressed herself on this topic - sometimes necessary - of war in her memories that are currently coming out.
War, of course, is the last thing Americans would like to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorGeorge W. Bush, justified the sending of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Obama's next opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a very good job in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who appreciated the President’s mention of “the existence of evil in the world.”
In a way, I thought this speech was quite historical, Gingrich said during a radio interview, “The Takeaway.”
A former MP, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the “left-wing president” reminding the members of the Committee for the Nobel Prize, that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace if the use of force did not exist.
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush’s speech, now editor of Washington Post, Obama has given “very American speech”
Not only did he present himself as a “world citizen” as he always did, but he “said as the US president” and reminded the Europeans that they were living in a safe bubble they didn’t create themselves, and that they didn’t do too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
A few dissatisfied right-handers include the Bush era hawk, a former UN ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as “a single, bulky and without inspiration”, according to the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified when he looks at Barack Obama, as he excuses the use of forces.
“When we wrap the war in the packaging of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the middle-left press holds a praiseful position on the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers the award of peace to Obama to be premature, it has assessed its output as ‘overperformance’, even for a speaker known to his talents.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guideline to international conflict resolution decisions, in the fight against poverty and oppression.
Obama, speaking as needed, assessed the New York Times, and described the speech as simple and instructive.
Road carriers: three marathons to the deal that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, road transport and TLF unions, the only employers’ organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, on Friday's signing of the agreement, expressed “joy” after a few negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the debate, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned.
But there was a need for an additional more than six hours of meeting, which started at 11 o'clock, so that everyone could agree and at 18 o'clock signing the agreement.
This conflict, which would greatly hurt businesses, would threaten to disrupt holidays at the end of the year, Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (International transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but there is a lot of effort behind it, explains Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we'll give our members orders not to block, no blockages of supply centers.
But there may be several opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed the “right agreement”, although it was difficult to admit an increase in salaries due to the international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed a historic agreement.
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a “acceptable compromise”
The agreement also foresees a revalorisation of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow to focus on the 13th salary issue and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the reduction of €100 million in corporate wages taxes, which was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 draft budget law, which was voted on on Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a \"consistent\" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of this organisation, later to the entire field, in the case of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
As soon as possible, he assured Bussereau.
The whole process can only discourage the disapproval of employers' organisations.
FNTR talks about ‘bad trade’ because €100 million has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to be angry with turkeys at the time of the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
Otre threatens to hold an agreement in the next 12 months - to bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field -
RER A suburban trains: break of traffic on the weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP’s proposals.
The interruption of transport on the RER A line of suburban trains, which is the largest line of urban public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday’s negotiations between trade unions and RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any specific results on the issue of a premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only travel between 10 and 20 o’clock, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) each other train will ride, outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection with the SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP has been trying to secure links with large business houses”
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP-managed section leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday there was one train in service from two and practically no set was driving outside the top of the clock as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things because students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up about 'hours and a half earlier to make sure he arrived on time.'
Saint-Lazare Station was not overcrowded, SNCF State Railway announced, as more set-up and order guards were predicted.
RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of z or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
Other general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will assess the results of Friday afternoon’s meeting with the leadership, which trade unions rated as ‘weak’.
RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all respects, working time adjustment, career course, etc.
This is not the case for drivers who demand a premium, according to Thierry Garon.
RATP has even delayed premium proposals, which has made CGT worse, with leadership not being able to solve the problem, while for travel carriers and SNCF it was possible -
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, the conditions for the performance of the profession will be reviewed, RATP said.
Which was the reason why trade unionists thought the company would make weekend passengers funny.
In the morning, about 150 drivers were taken over by an enterprise committee in its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore, in the interest of “relaxing”, decided to meet.
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday after Unsa and the Independent announce a strike alert.
Trade unions demand a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Indépendants (Independent)) and make it difficult for the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports a million passengers daily.
Drivers of RER suburban trains earn between 2200 and 2700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey’s justice has dissolved the Kurdish side and this decision has severe consequences.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on the abolition of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protest é demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly make the government’s task of giving the Kurdish community a friendly hand and trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a “hate of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Hasim Kilic, president of the Supreme Court, told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority-seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its President Ahmet Türk and Aysela Tugluková, are banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which was used by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluco and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 seats in Parliament (of 500).
The party’s leadership warned before the verdict that MEPs would rather leave Parliament than act as non-political Members.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the cassation court Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the \"commands\" of the Working Kurdistan Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no “base link” with the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The ruling comes when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK to end the conflict.
DTP’s leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in the south-east of Anatolia, where many demonstrations have collapsed in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the ruling was announced, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, which mainly houses the Kurds.
Police used tear pomegranates and water cannons, protesters threw Molotov cocktails or shot stones from washing machines.
Hundreds of people were also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict was delivered, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice would only - deepen despair -
Turkey cannot resolve this question by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We are based on the principle against interference of the parties.
Nothing to do with it, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete shot at the democratic proposals launched by the government, political scientist Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can expect a response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK filed for one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
Snow can come
Nicely blazing winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he would like to bully citizens, says the head of the FES’s winter technical services department.
But in order for his staff to be able to test and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time in the weekend, according to meteorologists.
It is ready for over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt's full area and temperatures fall below zero, it will go to 20 so-called sections of the A-sizer, Brauburger explains.
These sections include the main and crossing lanes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse.
But also arrivals for firefighters, lines of suburban public transport, pedestrian zones and sections with declines like Atzelbergstrasse.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which holds better, about 1040 kilometers.
That’s why the FES starts at three o’clock at night, so that the roads are free when the transport starts to work.
It’s hard when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, \"because no one is willing to make a place for the sympagne.\"
Only when it does not snow so much are there a number of incoming and interconnecting communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES will go on their way, and dangerous places and passages will be cleaned.
FES usually can't take care of all the bikes.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that tracks from 22 to 4.30 mainly bridges, says Brauburger.
As the refrigerator is formed on them quickly, the spreaders come out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
Police will also call them if necessary.
Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal two meters long and 1.50 meters tall ran on two strong back limbs, had a elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sputumy claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, nothing would be extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt, from the University of Texas, Austin, and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science, writes that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical traits.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in modern-day New Mexico, which was then found in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about related relationships, enlargements and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, that is unprecedented for settlements from the triasso, reports a member of the team of Randy Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of five individuals.
The study confirms the early history of dinosaurs.
The name “Tawa” comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: ‘Fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are very rare, mostly only individual fragments are found.
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In today’s scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is usually questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when the dachshunds split into three most important development lines: carnivorous terrapods, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, “long-blooded” four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (birds), which included, for example, Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues' original therapy.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of aeronautical bags, which also descendants of the terrapods have birds.
Thanks to airbags, bird breathing is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randy Irmis.
Since the relative lines of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, it has already created this useful innovation, probably the common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the known most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America so far, scientists have suggested that they first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were split early and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time, as a supercontinent, were made up of a uniform earth mass.
She would also say that the team found, together with Tawa hallae, the remains of two others, not particularly closely related to theopods.
The three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We think there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonnian paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, and on other continents they are rarely found.
As the dinosaurs proved, the relatively rare sideline of the plaza family evolved to ruling vertebrates on earth during the time of the Earth’s Middle Ages remains a puzzle.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other plasms, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying nipples and countless other nipples.
Around the end of the triasso, dinosaurs have spread around the world and have developed many new species, while relatives have extinct and the interface of the triasso and the jury.
The history of success did not last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinctions that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not plazas.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, another group of animals helped the meteorite impact, which has also evolved into a trias and has since lived in the shade: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
Associates from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearance of the occupied Goethe University’s Frankfurt casino took care of the global upheaval.
278 professors and educators at Goeth University, but also colleges across Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English - they do not approve - I preside over an incited police intervention.
Because the walls and works of art were darkened, the university president, Werner Müller-Estler, let the building be cleaned up last week by betting students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
Damage to the matter, judged by signatories, does not justify “violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teaching police commanders”
Clearing is an unacceptable intervention in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “unlawfulness and criminalize protest” and distracts attention from content.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
Authorized protest
The youth of the trade union organisation Verdi and the German trade union are also solidarityd by students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is currently defending the progress of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said Thursday at the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Council.
We have an understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a member of the Earth’s House for the CDU.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Line saw it.
The CDU takes the painted walls behind the excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of addressing the arguments and requirements of the students, there was a clean-up.
The line filed a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, they paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants is considered, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, the Russian Silicon Valley.
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers.
Since September 2008, Greengrad representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the University institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits to one another, and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg-Protocol on close cooperation.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow’s multi-star Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, for Frankfurt signed the lead planning referent Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to join the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called \"socialistic planned city\" for armed research.
Zelenograd (literal translation of the Green City) gained its name according to the forested hillous landscapes in which research facilities are set.
Stuttgart Brake
Stuttgart 21 cannot be prepared enough.
For project supporters, this is simply the “new heart of Europe”
S21 is more than running a station, more than a monstrous building that will throw Baden-Württemberg’s capital into desperate building chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway stations, which ended up in the city centre, were then considered a 19th-century transport-technical fossil, which acts as brakes of modern rail transport, as it took an enormous amount of time to push the locomotives from behind.
To drive, to stop for a while, to go on - so it should work.
And that's why the head station disappears: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which is located about half of the route of the trans-European railway bus between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - this slogan about the \"heart of Europe\"
It really starts with S21, although the vision of the 1980s is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have come to know that in the Hessen and Bavarian capitals, the start of the building is almost unfunded.
Since there have been modern shuttle trains with motor and steering vehicles at both ends, the head stations have no longer had problems with driving and driving.
However, Stuttgart 21 begins, including the new ICE line to Ulm.
This was done by local and local politicians.
Railways work together, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state-owned company.
The project can be apologized in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe computer images of designers - will contain many greens.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit stations and the construction of the track are designed for passenger transport, which, typically in the 1980s, attributed a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policies must first of all be to strengthen freight transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than a truck on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to sharp climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects a lot of other railway projects.
There were six billion euros in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it real 10 to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, funding will be missed for other nodes and narrow points in the network.
There are sixty major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers long route through the valley of Rhine.
Since 1987, it has been running at a slow pace.
You'd have to push it pretty hard.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The track through the Rhine Valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the airport judgment
The government of the country has been opened in the Wiesbaden Council if it goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice of Hessen (VGH) concerning the ban on night flights and allows it to be revised.
The CDU/FDP Coalition has mandated experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of the VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel said in writing that the state would have to re-adjust the night ban on flights in the case of construction of the planned north-west ranges of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the government expects, does not comply with the law ordered to protect the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it will require a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and came to the government’s representative to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD faction Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises about the ban on night flights she gave before the election.
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green Tarek Al-Wazir in a hint of the FDP election slogan - We hold the word -
Minister Posch has rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s statement, the government of the country is trying to get to its night flights through the “crucification of law and tricks.”
Accurate legal control needs its time.
The Coalition does not want to work on the basis of the \"quick first impression\"
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements of his faction to ban night flights have never been the same as those given by the opposition.
U.S. Banks Paying Aid
The U.S., crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America paid $45 billion (about €30 billion) on Wednesday.
According to a report by the U.S. state station CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
In this way, the constitutions want to get rid of the limitations that occurred by accepting money - limiting the payment of bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America acquired $19 billion of net money from investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
The rest of the money was taken from her cashier, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade unions.
Kenneth Lewis, head of the bank on Wednesday evening, expressly thanked the U.S. taxpayer: Money injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The Monetary Institute has damaged itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by also acquiring money on the capital market.
CNBC reported that the U.S. bank could report a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not want to say that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back.
Quick choice
It was just faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor only two weeks after ZDF’s board of directors pushed Nikolaus Brender out of office.
The Bureau wanted to agree on that person last night.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, the station did not confirm this - officially, so that the process did not take place.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm the intendent ZDF Markus Schächter if he did not pass the proposal to the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Bureau.
The result of the vote was unknown before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter and his proposal to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
There were only seven members voting for Brender, seven against him, and Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although he could be expected.
The EU’s majority on the board signaled several weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessen’s Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that Brender's surveillance quotas for ZDF's broadcasts had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was strongly criticised.
Last time, 35 state-owned lawyers were involved in the debate, who considered Koch’s procedure unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to the ‘heute-journalist’
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator-Morgenmagazines-; until 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; since then head of the main study of ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected journalist of the Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was set up, Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch’s anti-candidacy in the board of directors, Rhine-Faltic Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that federal countries should change the state contract with ZDF so that the personal proposals of the intensant could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, made a statement to the board of directors with a smart chess move - immediately after Brender's deployment, he criticized the Bureau for this.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to appoint him as editor-in-chief without losing his face, both Schächter, and he could be elected by the board of directors without becoming suspected of being pushed into office by the party.
In Party Arithmetics, Frey is thus ranked among left-wing liberals.
The study is getting rid of the harpmage.
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, the ministers of culture finally went to the federal countries on Thursday: At the conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that they would like to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: Basically, each study module should complete one single test.
In addition, the working load of the students should be checked, and a real and advocacy measure should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal Countries undertake to create a more flexible joint structural assignment for the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree fields.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors in the mouth have had winged words about better study.
They are now filled with specific content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation board has concluded that the number of tests will be partially reduced: ‘Each module will normally be completed only by one test,’ the 30-page report, which is intended to partially re-regulate the approval of study disciplines.
“A significantly lower test burden,” said Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, “is to stop a faulty development that significantly reduces the difficulty of study.”
To this end, the \"requirence of study\" - in the future - should be a decisive criterion - in the implementation.
Modules and content need to be checked hard so that they don’t necessarily limit students when they choose
the Seminary
Students should “require about the space that allows and supports their own initiative”
The rules are to apply when approving new study fields, after review but also for existing study fields.
You need to “reaccredit” every five years, however, which means that it will last until 2015, before all study fields will be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation councils established by the Federal States.
Culture ministers called on the federal states in October to act on agencies so that the filling of the curriculum was not too large and the trial regime was not strict.
In the various federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures with the local ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhine-Falco has promised additional means for further development of the Bologna Process.
In particular, universities should pay for consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
For this, countries and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a new law to Parliament.
Only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate the availability of the master.
By the end of next year, the difficulty of all study fields in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and opposition disputed the country’s study conditions.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of College Groups of Juso called for the development of education policies not to take place in the future - behind closed doors - of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest, after the strike, students should at least speak a word about it, as well as students as persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantels: “We need the experience of students,” she said at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK consulted on a joint reform report on Thursday.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow every graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to the construction master’s degree.
Second, the federal countries must ensure that for today’s generation of bachelor’s degree students there are plenty of places available tomorrow in the master’s degree fields with the best possible study conditions, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The federal countries must employ far more speakers.
However, the ministers of culture did not express their free access to the master’s programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control - there is an introductory line of one of the poems of the poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn-out language piece focuses on the experience of the arrival of one dissident who gained freedom, but also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one children’s book publishing house, and later moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, 1993 gave poetry at the legendary Goethe University of Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
He took care of a significant extra-literal upheaval last Tuesday at one seminar in Munich, where he was a German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of her security acts.
Söllner left a statement in which Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admitted to cooperation as a secret secretary of the Romanian Secret Service Secure.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the 1989 German Language Prize.
Attempts to recruit started inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I am, continued Söllner, “that is, someone who has not resisted enough attempts at intimidation by the Secure”
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize, Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is stunned by a case that marks the depths and shame of the political system, which is based on control and tipping.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
The secret agent Walter played some role in the Security acts, said Michael Markel after Söllner’s confession and referred to the positive influence of the secret agent Walter.
“He cut me off,” Markel said.
He has a moral duty to make this comment.
Söllner’s statement was in this form and before this audience was unexpected, but the absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Spicy Secure.
Touching, can be assumed, will speculate, and in some cases, perhaps even know which name is hidden behind the cover name of Sorin, Voice, and Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime, a very certain view of Stazi’s components is still very diffused by the manipulation of the remnants of the Secure control.
In recent years, systematic education has been degraded and restricted.
One of the anti-dumping authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act has since been in a rather lengthy manner.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of folders.
That the former members of the Secure still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, he had one interview in which one of the former CEOs of the Secure of Temesvár expressed his refusal to pay the award.
He was told that he was a psychiatrist, after all, he was questioned only once.
The condemnation of power here has been expressed completely indiscriminately in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the case of Söllner, as in the context of the silent crime, raises inevitable questions.
Why now? Who has been harmed? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves the expectation that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the anointing of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which last night accepted the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Saturated Deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed sales representative came from a cute Christmas party, at which he distributed the sports goods manufacturer sweets, when he entered the called Mercedes-class C, a new coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor bag.
A man with a markate plateau was allowed to drive around a foreign city for him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck was also a 55-year-old man.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow it will continue to work.
Or it'll just start.
The words of only three days of the engaged Swiss: “We have achieved the 8th final in the Champions League thanks to the win3:1 above Unirea Urzicen from Romania,” but we must not be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally hard fight against the downfall.
“An even more important task is to stand before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Canca on a regular league day.
And avoid re-obvious weaknesses after three fast goals of Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11.)
Drawing
The eight-finals Champions League (match 16/17. + 23./24 February/ retaliatory match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of Babbel’s successor will be preserved.
Not only in the supposed healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to deploy and enjoy the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths, and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explaining the soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not show any effectiveness for the operation of the therapist Babbel.
He hurried some magic, admitted Babbel’s supporter Jens Lehmann, “when a new impulse comes in football, things sometimes happen that you wouldn’t consider possible.”
And Sami Khedir, who, after many weeks of injury, became the best player on the field due to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected “phenomene” by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the work procedures of the new superior: “He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation -
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports chairman Horst Heldt warns
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after the defeat of 0:4 in Leverkusen, Khedir thought.
And the sports chairman Horst Heldt recalled that even though one goal was achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not behind the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months, was due to weekend events that relived in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
They are the decisions that others and not Jens, he replied to the hard criticism of Lehmann.
He gave the board a weak lead and decided to change the coach after the pressure of puberty fans.
Even that he was abolished his free day after the matches, he referred to Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
“Lehmann’s statements form pure egoism,” Heldt said, and announced consequences for goalkeepers.
Both 40-year-olds will have no joy in their lives.
In any case, they are in favour of one another, that without the work of a set coaching team it would not be possible to play a strong and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a “big share in success,” says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously, and the man agrees with the Igelite bag.
World Heavyweight Championship
Passionate Duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitali Klička.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainians defended their title in heavyweight by the boxing organization WBC.
The judge’s statement was unanimity.
Hamburg - Vitali Kličko remains the world champion in the heavyweight box.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klička, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to be the one everyone expected.
The button improved its balance to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th fight.
About 17,000 spectators in the Berlin arena were driven by a 2.02-metre-high Kličko duel mainly with his left hand.
An 11-centimetre smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Kličko’s era before the duel, pulled off in front of the world champion’s strike, so Kličko couldn’t set a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, he made a passive Johnson on the challenger a lot and tried to just get into the next round.
Although the click provoked words and gestures, his strikes were rarely hit by the master of the world.
But still, it's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Kliček full of twelve rounds.
Before the fight, the challenger took care of a stir in the Swiss capital.
He insulted the Klička as a “resistible zombie” that nothing can do properly.
During the weighing on Friday the champion was provoked, he pulled Johnson out of the nose of his sunglasses so he could see his eyes.
Fourth victory after Kliček's return
Kličko remained unbeatable after the fourth battle after her return on 11 October 2008.
After almost a four-year break, Samuel Peter defeated Nigeria in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to hand over without fighting.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in defense of the title.
In this fight, I got only one wound and physically I was in good shape, justifying Kličko's quick return to the ring.
His dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by British David Haye, after he settled down from the throne of 2.13 meters high Nikolai Vulayev in November.
Haye refused to fight against Kliček in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning a fight against Kličk at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Case of Kunduz
President of the Greens faction Jürgen Trittin called the Kunduz Minister of Defense a liar because of poor information on the issue.
SPD and Linke (Levice) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin: According to the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a conscious lie.
Minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said “knowingly the truth,” said Green Jürgen Trittin, head of the Greens faction in the ARD’Tagesschau news program on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual expression: He lied.
The killing order was issued while not respecting the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. airstrike, which was requested by the German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, killed or wounded up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
Greens, SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) Saturday to immediately comment before the Federal Council and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy for targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal House - and, if the Chancellors' Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleagues called on Green Renate Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm, a spokesman for the government, has definitely rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there was also a loud doubt about the Ministry's representation of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary-General Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely of the background of the attack on tanks.
It was officially said that they should deny NATO reports and silence the minister's sensitive details.
However, it was said from the area of the two top officials that they warned the Ministry of Defense of several reports, including a bilateral document of Colonel Klein's command and one report by the military police.
-Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung - reports that Wichert should have asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any reply.
The Ministry did not comment on the statements on Saturday and pointed out that this would be addressed in the Committee of the Federal Chamber of Inquiry, which will be set next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in an alert state and hear voices that others do not see and hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in a drug connection intertwine the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and imaginations.
But those who experience dream conditions in the wake, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, usually pay in the modern Western world for a fool or drug addict, or at least as a stranger.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in mentally ill or in drug connections.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, here and there will ensure that the boundaries between a dream, an idea, and a reality will flow.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in the better case we call them visions, in worse errors.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic state of blasphemy, psyche and hallucination can be derived from similar processes.
Halucinations or visions occur when the balance of neural transmitters of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misconceptions occur very often in schizophrenia.
Gravitation has no power over it.
The connection between the error and the dream employed philosophers and doctors since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucination as a form of dream in an awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 a great resemblance to the folly with dream conditions - for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even -psychosis, with all nonsense, overcrows, lying of senses -
Autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colored.
Gravitation over it has no power, rises at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with bloody red grips, valuing teeth.
They chase him, dig him with heavy, fire-bots, throw with him about the wall, feel pain throughout the body.
The loud, bad voices are threatening from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that they give him and insult him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from the stereo, plugs them into the loop and fixes it on the hook on the ceiling.
He rises to one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn, the voices of the choir are screaming, tearing his drums, “Go to the clinic and get treated.”
Today, Henningu T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychopaths, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizophrenia, and he is maniodepressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, three years married.
I've experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts in my psyche, he says.
Witches are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get sick at least once in the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenia, the disabled can no longer distinguish the inner and outer worlds, they get into a awakened state that can lead to hallucinations, grandeurs, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment, or conduct dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The affected person is not able to distinguish important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, the psyche of the building opens up the flood of thoughts and imaginations that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychology is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Clinic of General Psychiatry of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenik is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed towards it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparing with reality is not usually possible with them, ghosts are a terrible fact, awakening is excluded.
Experience hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, he says, “But the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that a person perceives in the psyche is essentially preserved.”
Foolish ideas and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place within a real framework.
Scientists are still facing a puzzle about why our brain is doing this kind of thing.
Exceptional states can lead each person to lose their relationship to reality for a short period of time.
But not everyone will develop into psychology.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development, the neural maturation of the brain, such as mother's viral disease during pregnancy, will be damaged.
But it remains a puzzle about how the neural system will break, which has not been shown in any way for many years.
Roles also play the influences of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of the psyche if it is available.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psoriasis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain closes
Crazy is that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and in order to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we see misconceptions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and overcrowdings for ten years, last year interpreting his results in the book “Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf” (Unreal world in our head).
Halucination is one of the typical accompanying phenomena of the psyche, but also one of the surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, he hallucinates under certain conditions even the brain itself of a healthy person.
Halucination, according to Casten, consists of the contents of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; if our brain is heated or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psyche.
But also removing incentives, stress, worries with love or other exceptional states.
In recent studies, one-third of those surveyed said they experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Premier Pomerania and attending a high school there.
In fact, a perfectly normal girl.
If there were not those pictures and voices.
Breaks can happen to her with long, dark hair.
When he answers, the classmates look at her with a surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This shy girl sees a captured dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees a girl sitting next to him on the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other misconceptions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting.
Often they are a burden.
As she sits in class, she can’t watch the lessons as many times as the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else the mathematical equation.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting.
When waiting in her dark room for a sleep that rarely comes and too late, she can often distinguish whether she is awake or if she is already asleep, whether the images she sees, grimas, or a girl with bleeding cutting wounds on her hands and legs arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, screaming at those characters.
Parents and friends don't say anything about it, they think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations were established.
Since being contacted by psychologist Casten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she has not gone crazy.
Mistakes are also the art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or is taken away from incentives, he will likely have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough jobs and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., the only one, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man her dad has been calling since she was thinking of herself is not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain regions that process real sensations and sounds are active, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish error and reality from each other.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to form, which is why it works so realistically -
Night dreams also evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucination in acute psyche.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their mistakes as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border status between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological in our world, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor of Heidelberg and Chief Medical Officer of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positiveness, creativity - the overcrowd is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid conditions are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams, which the affected person considers real and cannot even distinguish them backwards from the alert state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor disease in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and by himself, such as a lasting, total inability to move, he replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The kind of border state between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality there is no way of mastering a situation, there will be a change in worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of support for senses and the transfer of senses into some intolerable situation that enables people to have their own ability to form, to move into the loss of consciousness in a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories.
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book “Herzwechsel” (Herzwechsel) as a life-saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after the surgery of the heart valve with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness went on a few days’ journey, while his body lay motionlessly on the unit of intensive care.
Claussen dived into the world he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man caught in a bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot watches his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles, who manufactures drugs from the blood.
On a motorcycle, he takes the Greek to his homeland, surfs on a hospital bed at a company in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It is completely immersed in imaginary, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths for Claussen are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are still clearly clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show oneiroid states, psyche, hallucinations and drug connections, how fragile even in an alert state our inner images of external reality are.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, “may lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 they are to take over the publishing house of children
Kallen’s new publishing director is a transitional solution: He wants Hubert Burda to hand over his business to his two children for a long time, SPIEGEL said.
Holding will also belong to the family 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, says the 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We carefully addressed the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is considered only then.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to lead 7,500 employees of their children if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both children and businesses.
Burda announced Thursday that he was withdrawing from the board of directors since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member since 1999.
He was first in charge of technology.
Later, with the Cashier section, responsibility for the company’s assets was added and after the withdrawal of Jürgen Todenhöfera also Direct Marketing, Foreigner, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment is also used to “acclude 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
Holding should also be a 100 percent family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family businesses are not sure before the end: “It has always been touched by companies that have been infected with the desire for capital that have speculated and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had dreams of world power, says Burda.
I don’t see myself as a political proponent of this country, like Springer, and I don’t want to play the world league with ‘Time’, these trades are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you can wish for in the area of beauty and well-being, you have at your fingertips.
This was established by El Corte Ingles, which has just begun the operation of the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre with an area of more than 1000 m2, in which various services in the area of body care are provided.

Escotes variados
Christmas is approaching, and this is the time when it is advisable to find out what the celebrities wear, and adjust it to their solemn wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which must be noted.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'LIVE Chancellor'.
It is a project for the development and enforcement of an electric vehicle in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE Office will establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will provide mobility agreements, manage, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop ProjectMOVELE, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose is to support this transport medium of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project of the introduction of electric vehicles in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
It is three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the deployment of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support R&D activities in the Catalan Autonomous Area.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in terms of electric vehicle enforcement.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the 'clide period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a “room period”
In the 2009 economic report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summarized the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a competitive plan for the automotive sector, we would be facing a state of desertion today, the closure of some of our major manufacturing companies,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace of mind is expected in the future in this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrative Plan of the Automotive Industry (PIA), has set 800 million for 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised an investment exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government measures to support the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which applies in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan allowed the average emissions to be reduced by 6% for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a \"significant increase\" in entries, specifically in November by -40%.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Classic Vehicle Salon will be opened, a space for meetings between professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.

Mazda3 i-Stop: maintenance of sports style
Mazda intends to show that gentleness to the surrounding environment has no negative impact on the sporty style.
Therefore, Mazda3 also has a built-in stop and start system - also baptized as a-Stop-, a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent for Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely fine.
Using a set of tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in the development of a futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style, which also presents the Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the soberness of German products and, in particular, even more with Volkswagen Golf, who all want to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start system of the engine is available only with a petrol engine for two liters and 150 horsepower with a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very fine, characterized by reduced noise level, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not run so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
The RVM system, which prevents the formation of a dead angle, stroke and stability control, speed control, internal light-sensitive mirror, large-screen on-board computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels, must be mentioned in the series equipment.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with a Pack Premium, for an extra charge of EUR 1.500: adaptable lights of two-xenon and sound system of BOSE with CD holder, in addition to other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not run more miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 hp.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which amounts to 21.770 euros for Luxury and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great amount of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L. A. has a red carpet, fine as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the 'Nine' brand.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only used to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine appreciated him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by very low prices and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one is intended solely for Twitter, the other based on a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay for Peek six times the amount.
FonPeek, which was introduced yesterday at the event of Le Web, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as well as its American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is around 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea with a rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for a reduction in roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon, if it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and consider various offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering downloadable books and further searching on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid when purchased, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen once in the case ofFonPeek, it’s the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the U.S.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it’s the best type of consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The Color Michelle Loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama’s appearance as President of the United States, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color she also chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the transfer of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with shimmering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat from the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturiasian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of joining the function of Michelle, she used a large lace, in Oslo a Velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high heel, a now-similar model, but in a golden color.
He also wears different hairstyles: this time he smothered, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternity-related work problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger years who intend to acquire a child.
This is the result of the study 'Food and working career of Spanish women', carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study involved 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to motherhood.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of partner coexistence there are many differences in opinions on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, give birth to the first child, and have more children in total.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, delay partnership and motherhood, and have fewer descendants.
Women from 35 to 49 with a stable job have an average of 3.7 years since the start of coexistence with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted more of their lives to achieving their stable employment and therefore have to postpone their partner life and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on motherhood, although less influence on the time of coexistence with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is involved in research at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with primary education get married and give birth to the first child before they find a stable job, while women with middle or high education tend to prefer to get a stable job, rather than getting married and giving birth to the first child,” Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives, Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant international actresses, is thus joining the other famous personalities L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Lodge') entered this selected club.
The men's part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (the Evangelin Partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, both earlier and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicent 's
Manuel Vicent donates in 'Esová poker' (Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life).
It does not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but it seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent does not save relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the enjoyment of counter-judgment, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
The Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not his intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him.
About Graham Green: “Our man has been destined to this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and regret, which is a spiritual privilege to attain heaven by the way of damnation.”
James Joyce: 'This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall down.'
William Faulkner: “He was a weird man.
On his own, he said about himself that he was the heir of a countyowner, sometimes again that he was the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream.
About Louis-Ferinand Céline: “This writer captured this man from Munich on the bridge to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing himself and calling for the future and vigorously speaking to worms.”
About Dorothy Parker: “One of you was lying down and praying, ‘God my beloved, make sure that I stop writing like a woman,’” she said.
On Joseph Conrad: “On his grave, the Spenser’s verse was engraved: ‘After the effort came a dream,/ after the storm a quiet port,/after the war of rest,/after the full life of death’
Virginia Wolf: “He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII followed her among the azales or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly.
O Pio Baroja: “What else was going on to Martín Santos, except to focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else was it about Beneto than letting Baroja execute Faulkner's gun?
What else was the matter to Celebrate than to make himself famous at the expense of the glory of that man.
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother went through our neighborhood, Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed through the circle and our dog, a cross saved from a shelter of a maximum of six kilograms, without a single word, they kicked him twice and severely injured him.
Our indignation is greater than not seeing anything funny in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the lead.
And the old lady’s shock after this incident, when she met these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-obsessed man who invades an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint with the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt it was something, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
Indignation has made us communicate this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with today’s youth when they’re having fun with the defenseless animal that gives us love, society, and friendship.
We do not understand where proper education, respect for animals and humans went.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with Spain’s Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both of these entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, as it is the only means to avoid head injuries or death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their commitment to transport safety, which means “more than designing and producing even safer products,” and it has confirmed that it is trying to achieve this purpose differently, i.e. through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets while driving on a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first stage when more than 500 repair motorcycles will be deployed to reach the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety is a permanent problem, that company, which is the manufacturer of two-wheeled tyres and whose main goal is to continuously increase product safety.
Increased sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in November in Spain increased by 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, this was the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the figures of the national organisation of manufacturers Anfac and salesmen Ganvam.
However, the positive figure is better to put in quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/cars.
And the clouds that damage demand the most, even when bought by private individuals, did not disappear, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and almost 100% of them were financing through third parties.
Other factors such as stopping or continuing a bad economic situation should also be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of a bank credit source.
In a given situation, unlike passenger cars, support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention individuals who are engaged in the trade list of small and medium-sized companies who intend to buy a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam, they recalled the need to pay particular attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Association of Sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to sales calculations for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the manual brake is already mandatory equipment.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be done with ESP stability control, hand brake assistance systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, they already form part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others have a deadline for tackling the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures in place in the EU aim to increase pedestrian protection, which can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary system of the manual brake increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver goes down.
But it can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by Bosch auto parts manufacturers, a third of the drivers who had an accident did not hit the brake before the crash, and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 deaths per year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more striking-depending on calculations would avoid one of the four accidents affecting the person-after the introduction of so-called intelligent systems manual brakes.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as intensely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors delays Opel plan until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, an employee of Opel at Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will be launched in the first week of April - probably on April 8 - as Javier Ortega said, the American manufacturer notes that more time will be needed to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the countries in which the production facilities are based, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that Saab’s sales decision should be taken these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American producer to take certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but he is considering the possibility of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, who operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg group.
If it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to Baic Chinese.
The decision is still valid at the end of Saab if sales fail.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
When developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of this, the automatic downloading roof was in a handmade version, which reduced weight by 21 kg; further, aluminum doors such as GT3, which means an additional 15 kg less; air conditioning removal, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to the weight reduction by an additional 7 kg; after the installation of sports seats additional 12 kg, thanks to the lightweight 19-inch additional wheels of five kg.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a two-cylinder PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-ordered six-speed cabinet was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many interlocked corners.
His behaviour can only be qualified as inviolable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle does not print to asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary: we haven’t tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would also carry such safety when moving in a turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of heating muscles on a short drive for the necessary time until we order him sprinting, braking, and restoring the use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to a drive that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we suggest on the steering wheel, it's what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
The sound of the engine according to will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is a very good performance and can be strengthened by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifys the sound of the engine that was previously used with the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during sucking or recuperation.
The curtains are fixed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; while in some corners we encountered the dawn of frost and gravel even in the advanced morning.
Ultimately, this ultralight car is one of the funniest in the market, as it is a little more than just a Boxster S modification.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010 at a price of €70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, Coco Cocoon's icon and the casual 'starlette' at the corporate shows, the singer shows her face to a bad girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basques have awarded victory in Israel
The cashier won a brilliant victory in 82-91 while hosting at the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice cooperative, and thus she got to the forefront of her group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 reviews).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence ofHerrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic with a great amount of effort and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began with a blue face, which from the beginning stood on the brand.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alaskan team opted for Baraca's inner play and Eliyah's work, which was adopted by sanding and compressing when returning to its original scene to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already become the best in his team with 13 points, although without six’ in Splitter’s rating it has already suggested that it will not be the best evening for Brazil.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the smallest, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone was winning on their pitch, and 'with Elía' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the return of the ‘yellows’ to the highlands (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, wounded, but not dead at all, needed a few exact games to catch their breath, and then appeared the Mirz Teletovic machine, which three tripled almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaskans have already laid off their skin in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to lose their deserved results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Nevertheless, and with Splitter excluded from Faul seIvanovic they did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already had the winner andTel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leadership of Group B in Eurolize in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga Cooperative has not been affected by the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or the opponent, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, lit up the field with 12-18, a minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofUnicaja, although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcice and Schortsanis, rotated scores of 22-20, a minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between USBeverley and Williams resistance meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the absence of English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened Unicaja.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing, Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Unable to Retaliate
The third part was very offensive by Olympiacos, who, although losing at 19, proved to be an advantage and even managed to balance the difference from the match in Malaze Málaga 66-48, a minute 27 that shook the leaders in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of Scottish beer by Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja, thanks to the leadership and triple points of Cook and the contribution of Lewis, she left a certain hope of winning 66-57, a minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the strengthening and supremacy in centimeters in his zone, proved to be unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, was able to levelbasket average 81-62, a minute 37, and Unicaja pivoted and passed on to the leadership of Olympiacos.

According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paying.
The British programmer takes 45.226 euros gross per year and French 31.059 while Spain receives 24,000.
The driver also has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain, the highest paid job of a waiter with 11.592 euros net per year is followed by a seller with 14.725 euros and a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most sought-after job on the network in the last three months is a driver, a half-time job and a social worker.
Brazil sets Zelay's date of departure
The Brazilian government has set the deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Antiguacigalpa.
The established president must leave the diplomatic mission at the latest on 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Dutch capital, confirmed to TV Globo that \"Mel\" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21.
He is aware that on 27 January after the end of his mandate he must leave and seek another refuge.
The station also quoted a former stateman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the specified deadline: “I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the election on November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
The same week, however, he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually collapsed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum that the government-de-facto - chaired by Roberto Micheletti tried to impose on him.
Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented a prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty appeared again in the markets, which should not surprise, because it is already a natural state in an environment where the rulers take decisions about a future that is insecure in itself.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was to finance the debt by directly purchasing assets and indirectly releasing liquidity in a close-to- zero exchange rate so that financial institutions could buy assets for deduction.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended, and without questioning their indiscriminate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the auction, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and participate in the return of a reduction in risk returns.
The movement of the stock exchange and the differences of bonds by companies have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
It is again pushing on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a refuge chosen by investors, thus expanding the differentiation of euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Spanish Kingdom qualification reduction.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risk advocates, who have tried again to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to inhibit the devastating consequences of limiting their employment credit when, in fact, a new day of thanksgiving would have to be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen it before.
A government that hides deficits, elections, and a new government is on its way.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfillment of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the member countries of the euro not to fulfil their obligations.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin will force the Greek government to transparently and commit its own citizens to shared responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are located before the period of normalization of the transitional risk premium, after some excesses in the supported positions would be within the expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences are reduced and our differences continue to expand, this would typically be a Spanish risk.
The matter of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their scenario of ascension for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, this does not give the Spanish economy a great hope of living up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being - with caution, the driver's friend -

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene before the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by President Gas Natural-Fenosa’s speech, Rafael Villasce, Galán provided several comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommittee behind the closed door.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 million by 2020 and an additional 60,000 million by 2030, if nuclear power plants are currently in operation.
If this does not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
In fact, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the issue will change and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other \"supporting energies\"
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy law that has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the company has requested, did not want to let go of a living as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, a clear long-term bet - in this sense, despite \"accurate\" - is a measure, as Iberdrola called them.
Whatever it may be, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to be adopted now, because their maturity lasts and a stable tax framework is necessary to begin them.
Ferrovial wins ‘handling’ Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of Irish Airlines, Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet come into effect on economic terms, has been in force for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and Alcalá de Henares University signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create a Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which are Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be energy efficiency research at highways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it is already working as an energy and water company.
The construction is an estimated 1700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
The 5km long tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the east coast, became the closest option for the country to settle as a construction and concession highway company.
The City Hall wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After choosing public-private cooperation (PPP according to initials in English) for further development of the project in a business plan named Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Offers are expected to be submitted in May, and the expected investment is expected to reach $1,700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and three companies with significant presence in European buildings are expected to compete in the final stage.
The Transcity Group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, and the second is one of the largest European underground construction specialists.
Acciona is in the game with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which passed through the sieve, has the name LBRJV and is involved in Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialized in civil construction Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatizations, but brings with it a clear difficulty of entering in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has gained market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Million assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of enterprises that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground road tolled by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link, is to connect the Western Highway from Toolong with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of 5 kilometers of the tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce the traffic congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to enter for the summer 2010 and start work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned only for 2016.
The tunnel was launched in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $500 million of Australian dollars (€308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit, as it announced a contract with a government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
ACS will operate the national wide-band network infrastructure with optical fiber cable through its local Leighton branch.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet of 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project of the King George Tower on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction works were just about to start and Hochtief closed sales for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, the FCC has received an allocation of 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia worth 64.5 million euros.
The company acquired a contract several days after working on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The opening of the work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore won advertising in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra over the past two years. Rushmore for an approximate amount of €3 million per year, the railway company said.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented themselves in the competition published by Renfe, four of which went to the final, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating advertising in the last three years.
From this point on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of campaigns.
Punishment of 63 million for France to the Telecoms for discouraging competition
France’s competition regulator fined LFrance’s 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes with consumers at the edge of the regulation.
This sanction was a former French monopoly and still the state company has purchased more than €560 million of fines since 1994 for imposing obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the Office, which oversees competition, considers that France Tilecom has committed a similar offence as in the past, and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store to increase revenue that will not come from voice streams.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry to other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barçe
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition has divided EUR 5.362.5 million among 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in this event since the opening of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money it won for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won three main prizes.
The Catalan champion and the last winner of the 1992 European Cup is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two teams that also charged the most money for participating in the past Champions League.
Both lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to earn the most money through Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by a complex procedure in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the authority chaired by Michel Platini is planning to make 1.090 million for the Champions League.
UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (among other Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to an additional €550,000 for each match they participated in.
There is also a prize for winning (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 for each team). The Osmifinalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive 4 million.
The champion will earn 9 million, while the second finalist will earn 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will make a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
The champion from last year will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published the details of the offer to buy shares with which it wants to get the top spot between 25% to 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this delay1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at €1.85; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer evaluates the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling shares.
The CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, even though the company Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had merged with the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos was 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce changes the structure of its management.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial fluctuations of its former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, María Luisa Jorda was announced as head of internal audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to have a high role in the food business.
This is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the polemics, as the enterprise is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million of Sos by Salazar brothers.
De facto, the possibility that new fund transfers will be revealed in the coming months
As for the Salazar credit, former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega Council (CCM and Unicaja representatives) told the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing the place of destination.
CNMV allows the option to exclude Paterina, who participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised the exclusion of Inversora Mer’s participation in the Federico Paterninov on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it allows this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that it is ‘sufficiency’ to explain the booklets submitted after the modifications introduced on 2 December.
CNMV has stated that the offer is aimed at obtaining550.008 shares of Federica Paterina at a price of €7.65 per share, which represents 8.95% of the company’s capital, which consists of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares could not be transferred in any way until the tender was closed, which he specified that the price was set by Federice Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
In these days of storms and accidents, they not only earn car services.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance accident are drawn to service where the expert must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same, and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the labor force can be long and complex work.
Calculation of manual repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts, and the workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and solutions to estimate insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American Solera Group, is a leading company; 80% of the rating is made with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, business director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing is still increasing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been reported in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, the - intelligent - graphic processing - where possible - is carried out - individual parts of tourist cars.
When it comes to a model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
About the road park in circulation exceeds 99%.
To perform the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) working at the same time with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast flow of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses are focused on repair and maintenance, but according to countries there are also tools for the management of spare parts or for the calculation of the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide to informing about the value of vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard solution for the award of insurance events designed for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is valid according to the application for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it less than a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN enable the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, allowing vehicles to be discarded with overall insurance events.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the tendency, performing geodemographic analyses or finding deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have been serviced due to an accident or how much has suffered serious insurance events over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, Gt Estimate is sold, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution for the assessment of damage, accidents or maintenance of cars.
Gt Guía Valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and accounted for €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the internationalization process of the installation of the office in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global invoicing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make €19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera was on the $1,000 million stock exchange and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation expected an upsurge of €59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This pricing and purchase and sales service is only guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, service providers, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who have to register before the start of the operation.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisements and adds about 100 new ads every day to the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been decommissioned, after a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audetex guarantees that the user will get a budget in only four steps: vehicle identification, finding a spare part, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of senior professionals who are more or less dependent on the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, including 666, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model will appear, and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The User may include variables as the price of the labour force, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass on to the Customer.
AudaTaller is not an AudaPlus valuation tool, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, as it will allow, for example, to select the door and turn it around to display the inner side.
