Republican Party Strategy Against Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy of the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
However, the intervention center calls such a myth that electoral fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die from lightning.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 electoral fraud cases in the United States in the last 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that make the process of voting or enrolling in the electoral list more difficult.
After the November 2010 elections, 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states took part in this phenomenon.
As a result, 180 proposals for laws restricting electoral law were submitted in 41 countries only in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the electoral period in advance, invalidate the right to enroll in the electoral list on the day of the election and withdraw the electoral right of citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required the voters to present an identity card with photographs.
The first country to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age who are allowed to vote, do not own a photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
It also has no such ID card of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, getting a required ID card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minority members and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of those with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29, therefore, do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who as voters are known for their inclination to democratic candidates are not entitled to use their ID card with photographs exposed to their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer Republican candidates to use cards issued by these clubs during the elections.
By 2004, no state had required evidence of citizenship at the election.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
In 2011, the Republican legislators supported laws in eight states that abolish voter registration on the day of the election.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist voters who wish to enroll.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004 campaign for voter registration helped about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 resulted in a 17% decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in five more states aimed at shortening the term for elections in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American voters in the country.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the people who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have stood very strongly against the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several draft laws by their veto.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, even the U.S. Attorney General hit.
They partially managed to reduce the damage.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID were only adopted by 16 of the 34 states.
The new rules, however, will undoubtedly make voting rights more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the bias of the approved laws and consider them a clear effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 report by the Centre of the University of California shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 out of 270 votes in the electorate's body necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test yielded bad results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this increased the hesitantness of men who were already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a high degree of contamination among individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate between patients who underwent examinations and those who did not go to them.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who did not go to the examination had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend testing from 50 years of age or 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
The men of African American origin are also more threatened by the group.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and types of cancer that are insignificant.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treating prostate cancer, which does not affect life in the long term, and to focus on active supervision of the disease in these cases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest that they perform active supervision, and in the case of progression of the disease, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often and with greater precision, we set criteria that help in deciding which kind to treat and which not.
However, I recommend doing the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, Movember has created a tool that enables evaluation for and against PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, it seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease by adopting healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy meals and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of the disease causes heredity.
Some percentages also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Society for Cancer Research, the fight against smoking remains a priority, although the number of smokers decreases.
Cigars are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
“There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” spokesperson André Beaulieu said.
10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer death decreases by half.
Weight
Body and obesity, according to the SCC, are another risk factor for the occurrence of diseases.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreatics and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report said.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends reducing red meat consumption.
With excessive consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid the fruit for which the same applies.
The preservation of meat by contaminating, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” the report added.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet come to clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC.
Although one of them says there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, other studies are talking more about increasing it.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about his concerns and precedents from the family with his doctor.
To undergo an examination does not mean that you will have cancer.
Higgs boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson sparked a legitimate upheaval last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it is also the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or - least bad - an explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no 100% certainty among physics that it is a Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Kyoto great physical congress confirms it, but there are still no data available to be absolutely secure.
However, suppose it's a Higgs boson, because the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what it's about.
There is a perfectly unquestioned law in this world, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard to do it, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that there is a similar law in it: Pauli’s exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quant state” - this “state” - roughly to put it creates some of their characteristics.
It also divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermiones, who obey Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end there are bosons, according to anarchists who do not appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (although absolutely amazing), which is The Partial Adventure, in Berkeley's labs: mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and 'strength particles' with which the great natural forces spread, and with which Higgs' boson is probably somehow associated.
However, it is necessary to say that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or a “particle of light” that is the “carrier” of electromagnetic forces.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into the pond, will be interrupted.
From this “disruption”, an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the bosons, -the carriers of force -
More Stable Field
It’s also the case with Higgs’ boson, just with the difference of “interrupting”, another field is needed, Higgs’ field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; its excitement must be achieved by very high energy values, similar to that of the frozen level of the pond, which is already depleted by a lot of large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of parts as a accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with friendly volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The electromagnetic field analogy is again suitable for clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With an electromagnetic field, neither all the particles nor all the materials react.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on the refrigerator.
Similarly, with the Higgs field they don’t react to all the particles: those that they do have a certain mass, while others (such as photon, let’s look at it) don’t have it.
And Mrs. Nováková asks what all these researches are for, what they’re going to bring to us.
In terms of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to undergo examination of any non-compliance between the observations and the forecasts of the SM.
In addition, no physicists have literally wanted them to be found, because the slightest difference could open up space - new physics - and cover some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to state that the model has so far huge shortcomings, it does not bring any clarification of gravity (south!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the cosmic matter (south!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Responses
The responses of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Novak can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell's laboratories had no idea of the revolution that would trigger their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a \"toy to the lab\" -
Just imagine...
In addition, it can also result from all the tools surrounding the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optics-focused work.
This sensor, although Boyle initially didn’t plan to do it at all, now serves as a “eye” of all digital cameras in the world and has won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around LHC must necessarily change our lives, but that one does not really know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission on Decent Dying, Quebec has recently been involved in a delicate end-of-life question.
The debate should be continued soon and at the same time the bill is about to be proposed.
A lot of work remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérieg.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
“They gave me five years of life, and it’s already seven,” he says without emotion on his bed in the palliative care house of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
“It’s still a shock, you can’t prepare for this,” he adds.
The disease performed its work: the immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks at the delicious-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop at him, bringing him medicine, offering a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me,” he said.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“Throughout life, one learns that men urinate vests,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the child’s stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the abilities of the person who receives the return,” says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, the crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients entering the home with palliative care of Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide so-called \"healing\" care.
In the case of Mrs. A, 89 years old, it is the worst concern to die of suffocation in full consciousness.
The disease allowed me to discover my children.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I don’t have a wish in my life,” she says, and then lets us put on a breathing device.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care for the body with the help of nutrition is provided.
This is what palliative care looks like, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek there is one bed of palliative care per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, one can give him, for example, a piece of brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, they carried Mr. X's beer, which died later that night.
This morning, his son drinks beer in honor of his late father.
“We help patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
In Victor-Gadbois's home, they go one another's days, but they don't look like each other.
In addition to a thirty-nine-year-old man who rejoices in his last meeting with his family carefully based on pillows, while drinking in his honor, a tragically sixty-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, a woman and two young children, dies after trying all the possibilities to survive.
“For half a year, there are always three to five beds that are intended for people with cancer under 45 years of age,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois’ home come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is designed to relieve suffering once the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing house.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal Area, specialize more and less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental inaccessibility of healthcare in Quebec that leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of the euthanasia law and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by leaders in palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they show their dissent to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, thequebet health system is not powerful enough to provide all people with access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
She said she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on standby in huge pains without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is afraid that patients will not ask for death because they do not receive appropriate care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists take care of their patients until the last minute, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
The hopes of survival were already minimal when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I was out of treatment, she replied that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who want to die thank their nursing physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative bitch team eased their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which will succeed the patient until the moment of the rock, whether impact or whether the sedation is permanently administered to him.
It cannot be said that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not going to get rid of pain will have more and more access to palliative sedations.
Illnesses who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: ‘I want to die’
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, ‘I want you to provide me with euthanasia,’ it means rather, ‘I want you to get rid of me of pain’.
The implementation of this report enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and experts at the Italian Mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are mixed.
This “defence” has come very expensive between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has broken up since we took major measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, former head of police in Montreal.
In 2011, the scandal broke out on the basis of a thorough investigation into the upheaval of funds in connection with the contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which then liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
“Duchesneau’s report has confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque funding of parties and corruption of civil servants.
“As early as the beginning of the investigation in 2010,” he says, “it was only the Ministry of Transport that saved billions of dollars on contracts, when some people kept their instincts in check to get a share of them!
Charbonneau's commission - has already led two mayors to the resignation, - he adds with the hope that she will be able to cover up the lucidity of some people -
Permanent unit to fight corruption founded in 2011
A permanent unit to fight corruption established in 2011 is also involved in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, police officers - Marteau's types - who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal-Cartel of money pipelines - will significantly reduce the inflatability of orders...
In recent weeks, they conducted a number of searches and accused of fraud and corruption by a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one suburban village.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third largestquebian city.
He is suspected to have repeatedly received bribery in exchange for public contracts.
Official charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
Lino Zambito provoked sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism - the system - the procurement of public contracts.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of orders he received in Montréal during these years to the middleman associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
After 2000, Zambia was generous on all sides and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to the provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he organized an illegal search for funds for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Exclusions with money pipelines whose prices have been overstretched
In Montreal, there was a “system” of corruption.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in a very detailed way before the commission: within ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocketes worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with cash pipelines, at which he oversaw the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had paid rewards for 30% to 40% overestimating invoices through false multi-workes.
The mayor of the mayor’s party Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of putting his eyes on the current budget, which brought dirty money to his cashier.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, putting Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Praires district in the east of the island, since 2010, he has been committed to selling municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a booming real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that “he is pulling behind the threads in an attempt to understand the functioning of the sea ant system to stop the gangrene and catch the vineyards.”
The process is painful, but positive.
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montréal and ensure supervision so that these dubious practices cannot be returned.
Like when they clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the roles of “reputed MPs” if they have not soaked into these chakras!
He estimates that 70% of Québek’s campaign funding comes from dirty money, and he adds with irony: ‘I heard it’s just a weak decoction of reality.
The Quebian government is proposing to limit the donations to 100 dollars, but that will not solve the situation: “Until the election expenses are strictly reduced, the dirty money from politics will not disappear.”
It proposes a comprehensive control of the procurement and financing system of the parties: ‘We can no longer fall below; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can build again on a firmer foundation and with greater control and compliance with the laws.’
If this story has blackened the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who mocks him to look at their own yard.
“PSG is not FC Barcelona”
This season, you and PSG set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other or a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players came to us.
Every day I get there next to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in matches.
Everything goes very fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the INF preparation Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on to individual degrees.
So you are using the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The strengths of this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And from this it follows that the player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
And in addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right moment?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
Today, he is not equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience with top teams and has won a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust they give me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead position.
We remain in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have progressed very easily to the 8th final.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for high-quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first so that we can play in the 8th round at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order to become a large European club, Paris must win titles and enroll in history.
That's not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this intention possible.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win a league title.
We missed out on last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had a chance to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it's going to work this year.
Although large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also seeking the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think PSG media expects too much?
It’s not unusual to expect a lot from us because of what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that when we beat Troys 4:0 at home and there's still something they blame us in the newspaper, it's not so pleasant.
People ask what people want more from you.
Of course, it’s not possible to win 4:0 at every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
At the Champions' League, we proved that we could play.
Take a look at Manchester City, which was no longer in the 8th season, and they also invested large amounts!
Given the amounts invested, you could expect to have a lead in front of the other 15 points!
This insults other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which were not very successful last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how awesome the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
PSG seems to rely on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovich in everything.
It is good to say that there is “dependence on Zlatan”
This means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and that he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a 1st league star.
Wherever he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I've experienced it, and I've come out stronger.
Today I am also playing good games.
And I've been hoping for that since I joined the team.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves so that our performance may be exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
He speaks for the results.
We are in a good place in the MS qualification.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and is able to inspire them to win.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved our goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid starting match?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I did not experience such a match for my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secured conversion protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
With 15,000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The Bitcoin course first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to 2 dollars, today it moves on the border of about 10 dollars (the course overview is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is not impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to “the most successful virtual money,” “competing the dollar and the euro,” and “a period of ordinary money.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being like “credits” used for the procedure in a video game that a person acquires by game or which he can buy (and rarely exchange back).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are depositors of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in fact between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the eligibility of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of common accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving the mathematical task given to computers, whose solution, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the cutting phase of the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers - take over - this new transaction and add a number to it, only then a whole - they split -
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (at least zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction then appears indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of both transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different print.
A computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is distributed on a regular basis by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided into one hundred million, so the margin space here is...
The difficulty of a given task also increases with a growing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and falls.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the stored bitcoin has been stolen.
“The problem used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls money laundering capabilities thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Significant players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not.
In November, huge discounts were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to convert bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to tell the address that can be photographed and identified by phone,” explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
“Before Bitcoin runs out, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive,” he says.
In addition, in its report, the ECB assumes a re-assessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not to wait for everything from us.
The greatest damage was suffered by people in the Afghan countryside that we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have lost 88 killed soldiers, and all those wounds and mutilations.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often rurales who refuse the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekistan, Tajiks joined them.
They now experience tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted by almonds thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacking a helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable practice between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the struggles between the various resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, which was completely controlled by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
Some Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an attempt to keep women in a subordinate position.
The chief officers of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became merchants, seized state property that they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They have discredited themselves; most of them have never even been in battle.
According to what I heard in the campaigns, people long for a government that will not be made up of thieves.
A number of young people want to leave as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity go away: capital escape is significant.
The young are tired of war and associated ideology.
During exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they knew the modern world, and its advantages captured them.
About 65% of the population is under 25; in Kabul there are currently 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full, there are girls and boys.
These young people will need to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish series that show the modern world, watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in her leadership be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralization after the pattern of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state of strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, should be abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been restored, no dam does not work, no essential irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
A private initiative is preferred.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There are reports that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And that just made it feel like the Western states were just here to take hold of it.
Without energy for processing iron ore or copper in place and without means of transporting raw materials over the mountains, however, no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the mine on Mes Aynak copper and left the opportunity for international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist area to retain the role of the most important employer in the whole province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys lycea, the French cathedral at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, there has been an initiative to “get the heart and soul” trying to align the aid and military activities, in which the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) service was cancelled in 2012, but thanks to the innumerable French non-governmental organisation of a series of successes in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which involved many local workers, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of an harvestable area.
What kind of memory will we leave after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude of over 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the insurrections led by foreign groups, they wish, in their words, to achieve little civil aid in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touched directly.
Difficult work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi went into another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the declaration of a constitution that gives it unlimited powers, he decided to play a vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the constitutional stability of the country and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative only further strengthened the country’s fragmentation.
In the view of the opposition, the president persists in his “autocracy delirium”, continuing to “disrupt his word”, and “scraping the law”
However, his supporters assure that this is a means of turning as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rejects protests.
In an interview with American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to believe that the Egyptians will vote for it.
Especially because this quick-organized vote puts the Egyptian people in front of the ultimatum: ‘You will either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers - which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 Members of the aforementioned constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the Constitution was announced, the door was banged with the fact that they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their move.
In order to achieve its capacity, 11 alternates were quickly supplemented last morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further abstained from the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text that was voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and provides that ‘the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law’.
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term ‘principles’ with the term ‘rule’, which would allow for more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
“Physicalism,” said the liberals, who see only a speech problem.
They believe that the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar to the University an advisory role, in particular for matters of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt’s expert Sophie Pommier, it’s disturbing because “persons called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The beginnings of theocracy can be seen.
The concerns of liberals are even more astounding the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the existing one.
“For now, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamic, but university workers, many of them have studied in French schools, - the mild concern of Alexis Bluet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that “there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to ‘fiqh’ [Islamic Legal Science].
And in the future, the question may arise, to what extent civil judges are competent, so that they can express themselves -
The text approved yesterday, in addition to religious pages, is highly criticised because of the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there was a significant restriction on the former regime.
Another disputed place: powers conferred on the army.
In line with the wishes of military officials, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
In addition, civil rights courts will not be banned, as the Human Rights Association has called for.
This association speaks in connection with the text which they believe is directed against freedom, about its doubts.
The offence of blasphemy is preserved and insults are still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to appear on TV last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, a bud of the world and a sea of saturated salt are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and nature’s inviolability.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To worship holy places
Visit the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all those who enter this ‘glory’ will descend from God’s mercy.
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine into a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The faithful will walk through the Path of Pain, or the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the court was held, walking through the streets of the Old Town and leading to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of Crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian bud of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which they made the cross for the Crucifixion of Jesus was grown.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the wall of cries, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which will then be fulfilled.
Take the road to the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from secret hiding from the enemy Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in climbing can get to it with their own strength.
The rest of them will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a well-known ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
This ski paradise is served by a shuttle bus from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, the pagan gods were reportedly living on top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judish Desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition, Impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which visitors present several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with manikins of users of spas and spa nurses from that time.
The Caesarea is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance fee is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
The fifth museum, the Museum of the Holocaust, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter - and you will find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are shimmering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perish.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it can be bathed even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the most strange sea in the world, located at the lowest mainland point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps both the surface and the person who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment with salt water - salt, and healing mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchial inflammation, diabetes to heal your nerves.
Touch the Mysterious Old Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them, the famous naval route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia went through.
The mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists truly love the toulogues with the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press yourself to the walls in the aisle of “your” sign, happiness will be favorably inclined to you.
In Jaffa you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to let themselves be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and \"getting\" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate of Pontius.
The carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, by word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speaks in this country.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is mainly by buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram and in the city of Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the top.
It is basically an underground cableway.
Travelling all kinds of public transport is worth 6 shekels, for which you can take 1.5 hours with the transfer.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it stops working in markets, shops and public transport.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will get only a kosher of food: except for pork, seafood, fish without shells and dishes, in which the combinations of milk and meat are contained.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls from ground foreigners - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israel.
However, there are very many fed cats that graze to their taste.
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats love populated places, and with taste they go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To recognize the country and rest came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, the country visited 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
The Great and the Powerful will announce this to Moscow: Emigrants will save money on the tongue
While MEPs and human rights defenders are still discussing the law on mandatory language trials, fraudsters have already appeared in the country who sell “foreigners” certificates
13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force under which every migrant worker will be required to pass an examination of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors over time.
However, the exams will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not subject to even people who have successfully achieved a certificate and obtained an academic diploma into the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship among Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass exams in all cities; today more than 160 such centers are opened in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask many times in the press the question: What will it really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So, above all, they correspond to representatives of the migration service - this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer from 'slave labour' -
Many people speak today about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the board of directors of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only the system of organised recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in immigrants without occupation, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of language, he says, with the conviction of Sebelev, a future migrant is sentenced to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a “notice” to the terrible, tight accommodations in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will spend months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
“In their country, they promise one thing, but when they arrive they will cheat, they will entertain their passports, they will not pay the promised wages,” says Chief Tajik Labour Migration Officer Tolib Sharipov.
Don't make it!
Less so, many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for their work recognize that they do not know not only the language of the country they want to go to, but they do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, this is not their fault, as rather the unhappiness: only very few Turkmenistans, Uzbekistans, Tajiks can afford to obtain at least a reasonable basic education.
For their families also need to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, married and equipped for school.
As children reach a productive age, they have to go to work at first opportunity.
Without knowledge of language, it is difficult - they admit.
You feel humiliated and inferior.
It is true that, having regard to the Law on Language Tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who have a legal status.
If they do not have it, they will neither pass the exams nor get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live as much as they did in Russia illegally.
Welcome, or Unappointed Entrance -
Many of the incoming workers say it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officials know that we have essentially false documents, without registration, and there are extortion cases.
“They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,” he shared with journalists about his experience as a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
“Don’t be shy, buy a painting.”
On the first day of validity of the Law of Language, it was found that false documents of migrants are not only the documents of registration.
FMS staff have already seized several false certificates of passing a language exam.
Falsified documents are printed on ordinary color printers.
Of course, they did not reach the new owners for free: each of the migrants in the hope of making it easier to pass the tests, paid for this document 7,000 rubles.
This is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, which is what government officials and human rights defenders agree to.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time, the time it takes to complete the course of the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russians are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) is not taking the illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia presents a proposal to tighten the law in relation to owners of civil weapons.
It is a response by government authorities to recent events: the shootings at weddings that have been done without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow’s lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, whose result was the death of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a gun license can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the Weapons Act would be presented to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the way-tightening of screws -
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the \"unsenseful reinforcement\" of the law.
The percentage of chuliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, in six months 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that toughening the legislation in the field of civil weapons will not cause the perpetrators to switch to the “black” market.
According to them, it is currently possible to find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Interior Ministry claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from race to officers
Black - The arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the Department of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot sites that accept weapons orders
The first of them - an armament or military journey - means a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the caucasians themselves,” says the Lamb.
Another type of \"black weapons\" is weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that the thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies are also included.
Illegal - mainly - are sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses there are often explosions.
“It has been shown that some fires have been deliberately established to cover up the manka,” said the former soldier.
According to the words of the Barance and the weapons manufacturers, their contribution is delivered.
“At present, private arms companies are forming that are not competitive in the international market and are decommissioning weapons that supply black markets, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of “black” is trafficking.
Especially large numbers of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and there is a mafia that organized their smooth production,” the former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate proportion of individual sources of supply of illicit weapons to the ‘black’ market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists discussed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all the weapons found themselves in the black market - the fault of official officials whose work is related to weapons,\" the report says.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of weapons were stolen in their production, 5% are black archaeology.
The dealer-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to give his name, is convinced that the weapons found in excavations by black archaeologists - no longer buys - are just too old.
Most often, he says, sellers are driving for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
In spite of the opponent, the interested party will buy a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he will sell it to you over the fence.
“He will take her to the city and sell her for 900 euros for a piece with two trays,” she says.
“The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and so whenever they start burning a plan in the clarity of crimes, they will carry out a control purchase with traders with illegal weapons,” he adds.
As in the luxury store.
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the “Expert Service” platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to the “nook” where we will work together.
The prize was mainly learned there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, tells the seller - an advisor. - I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically - from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to fix the daughter's tooth -
And now I'm going to get through the man I'm sure of.
He will only give it to me, because he knows that I will not give it.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he processed to become a publication on the subject.
The scheme did not change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album where he was, \"everything you thought,\"
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the soldier said.
The buyer, according to the words of the Lamb, does not offer hare in the bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller in the woods and we build a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I convince myself that the gun is shooting well, we are starting to act,” the expert explains.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to websites and groups on the “Vkontaktukt” - where weapons are offered to buy - for various purposes -
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
It is enough to have a fixed amount of money, - they write in the ad headline on the website - Buy a fighting gun or a slot machine -
On this site, users leave their notices and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
-Of course, without a license, - asks the user -Ivan - (the spelling is preserved).
Buying TT.Moscow - briefly formulates the requirement -Fedorenko -
A federal security service has recently thrown out a huge network of embedded websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can dig into the blade.
People are cooking like hungry fish for bait and then conquering coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military officer Viktor Baranec
I have heard about such schemes:webpages are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
In response to this, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden,” press spokesman Dmitry Kislov says.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay without a weapon and find yourself behind bars.

Macars for $100
When buying illegal firearms, you will usually pay between $100 and $900, according to experts.
According to Dmitry Kislov, from the non-governmental organization “Right to arms”, you’ll get a Macarov gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon is shipped from warehouses to long-term storage through medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official statistical authority, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% and was 22,9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
Working at McDonald, a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets has risen in America and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as “McDonald”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy’s”, and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of the ninth, or whether it is judged to disappear soon.
The whole event is supported by unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in modest salaries received by senior workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, protest organizers aim to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually intact by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “black Friday”, when the orgy hit America with cheap sales, captivated millions of people, and in some cases it was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, working for 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational chain companies whose goods are intended for people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, products in its stores are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only buy at work.
The availability and assortment of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods so cheaply because only little is paid by its employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic carts or manual scanners.
Demonstrators on the Black Friday demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the health insurance costs provided by companies increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee receives $9.5 per hour, but this does not correspond to the amount of spending, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, the company will cost $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the consumer’s shoulders, every visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and society should not cause any damage.
Black Friday - The company's stores lasted from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, her cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a representative of the company, said in an interview with the Huffington Post, that the jobs had left a total of less than five Walmart employees, and that the protest was all - another media sensation - organized by the unions.
The Unoccupied Treasury
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart stores (they in that progressive city are not very popular and therefore almost not here), but “McDonald” and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and doesn't pay you properly for your honest job!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work is in accordance with federal law and New York state regulations of $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their ranks of workers in New York are receiving $8.90 per hour.
No one in this expensive city has a lower wage.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
By employing at McDonald, nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers work on a part-time basis after school and live with their parents.
Few people see their main source of living or plan to stay there for too long.
At present, I constantly meet in an interview with workers - McDonald - who complain that they must live out of this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal, there is a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protesters, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalda on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashier and chefs in fast food companies start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists by bullying and releasing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food companies for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, loud protests were held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was at the McDonald Assembly, near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, said: “McDonald,” says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn’t even pay you sick and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work.
Demonstrators have also been supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of Billa de Blasio, who said: “We must work together to support fast-food workers to achieve fair rewards for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described in the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, although by far not all of them were fast food workers who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that will spark the flame of the mass movement is unclear so far.
So far, the brain has been lying on average.
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular theme of augmented reality; recently it means to perceive the world especially through the prisms of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also filed an application for the relevant patent.
An interview with a leading group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that glasses are already the past for scientists of this company.
It attracts the perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in a framework, what does your research group do?
- We deal with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has been stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, most often touching the screen with a fingertips.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect pickups - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all there is a very interesting option to control using gestures.
- What else awaits us in the future?
Despite the fact that the Kinect system transferred the interaction to a physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly improved.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects in a much more appropriate form to the real world.
And first of all, to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
This is a popular thing, but not overestimated?
- Certainly it cannot be considered a cure - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others about our activities and intentions in our area.
In fact, all types of computer interactions are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not the inflatable ones, just such scorny, short ones.
A gesture would not be taken with a camera device, but with a bracelet that would track the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of bracelet watches.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + a voice.
- How's that?
- How, for example, do you ask me to give you this soda can?
You'll say it, and you'll show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very complicated to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's mutual convergence.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, that provide quite good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn’t there enough resolution, depth, or anything else?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels, it's like matrix and depth.
At the same time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolutions in X and Y axes, but also Z.
So it is also very important to speed, the number of shots per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are honestly a little little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of a man with a machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just do not need so many touches, but I need some pictures in a second extra.
- And an increase in the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In Kinect, three cameras are now being used - one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And already a third camera - this is actually a common sensor of visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem.
Or worsen it because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations performed.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with curvature of camera placement and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don’t you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly keeping your smartphone in raised hands is not very convenient, but I think: the strongest option would be - portable - a form of real-life expansion, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones at any time, a projection display and more around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which there is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
Imagine, for a moment, that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands can't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the other hand as a certain type of background for imaging.
Excellent way to record the press!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactability to these - images in the air - for example, the interference of several direction ultrasonic rays at the defined point where the finger is located, creates a tactile feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you're blowing on your fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist, which affects the nerve ending in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person physically located in a very tight space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we also work on the concept of cross-country tracks (in general, not such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain lying becomes a goal, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in complete origins.
Vkusovski instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” is a continuation of the project “The St. Petersburg Avant-garde”, dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are the vanguard of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements exceed the framework of the city, often find recognition in Europe without reaching all-Russian fame.
The new hero, Rosbalt, is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and on vernisages.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are displayed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg Avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of citizens, increasing all mood.
Recently, he took the bottle and became a petrohradian bottletist because he matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you going all over town in red, not yellow, or turquoise?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, imagemaker and the public.
Although generally it is true that everything that is slightly different from gray awakens aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making an interview.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understood what my path was.
At that time, a wave of old free unofficial artists and a new, free type of artists went through I could not understand.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonevsky, who brought us to ‘Pushkinské 10’ and other waves were not.
I love theatrical, clothing, music, all genres except words.
- And all this merged in your art-clinic... - For me, it was important to be at the center of Petěrburk culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a place at Pushkinská 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of the peterburg bohemian god there before the reconstruction.
There was born many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how the Snura brought with the project -Ucho Van Gogha -
Snur and his friends sang light songs under a slide, dressed in an adjacent leotard, among them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training gained from us.
Gallery -D 137 - club -Griboboedov - this is the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and permanent guests left.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture was something else.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press, a special prize was \"People in our city\"
In the nomination “The Artist of the Year”, I was appointed, which ended my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In current years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the currentity and permeability are alive.
I will have a program exhibition - Russian Museum in clowns -
Clowns are timeless categories.
I used to be social, being so painful and terrible today.
But in clowns everything is going down, tragics are taking place.
I love grotesques, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of totalitarian disguise in the Order of Order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, orient themselves to external mechanics, not to the inner man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and he needs to swim in his face.
And the lie will be removed by changing.
- We've recently seen you in the role of a city bottler. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be it if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are falling apart.
Previously, people met in the noises, the godmother loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken into microcompanies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators will come to Stasu Mikhailov!
- Fans come to him, there's a sexual social sphere involved.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything will go wrong.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will deceive them and break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted such images that one collector was hanging on the wall together with Falk and Larion.
I started with images that people usually end up with.
People often confuse concepts today.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that’s different.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money because of drawing paintings.
And I am for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's the problem in Petěrburk?
- Good experts in culture.
There is such a concept: an actor through culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
During the times of the proper tsars it was not so in everything, the tsars may not have understood the culture too much, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
With us in St. Petersburg we have people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because there is a need for great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, the tasteful is prospering.
The same Erart, but they differ in the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petěrburk is?
- Petěrburk - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right land.
And on our eel, art succeeds in poverty.
We need cultural land, but today there are more writers than readers, that's wrong.
There are many people in Europe who are curious who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
There's only a weak layer of this in our country.
We need art to become a fashion business, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St. Peterburk grant
To give birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killing asteroid.
The caravans of space-carabs with landers on board go on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in conditions of effortlessness or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ).
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus they reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live there at a great height or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists with flora began to solve the questions of reproduction in space.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of pea grown on orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
It was then carried out by insects in orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a state of weightlessness.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem arises with the fact that this bird must find support, must stand on its own feet and begin to move,” says RAN Vladimir Syčev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP).
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make the cotrmels.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds lost instincts.
The birds did not react to light or sound.
And the difficulty was that they simply died within four days.
“Two times we let the birds hatch, but then we refused it, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, an experiment failure with chickens in the universe.
The last miniarch, the animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
In Biosatelite, Bion, there will be only one sex.
There was an experiment with rats who were already pregnant with space broadcasting.
They basically didn’t discover anything supernatural.
“It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on earth with space rats, offspring were born.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough task.
Animals, in the loss of their normal environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans can.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tereskovs.
The most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our Chaika flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would last for a flight to space.
She can give birth to a child after such a flight.
“No one has answered this question yet,” said Vachtang Vačnadze, a Space Shuttle veteran.
In June 1964, more than a year after her flight to space, she gave birth to Valentina Tereškova’s first woman-cosmonaut.
The father of the child was also astronaut Andrijan Nikolaiev.
In 1988, the son of a second woman-cosmonaut, Svetlana Savický, was born, who visited orbit twice, and who also worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have few cosmonauts who have been born after many years and are growing to the health of their descendants.
“It can also be dangerous in orbital years,” says astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts adopt the habits necessary to work in the open universe.
Water mimics the state of effortlessness.
Although water for adults is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, it is a natural element for young children.
Little ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is located on average 9 months in the mother’s fetal water and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks will pass.
“It’s very little to forget something,” said Marina Aksenova, an instructor for swimming newborns.
In short - if the condition of weightlessness is more natural for the newborn baby, then for women, the more natural is the necessary gravity, the attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness, there is a very rapid loss of abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvic pan, the ability of the body to proliferate the fetus.
We can leave it aside if muscle stimulators work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber, in which the mother's organism will drain the fetus.
What’s more, Valerij Poljakov asks complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If Earth’s attraction does not affect the body, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or the system of muscles.
A newborn on the orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
“If we go with you to an experiment that admits the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring on Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment,” says IBMP’s Chief Bioethics Committee, RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, the time will come when the earth will be a reality, and when the earth will set out in its arks on a far-off planet, which will become the home of their descendants born in space.
Head of the NCU: Control of the Squarx failed by the fault of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and high-quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but it is in its application.
In an interview with Aktuně.cz, this is what the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala says.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct for its application - that's what we think is missing,” Kala said.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of malpractice, Peter Netime’s approach to the so-called “shvarcsystem”
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS wouldn't bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is he banned or allowed?
“The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot prevent an office from operating which is obliged to control and enforce its duties,” notes Kala.
At the audit committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, under which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates how public contracts are handled, followed by individual national legislation and then practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even if the control is not yet over, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps even \"more stringent and perfect\" - however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to pay attention to the application of law itself.
What can this project do for you, what does it mean for you?
It could be such a common control that we stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but that does not always mean the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal acts.
But by reducing the contract limit, we do not necessarily have to achieve this.
Perhaps the system will be engulfed with such a amount of paper that those who want to look for holes in that system will draw much easier from it than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the implementation of legislation concerning public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NCU, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, just as the NCU works there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also my college, is just forming a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities are acting similarly.
The powers are also to some extent similar, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so the Courts of Auditors also have at the level of individual federal countries - in which the system differs a little from ours.
BRH can only control the federal money, with us represented by state funds.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
What about the legislation there, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is called a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but again I don't like that comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would not have been a benefit for them to work with our office, would it?
As for the domestic legislation, what has the amendment of the Public Contracts Act meant for your office, do its effects already manifest?
Since the duration of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet shown in our control actions.
Because we are doing ex-post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
We are seeing this only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool - the detection of risks of non-economicity - through which we have overrun almost 14,000 public contracts, and analyzed them - there, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted, and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit, or a further burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that it will “stricken” the rules, and it will not be possible to follow them.
Already during the operation of the previous rules, the controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it to toughen the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal mistake that does not affect decision-making.
Such a system will create only greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And how do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS wouldn't bother the entrepreneur with the controls of the so-called \"shvarcsystem\" - and what does that mean?
Is Swarcsystem Prohibited or Allowed?
The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot prevent an office from operating which is obliged to control and enforce its duties.
He may say, ‘We will change the law and allow it, but he cannot say that we will do anything like that.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are quite strict rules on what is to be done formally - which is correct to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best-supplier is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what we think is missing.
Roads are frozen, but mostly roadside.
In several places of the Czech Republic the roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the roads are usually roadside, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning, the roads were roadside, but the places were frozen and also snowy.
The temperature fell between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
Places were also less visibility due to fog, according to data from the district road dispatch.
R6 speed roads and first class communications are now unlimited in the region.
However, caution is on the spot, for example, on some bridges where the surface can be frozen and sleek.
All second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also cross-country.
In some areas, however, there is still the remains of the frozen and the place of the snow.
Particularly in higher positions, there is a need to pay attention to driving.
the Pardubice and King's Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frostbite, a layer of snow on the roads and mountains, reports the Directorate of Roads and Motorways.
Motorists warn drivers against frost, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice region.
It can be found around Lanškroun, Usti nad Orlicí, Police, Svitav or Vysoký Myth, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav.
The snow is mainly on roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest position on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, today it is most often clear to semi-clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing a weak wind.
The Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are mobile this morning, but with increased caution and driving needs to be adjusted to the weather.
This is freezing in the morning, temperatures range between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications can be frozen.
The driver must also count on fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is due to the information of the district road crew.
The D5 motorway is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In southern Pilsen and Tachov, however, there may be frozen sections.
Second- and third-class communications are wet, and in this case, the warnings for the frozen sections apply.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent roads in the Sumava area.
Olomouc Region
With snow porridge on the road today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must count.
After the chemical spray, she remained on the Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards the Videlský Cross.
The roads drove snow at night, according to road managers, they snowed about three centimeters on the road.
In other parts of the region, roads are usually roadside without restrictions.
The snow remains in the highest position in the Sumperia.
With snow porridge on the Červenohorské sedle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník,” said ČTK dispatcher of the road administration.
Their colleagues in Jesenicka went into the field at night, and the roads to the highest position are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
There are no restrictions on roads in Olomouc, but drivers should be careful in the forest areas where the roads remained wet.
Ustecky kraj, Liberecský kraj
Several difficult-to-reach places report this morning after the roadmaker in northern Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or glaciers, the mountain roads from Telnice to Knínice in Ústeck are closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are also held in lower positions below zero, so that the ice and snow seem to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Republic, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications are not reported yet.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by roadmakers especially from the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists for her at night, the ideal conditions - during the day of rain and melting snow, at night were clear and frosty.
Unfavorable conditions on road I/13 at the border of the region of Ustecké and Liberec are reported from the main moves.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice forced the bent branches of the trees, which under the cover of the snow bended to the road.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it, and we say we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before December 20th from 21st will be held simultaneously 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at a time when the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will once pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other artists, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called “The End of the World”
Is she already very popular on YouTube today, does she also sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in a complete conclusion, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not occur...
All the performers sing at all three concerts at the same time.
Anthems are also connected in a unique direct broadcast on Czech TV.
The words for this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, and in it is also sung by Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoying it.
What will be the result of the concerts against the end of the world?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in Jedliček Institute.
Students of the Jedliček Institute are regularly taught by teachers and engaged in activities they enjoy and are interested in.
Students themselves do not have the means to marry teachers themselves, so we try to enable them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedliček Institute in the future, a separate building will be created, in which we will move with this project.
Several music groups and performers will perform at each concert.
Why did you choose them?
We have tried to build a program that will reach all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan similarbombassic events, even in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time in Prague Spring, so even here we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York next year, and I personally, when we are in the USA, would like to connect this with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, for example, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of disabled people.
How do you manage these ways Logistically and Organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric truck, its carts must travel in the luggage compartment, we also, of course, bring with us a large amount of cargo and box with tools...
However, so far it has always worked without problems, both CSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us that I was as surprised as many times as possible.
Even in Moscow, from which we have recently returned, it was without difficulty.
With trips abroad, you can compare how the individual varies in barrier-freeness, public access to disabled and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have seen in Russia that everything in the East is still in complete beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person to move on an electric wheelchair himself in the center of the city.
There is no such thing as giving wheelchairs a preference in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we still need to hunt for a more advanced country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to note that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In both London and Madrid it is quite common that even people with severe disabilities move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in turn, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or accessibility is one thing, but only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years later, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined as an educator at the Jedliček Institute, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, I set up an interest music ring with my colleague.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovich tells us, a little bit went out of hand (laughter).
But did the popularity come only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to connect with famous singers and also actively work on promoting the band.
We realized that work that is not visible was essentially as if it did not exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to get it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is overcrowded with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way, everything new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that is natural.
But that regret is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not sufferers of all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I'm saying that if something works out for people with disabilities, it's not just for them, it's for the whole society.
Did this success also help by being a strict boss, as many people have called you?
When we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising on many things and require some discipline.
But that's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the exam twice a week, attend the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, they are excited to leave quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Láď Angelovich.
We are an open group, people leave and come, this cannot be prevented.
Anyone who has the will and taste always has the door open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 2nd from 21 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected by telemost at the end of the evening to sing the song of The Tap Tap - The End of the World.
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for equipment of a multifunctional barrier-free educational centre of the University of Jedliček Institute in Prague in the volume of 25 million CZK
Entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free entrance tickets in presale Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years it has participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
However, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights before World War II; but they did not always encounter understanding.
For example, I recall the lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 represented ideas from his pioneering work Entering the cosmonautics.
The ideas of a young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cool, and after years, Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, he won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his entry into space science in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned cosmonautic promoter and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925, a railway track was built in Poland, which was supposed to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and neither the details of the project are known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the launch of the drainage or for its braking.
Information about this sink is known only from the period press.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to deal with rocket missiles.
The research was provided by the Chamber of Armament Techniques in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustaw Mokrrzyckigi.
From preserved materials, it is clear that research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, at the arrival of the German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, a draft of a photoelectric fighter missile was introduced in the professional press, designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year, the work of the Missile was published - an air-torpeda and a rocketbomb of the author Lilni-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use of missile technology were devoted to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory Committee) which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended the beginning of the war.
Other works devoted to cosmonautics appear after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polish Astronautic Society).
For the first time there is a mention of the company in the November issue of the 1954 magazine Problems, in which four more comprehensive articles are devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a perspective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has been seeking entry into the International Astronautic Federation (founded 1951) and has already become an ordinary member of PTA in autumn.
And in the following year, the first chairman of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became the vice-chairman of the International Astronautic Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has significantly contributed to the development of the very successful meteorological missile RM (Metrological Missile), which became the first Polish rocket to be carried out by scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The 1800-metre-access rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was later built and in the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another developmental type was already to be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile was supposed to have access to up to 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
The first RM-type rocket was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, differing in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres was available.
Maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aeronautical Institute was developing the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The meteor-2H and meteor-3 versions were built.
It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remk.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a live discussion in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, nothing limitless movement of private capital, along with a boundless financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labour, (while) price tensions occur.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer tries to stand in competition by importing cheap goods by subduing the competitor’s price in order to take a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus also responsibility for its generated unemployment, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is amplified by the absolute unwillingness of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes, thereby replacing the economic and social damage he has committed in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The carefree practices of private capital create situations in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to their own population, regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the changes in applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to adopt a price dictatorship of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and by limiting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with an increase in the differences between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN there have been many years of public food outlets for the poor, who are unable to feed their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is common for properly employed people to receive such a wage that the state has to pay them to the existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Council.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people are forced under pressure from a catastrophic decline in the social level either to emigrate as they did in the 19th century or to live for hungry wages at the edge of society in the hope that private investment capital may come to the country once.
But here it is necessary to ask where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media have argued that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists on the view that the State must not interfere with the economy by means of management interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, now it actually governs politics, and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is a clear answer, yes.
The evidence is that there is practically an omnipotent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that the State Ministry for the Deficiency of Funds provides proposals for laws to private legal firms that are densely linked to industry.
These draft laws are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type proclaim, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly coming to a situation, as Appianos describes it in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompey: “The state has long been in complete decomposition and the authorities have been occupied by violence.
For bribes, unlawfully obtaining favorably and with the help of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were baffling without any barriers, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold voice - 'characteristic people did not apply for the office at all, so once as a result of this collapse there was a state of eight months without consuls'. 'It really began to talk about the fact that the only drug in bad situations is self-control and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man.' - Appianos thought of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who turned it into a permanent democracy into a self-control.
As in antiquity, the present society is based on a careless preference for its own benefit, regardless of the nationwide interest.
Private capital is no longer capable of understanding and applying a nationwide benefit.
The result is now, as at that time, an impeccable decadence of the elite without any effort to reform the deeper character.
Thus, the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the careless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As a state of play, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of another round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the present elites completely ignore the possible hundreds of thousands of losses in life, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already witnessed with crimes against humanity, as we know it from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from competition at both international and internal European levels, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the state’s capital participation in the economy, strengthen citizens’ influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing comes out of violence, and never can,” Sting in Fragile’s song, whose main verse in the refrene is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
If my sons did not want war, there would be none - the dying Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have developed.
One stands behind Israel, arguing his right to self-defense, and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed on Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fits the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodic waves of killing the guilty and who is the victims, after all the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
It is about offering readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who the 95-year-old tension (calculated from Balfour’s Declaration in November 1917) is primarily serving on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the historical facts available, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can find some of that Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been those personalities who have completely autonomously guided their actions, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the life of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, there is one that could be considered the head of the Octopus (if one still stands above them, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschields.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s to stop linking their name with the highly criminal acts in which they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the central bank shares are not being waged or prepared for war (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to resist this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore his central bank status to the Rothschield Bank of America, began spending his own money during the Civil War, and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, he was murdered 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led between 1859 and 1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars by the masonry of the highest, 33rd degree consecration by Albert Pik.
The first war was intended to remove the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial rule, especially the United Kingdom, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a pre-field for such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families in charge of Rothschieldy work is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, so as not to repeat the crisis as one caused in 1907).
So after they managed to start the First World War in Sarajevo by murdering the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne of Ferdinand, they destroyed the Tsar Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy the Tsar Russia) and subsequently there was a fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria Hungary.
To facilitate the start of World War II, policy bankers had created a latently conflicting situation by imposing huge war-reparations on Germany, thus creating the assumption of radicalization of the surplus masses, and then it was enough for them to plant enough strong, blameful and simple solutions to offer the Leader and, further, to create multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also to play, the function of the fifth column, in the sparking of a warfire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield was inspired by the founding of the Zionist Movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferred in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out of the chain where international bankers initially held it, or everything he did was hard to guess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany’s war reparations, was earned at World War II, a third-war outbreak was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If international bankers are able to start it, the Jewish people, like the other, will be victims in the first line of struggles, now together with the Arab or the general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (regard how strongly people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the wrong produces a wrong in the endless chain of violence, when in the beginning the greed of individuals and their desire for global power stood at the beginning of everything?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are pushing people to choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascising, to international bankers loyal, a policy that does everything to wage a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to grow into a global conflict and, given the control of Iran over the Hormuz Strait, which travels 20% of all world oil (the sailing corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order.”
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a totally controlled being.
“And he forces all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have them on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that he cannot buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of her name.
This is to be understood: who has reason, let him count the numbers of the beast.
This is the number of a person, and it is the number of six hundred and sixty-six.
Argo: When He's the Hottest, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, he occupied a crowd of Islamist students from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Réz Páhavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which was the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive starting point - it could not afford to throw the shah over the deck, as it would seriously compromise trust among allies in other countries.
The release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after the negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their work at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The Iran debate contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter’s loss with Ronald Reagan at the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that America has brought about a small victory.
Six employees fled from the embassy just before the embassy was occupied.
After the complex peripetia, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In cooperation with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran, helping an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of a film crew watching locations in the country for sci-fi film.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by an expert on exfiltration, Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood’s cooperation.
To be credible, the legend was written about a film project in specialized magazines, held a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically understood political thriller, at the same time a so-called \"caper movie\" - a story of a successful piece, a subjugation - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, the moods change - on the one hand, documentary sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic historical photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences in it).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - the men in the clothes are breaking down the situation at the negotiating tables, in the halls of the office, in the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
He became a respected director from a mocked actor and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic notes.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crimson of the Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film, which does not take place in director’s home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the site was one of the characteristics that the director’s older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also manifests him in Argu, where Tehran - plays - Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arises when history moves somewhere brightly.
Affleck and his co-workers achieve a similar effect in fabricated scenes (false staff on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
He works very successfully with it, sometimes he thinks about reality - there's nothing so elegantly going on (a scene in which the threatening crisis at Tehran airport turns off the phone call in America and the chase after the morning works quite attracted to the hair).
However, the weakness of Arga is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, but their characters would deserve more space and are far from the only one in the film.
Affleck's film is a bit of a loss of dramatic move, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evocating thrillers of the 1970s.
But it's hard to tear down.
As a reminder of one way of living history so far, as well as a proof of how exaggerated the ideas of omnipotent and omnipotent secret services are, are sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipopayy.com server, which announces an annual survey about the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to award a competition for “the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop”
“We have been led to this latest event, where the EU is planning to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies,” said Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, there is a recent decision by the European Court of Justice to unify insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women in life insurance prices have been favoured because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The EU’s controversial regulation also includes the mandatory mixing of bio-components into fuels, which, as a result of nature’s damage, also prohibits the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances or a directive on the size of chicken cages, because of which it has significantly expensive eggs this year.
Criticism had previously also faced a factual ban on using the term anointing butter or the removal of classical bulbs from sales.
Quality bananas have 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of one or that trade or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a country or group of states (so the Czech Republic now promotes the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and could not show an anomalous curvatures -
The European Commission has defended itself by only harmonizing the existing non-united national standards that have made trading more difficult.
EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the resistance of some states, with a reference to the fact that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for winning the poll may also be the EU regulation last year, according to which it must be mandatory for sold inflatable balloons to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate without supervision of adults.
The EU referred here to American research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children to suffocate.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 years of age when blowing into pilgrimage fringes.
Curious ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is relatively absurd - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire has nominated the EU Food Stocks Regulation in the Member State as well as some of the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU established the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the specified volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The poll organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies at the request of obtaining subsidies.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are disabled because we don’t have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund,” said the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that we had a lot of grain born, and as a result of so-called intervention purchases, it was supposed to be full of warehouses that he had to import.
For having the Czech Republic further to ports, the EU was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally came out to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grains from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidies were offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically to write a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While the Regulation is easy to address in the Member States criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to operate more effectively and develop the whole Union, according to a number of experts, are more worthy of recognition.
The more serious problem is, for example, the drawing of EU subsidies on projects that have no indication of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The emotions among the Czech Republic also encourage the Czech Republic to fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, and not always succeed in this match.
The Czechs, after a six-year struggle with the Germans and the Austrians, defended the designation of Olomouc shapes, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed a domestic.
The names of rum can only be worn from cane spirits, not sugar beet products.
In the official list of EU registered products, the world-renowned feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, and Parma hams have already been found, for example, in the Carlsbad droughts, mountainous and třeboňa carp and the Žatek hops.
The EU trade mark can then also be proud of the Pardubian ginger and bitter tubes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
I'm not talking about being a senator or president.
If it works without problems in our country, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been stealing for the past 20 years, how thieves are running, how taxes and retirement age are increasing for people.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to figure out how to change it.
And since I'm 40 and I'm an independent impartial, I have no other way to influence things than running for a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying all the time that I'm going to go to the battle for the Castle according to the result in the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected Senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool, how I can realize my vision.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
However, the problem is not only that as a nation we broadcast in the pub and on television, but that we will trample anyone who wants to try to change.
This is added to the media that dehonestate man and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told I was paying a journalist or I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
In the fight for the Castle you have gone with the thesis of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and return on property over 20 million.
You have to change the law to do this.
As president, you don’t have that power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When, as a citizen, I lobbyed for free trade as a guide, it was possible to do so.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal from the left or right, they are strongly rejected, and this is a delay for citizens.
As an independent impartial, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are better off on the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go ahead.
I don't care if someone is on the left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You're looking like someone's telling you you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Someone might call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they were talked about by significant experts.
But without the support of the parliament, only passwords will be left.
This is not enough for long-term politics.
Or do you think that when you walk with people and talk to them, you will be able to assert, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists, and the public and try to get them to their side in order to enforce it.
If elected president, there is no problem in organizing a direct television broadcast, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
When a strong personality, who will name the nonsense, can be pushed to the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.
I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and vision, I try to seek allies.
I have just started in politics and will try to get a majority of support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work, I'm going to end up in six years and I'm going back to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a Savior.
I know they're not doing anything in one person, so I've been around a lot of familiar people to see if they'd run for the Senate either.
I went to Radim Jančura, he refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who was spreading light oil scams.
I've been running for people to be really dissatisfied, but now I'm on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to elections, and those who went were mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have voted for the Senate so that changes are difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as for direct election of mayors or captains.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the pure past of every potential party, and I don’t even have money for it.
I don't have money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artworks for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, Aston Martin is because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who used to ride in the car, was a gallant to women, and at the same time he fought against the evils and the bads.
You drive Aston Martin, you own 60 million and you don't have money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it much.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
Am I supposed to be in debt?
I've been in the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that I don’t think there’s such an interest in my program.
I have no obligation to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I will receive from the senator.
But I wouldn't get out of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd shut down these activities?
But that's not related to the salary.
As I promised, I partially suppressed my activities.
For example, my representative will become a travel agent in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much were you as an entrepreneur used to taking monthly?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I take on.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Saturday issue of Rights.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don't just take place in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain Books - 2 photos
“This building looks fun to me, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large enterprise, says: “Of course, the house is nice.”
I wonder what we need a library for today.
Everyone has internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old-style libraries come to this day voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, a residence in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education across the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision to contribute to general education and to build seven well-painted concrete miniatures of fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes was made.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not inconceivable.
And so the city councillors knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
The wines of Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, the master of insane column charts and the maker of funny, often cynical buildings, adopted the thing with usual calm and appeared at the competition in 2003 with five books under the arms and a glimmer on the face.
And while the commission still stared at each other and shrugged his shoulders, Maas cast his gifts on himself by size and ended his activistly justified speech with the words “Loved City Village”:
So this is my proposal for a Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded second place -Best Library of NL 2012 -
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small town gray, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind which you would rather expect a dairy shop, makes it a bit richer for contemporary architecture.
First of all, Spikenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Path to the Book
First impression: the reader's eldorado under the cover of cheese.
Although there is an elevator in the massif of the mountain, you will discover real spatial and reader-friendly passions only when you walk through the topography.
From all sides, the glass interior is bright and transparent, the floor from the burned cabin and the elegant street lucerne clearly expresses the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normal stands shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly cozy and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have built the classic spatial configuration upside down, and we have brought the reader's space out of the inside.
The interior of the Book Mountain is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a headquarters of home technology.
A special pleasure is the black shelves for books, which are once a wall lining, one sill and another railing of stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell work foreign.
Over the unknown building material twists the heads even conceded architects and construction engineers.
“We wanted to work here with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the town village of Spijkenisse, on the question of the magazine Standard.
And so, in one French farm, one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years it has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a basis under the roots of a millimetre synthetic router.
It is cheap and time efficient.
The thin fabric lasts one, two seasons, and then it is mature to throw into bulky waste.
For the library, the router - for the first time in such a quantity - was pressed on plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
By acting the heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored in dark, homogenous and loadable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 meters long journey, you will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
“You might not believe it, but despite many glass surfaces, this house is a sample project in terms of ecology,” said Trouborst.
It heats up and cools with Earth's heat.
Although the mountain of the books stands under the glass lid, the sun only shines in it briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden ligaments, which stand parallel to the glass facade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be able to handle fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes Boekenberg as “a long-awaited soul” Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every city citizen was invited to open several weeks ago to devote one book from his personal fund.
This was to be done first with optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently consists of 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely filled.
“There is nothing worse than a semi-empty library,” says the architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone has a certain relationship to the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
The MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called identity formation in the professional jargon.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: “Germany must play a bigger role”
Germany abstained from voting in decision-making on the adoption of Palestine.
According to the U.S.-Europe relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against a proposal for the observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Shabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it will support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libya Uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was the end of NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy from a policy that was so-called US-led to German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult for Europeans to have no coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think that they are still living in their role, but they are on their way to a more “normal” foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the readiness to be interested in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect attitudes in the Middle East conflict and vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large outlet in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to scare the public, but neither elites in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays a role.
But I would not like to attribute too much importance to this, it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany’s relations with the United States damage when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the U.S. there is a great understanding of the German stance.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a bad thing as it was in Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even benefit from some respect.
This indicates that it must be considered an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly spoken for the veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. internal policy.
I think Obama’s government probably has a significant understanding of European attitude.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, this position cannot be held public.
I think that differences in opinions are not as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very excited about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for Germany if there were a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not happening.
Therefore, they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
This is what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take on a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European stance.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Do they want to take on the lead?
Or is it still difficult for Germany to lead?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a role.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, there will be anti-German sentiments.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The impact of the US on European politics is now constantly falling, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don’t like it, they feel uncomfortable and make it even more unpopular - c’est la knows!

Protection of brands - in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
There is a designation behind it, which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as they are not sued by the actual owners of the brand.
It is not even clear whether they can do the law.
“It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
There's a new case on my desk every week.
A few more letters are enough for counterfeiters to sign up for their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens the organizer with records of the sign office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the Zegna DF Puma brand. An artificial name that parasites even on the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several storeys, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
However, Pattloch's cases are different. On behalf of his mandants, he is acting against Chinese companies receiving from the sign office the right to use a sign that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it \"Bang Mingpai\" an associated brand.
This word focuses on “Bang Dakuan”
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“It harms business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch calls.
“The mark is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the image damage is enormous.”
The financial losses and the court costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is the third largest market in luxury goods and the fastest growing market.
However, it is difficult to delete dubious records in the register of brands and it costs something.
Driving can take up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court rejected the action, because the alleged name became after a long period of time - a market reality -
When the defendant has a bad luck, he must still pay the plagiariser because he has damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the Jungle Law is here.
Known cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, an enterprise recently taken over by a German pump manufacturer on a concrete mixture of Putzmeister.
The Chinese, therefore, are still allowed to use an emblem similar to a Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Lacoste's fashion product manufacturer lost in China with counterfeits from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO acknowledges that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and space.
But last year, he reportedly - the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal -
For example, the number of pending proceedings on objections decreased by 22%.
57,000 cases were closed, 75% more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
Doing something against it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China has a list of new applications around the world for the tenth time.
This also applies to the number of all applicable trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were charged.
This simply means that each login costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To begin with, the dispute costs several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
Although the Germans achieved that his illegal production of imitated automotive parts was abolished.
However, the counterfeit secured Chinese rights to the brand Freudenberg continued.
We would have forgotten this ourselves, because in Germany the last name cannot be protected, says HannaWentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munich firm.
In another two instances, Freudenberg has been able to claim rights, but the opponent continues to fight in the dispute.
You have to be very careful.
The case is now being discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has the confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: “Controlling is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves.”
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the archive of the company, they had to even look at a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty a high six-digit amount in euros to settle the dispute.
“You can see what that means to us,” saidWentzler.
Europe is also threatened by the dangers of the Far East.
This is the case if the imitators are provided with unprotected marks.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to register the Freudenberg marking for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business was abandoned by the company long ago, yet it was able to reverse the registration.
“You have to be very careful,” saidWentzler.
He and his lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights. Foreigners should rather - everything that is worth protecting in any way, to log in in China too - saysWentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: if Freudenberg, in the last act of his drama, falls to the brand, then he may have to pay the counterparty the licence fee for his own name, according toWentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Assembling, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is tested - and in Swaziland, orphans after parents who died of AIDS are happy to do so.
The story of a connection that exceeds much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, there's an ass: Cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins are looking for a tact on the floor and they're finding it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - insist, mom, and pursue each other.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopfa, almost picks it up from his textile shoes when he joins voices with his boldly wild gestures.
It's Monday night at the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology's music hall, trying a new song by Imbongi.
It came to 50 singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human genetics researcher to a homeowner.
\"Om'Obani\" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different text, and yet in a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Fighting Program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide live infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after their parents died of AIDS.
HIV is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans who died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in Esitjeni, Germany.
70 of them attend second grade school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child a school uniform and one warm meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means, in the language of the zulu, “the storyteller” or “the one who praises”
No one can speak in this space, just sing.
For almost ten years he has been practicing the choir of songs in this foreign soft speech and sometimes he also brings them back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, the village of Esitjeni depends on the power of the voices of the German congregation.
40 percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay or straw, and many of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they died of HIV.
In Esitjeni, it is seen in the small, the wall of the entire Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity in themselves, and there is no rare thing that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by a congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. But above all, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, they have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send the child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the Voices for Africa Society was established, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mushrooms and scabies are among the parasitic SPIs.
Who belongs to the most affected group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur often are chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (flies), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in us, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV fall on this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syphilis has been more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were 2,700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than a year before.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectional diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urinating, discharge, pain in the abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The danger of infection can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
For the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially passed on from dirt infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In case of early diagnosis, most SPIs can be cured and later consequences prevented.
Thanks to the patronage, charity gifts and, last but not least, the honoraries that the congregation earns by singing throughout Germany, some money will be collected.
“We have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
The money from Germany is managed by a self-confident woman in the village of Zodwa Dalmini.
She also makes sure that orphan children find shelter, for example, in some of her grandmothers.
Gogo, as the language of the zulu is said to the old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and took care of their children getting in uniforms every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by society as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
\"Voices for Africa - in addition, it founded a sewing school, built two chickens and, together with the US health organization PSI, arranged that many people in the village had taken the HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King With 14 Wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, quite strange in the country where the king officially retains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his meagre lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also responsible for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free at every corner, but no one uses them.
Culture is a different - unprotected relationship -
To support cultural exchange at least a little bit, the Imbongi choir travels once every two or three years in the south of Africa together and sings songs full of sadness, combativeness, trust in the future and confidence in blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already exuded tears at many wild border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on the maps, the Ezulweni valley is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is light,” people say.
And when you come back to Heidelberg, which is an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from here, to the fucking singers in the Bergheimer Straß trial room, you can see that the light is shining here.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday by expert magazine Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the area of this planet that lies in a permanent shadow.
It is reported to be at least 30 centimeters thick and perhaps even up to 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not put ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said lead scientist working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life have entered other areas of the solar system.
Sondas, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved terrestrials, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth, a small window into endless distances.
The film comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits Neptune around the Sun, Ceres is not, according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union, a planet.
This cut-out from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a family portrait - countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pink-colored - novorozene - at the birth hall of stars.
This area, where stars are formed - scientists call it non-romantic W5 - discovered by Spitzer's telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light years.
This variable heat dying stars captured the Spitzer telescope NASA.
The wolk ring consists of the material that the star exterminated during the dying process.
In the giant Nebula Trifid, which is 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
A photograph of the galactic-clothing camera was taken by Spitzer’s NASA telescope.
The starry Pleiades, also known as the 'Seven Sisters', is seen by the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, colors will stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observers in this infrared image.
It is 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the Earth’s continent brought this nebula to the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of unusual coloration.
This, the baby, was able to shoot up the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors in full beauty between the stars.
Saturn and his rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
It may be the remains of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of Hubble's largest and sharpest images of the telescope: a vortex galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloration, become real works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows several thousand light years of the distant Trifid Nebula in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word ‘trifidus’ (divided into three parts, triple clan), because the dark stripes of dust divide the hot heart of this stellar obstetrician into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonoš, astronomers photographed a presence of cosmic precipitation: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, a woman of two colliding galaxies must inevitably collide.
This star’s birth was recorded by Hubble’s telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who does not like technical shortcuts can call it the South Winderman.
Photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope show the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefea.
This 1400 light-years distant nebula consists of dust grains, which are ten to one hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a black hole ring that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded Hubble’s space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to new additions.
Also, this star cloud, associated with the Rosette Nebula, is giving birth to still new young stars. They are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
There is no dust in this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was created only shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views on space: the most important telescopes
The telescope allegedly invented Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow - and the views they convey are becoming deeper and deeper.
The world’s largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale’s telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this image had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe with the help of two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, its diameter is about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of cheap design: the telescope is provided with a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light flow.
Despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, this will match the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecib (Portorico), scientists are searching for extraterrestrial signals in space.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI) search for extraterrestrial intelligence, any computer owner that gives it its computing performance can help.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is a Very Large Telescope - and it is an honor for its name.
This telescope, with a total of four mirrors, can also provide medium infrared spectrum.
The European Very Large Telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is 42 meters full and consists of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck’s telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into the universe using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is to form a new giant telescope - with a 30-metre mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most significant impressions of the universe are mediated by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Photos of distant worlds have been provided to us since April 24, 1990.
Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The image documents the latest preparations before the Kepler space telescope is launched.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space in 2018 on the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists say there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messenger circles around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to Messenger, which was sent in 2004, and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be of Bible age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Finding tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be of Bible age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Finding tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call the Tallyš mountain ride wildly romantic.
The minibus rides along the road with many turns along densely forested hills, predatory rivers and simple Selic buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the oldest south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here there is a caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh people, which is not very well known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is fraught with too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not drive here. The arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes 8 hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The fairy-tale wealth for which the country owes its gratitude in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
But Fatulaev's Pilate (48) believes that Lerik has the right to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku celebrated the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and next year we will have the oldest people festival in the world,” Fatulaeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Long Age, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Tales from the surroundings, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulaev shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still gave birth to a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep, ’irali Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest man with documents was 122 years old, Müslüm’s age seems extremely dubious.
“He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulaev explains.
This man was reportedly three times married and had 23 children at the age of 136 he still had a daughter.
Did he not make a mistake about Müslüm at his age by a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the people in Central Asia.
“A number of people of high age also live in some areas of China, Japan or Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “there are extremely many very old men living in Sardinia too.”
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is that people around Lerik experience Bible age quite often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many people live in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Tales.
The director of the Fatulev Museum, on the contrary, believes that this lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the caloric diet of the Talysh people who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem to be credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzaev lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young at this geographical width.
Mirzaev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttercrumb that he tirelessly digs.
There are eight people under one roof, including one of Mirzayev’s sons and daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are two small children around.
In the kitchen, the guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical abdominal glasses -armad -
The white teeth of Mirzayev make up the perfect line and under the jacket hides a long dark blonde copy, which proudly reveals her son.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look and keep color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” says Mirzaev.
Monthly retirement is enough
She always ate what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven’t bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything improved when the row was taken over by the beloved father, Gejdar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, a cult that is made around the figure of the father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator does not know the limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and then took over his son Ilham.
Older people in Azerbaijan do not at least suffer from distress.
Mirzayev receives a pension of 230 manatas every month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is on the local ratio of the amount from which it can be well used.
And perhaps the old son of Mirzaeva is right: “Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture.”
They live in the midst of a large family, they are loved, baked and happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of “human rights” is lacking in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The depraved demonstrations in Cairo revealed the deep fragmentation of the country.
There is a strong discussion of the future constitution based on Sharia law.
The president of Egypt did not save by pathos.
We need to create a transition.
“And for doing this, I am responsible for it, before people and before God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly disputed in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of “God’s state” on the Nile, given to the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he temporarily limited the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to “save the revolution”
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who holds a doctoral degree in the American University of Southern California really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about it.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which the hundred-hour Constitutional Assembly with the predominance of Islamists hastily approved in the 15-hour night marathon, partly raise concerns.
As in earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on the ‘principles of Islamic law’.
But what does it mean “principles”?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and associated legal free space for a more rigorous interpretation of Sharia.
At least this illuminates the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on all Sunni Islam.
This may not, but it may mean that the cleric will exercise oversight of the legislation, which would bring justice to a factual withdrawal of its own right.
There are many interpretations in the draft constitution
The problem is that civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak’s government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, it should also protect the right nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values.
This is legally formulated so inaccurate that through this paragraph state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
This means nothing but censorship.
In other words, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
But another paragraph prohibits shame or defamation of the prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
However, it is unclear what shame is and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally doubtful that it is forbidden to “injure people”
Is it enough in this case for the President's cartoon or a joke on the account of lawmakers?
The matter of interpretation, like much more in this proposal, which Mursi will present for signature and, according to his words, will be - very soon - present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular vote.
The Revolution has come back -
For several weeks, the opposition has been formed against the anti-Islamist crisis.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional document before it started to pay.
“The revolution has come back and we will win,” said Hamdín Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Prize-winning carrier and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed Baradej, said the draft constitution belongs to “the waste of history”
Twitter has accused Mursi’s supporters of carrying out a “no-democracy coup”
“If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” opposition member Jásir Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished,” said Chalid Ali, an Egyptian opposition politician.
Several judges said they did not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
The Qur’an is our Constitution.
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a rebirth, but with caution not at Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
Many women and supporters of the Salafis took part in her, saying, ‘People demand the application of God’s law.’
They called upon Mursi: “Pure the earth,” and assured them, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, on which everything began, would probably trigger a state similar to civil war.
Mursi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had expressed loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the urns decide which direction the country should go.
A majority is considered for the sake of the Islamist proposal.
\"The word 'human rights' does not occur once.
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should in fact continue until February and integrate all social forces, marks the Háfize Abu Sa'du.
The eight-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
“And in the new constitution, the words ‘human rights’ are not even once,” he said in an interview with ‘Welt am Sonntag’.
Mursi's expansion of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the president of civil society, he actually cancelled it,” Sa’da said.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned even by the international community, which follows the match of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could get rid of that.
A demonstrator at Tahrir Square warns: ‘You have created a monster that you can no longer control.’
Norway's most fragrant fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country’s success be associated with a local appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let the week lie down.
So you get the smell of a carnation, one of Norway's biggest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a wonderful view - and in the air hangs an omnipresent smell.
The rakfisk is a salty sore fermented in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it darkens and starts to be cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to meet at a festival dedicated to this, as to say it best, the most captivating food.
“You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called ‘Rakfisk General’, who is responsible for the festival’s course.
All around us people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
“Some people prefer to aquavit rather than rakfisk,” says Havard.
The drink can overcome the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus journey.
Cancer is the product of a very different period of time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish soaked into airtight barrels with water and salt in the fall.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well-leavened, pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt got drunk with alcohol.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% are immigrants attracted to large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival who was much richer than Norway recently, are flowing to the country for work.
The carnation is seen as something important, indispensable, even though quite perceiving part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will put you at 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global news - and most people seem to be doing so.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still being mentioned here.
Instead, the shooting is called the July 22 event.
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful land one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway’s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, presents a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as you say, considerate people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the local people, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show up, we don't like to showcasing.
Norway treats its oil wealth very carefully - apart from a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial collapse threw away the money they didn't have, the Norwegians had the cords tight on their moth.
“As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy,” Anna says.
“And eating a carnation,” he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in the front for something to eat - I've had enough of the carnation.
Such a lot of burger is certainly something else and is beautifully juicy.
But tonight is the smelly fish again.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where the rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the most demanding fish.
They have a connection with live television, in which the moderator with the butterfly is surrounded by a plate with a carnation.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
What score do you have for the best fish there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?
“Here’s our scoring, Havard.”
There's a lot of praise and laughter.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps made possible by an aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes of all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is locked even in the best times, there were steel barriers that closed several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent the arriving people from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive a presidential sword and take over the leadership of the nation.
They are facing a difficult task.
Mexico did well at the time of the departure of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in a pair of a drug war that has already been estimated to have killed 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he shaked his hand with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
It is attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the rough and bumpy roads that were there before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
“We expect it to bring real and lasting change,” says Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a political ally for President Pen Niet, Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for interesting and real changes in the security and economics that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Mr Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, many are expected to be inside the party by Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And rejects the opposition characterizing the new president as a man without material content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested with an excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezhualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nepo, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Imposed under the highways in many ways, it resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called to help cope with drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially burning violence against women.
Only in the last two years, dozens of women have been killed in desert places next to a huge landfill of waste.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pen Niet say that in his office he failed to deal adequately with the problem of murder of women.
And in a worse case, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of the fragile neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believed her partner had murdered her.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked as if someone had washed her body,” says Mrs Buendia.
There were signs of strokes on him, and after death he began to become stiff.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is one word: ‘Justice’
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they have been denied.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old woodcracker, a troublemaker and a priest.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But it can’t be right when there are so many mistakes and omissions,” he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto receives on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority during his office.
“I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor,” said MP PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of victims in Ciudad do not fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, the military prosecutor says.
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations about gross custody treatment.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of gross treatment with Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of secret material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the gross treatment he reportedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor, Maj. Ashden Fein, at a cross-intelligence by soldier Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of custody in Quantic, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross hearing, which took place during the hearing carried out on a defence proposal to reject the case against Manning because of the gross treatment at the time of the bond, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents at his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein and Manning went through forms that officers completed after meeting Manning in a prison in Quantic, where he was held in an increased security regime between July 2010 and April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he treated his guards as “excellent” and assessed overall treatment on the facility as “very professional”.
The forms show no complaints about ill-treatment, even though Manning’s officers directly asked him how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that concerns about various problems were expressed orally and that the officers who visited him talked to him about these concerns and suggested that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
“They wrote down “no problems” (after discussing concerns), and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t mention them,” Manning said.
Judge-in-law, Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his person’s treatment in January 2011 when he met the suicide commission, which he had previously expressed in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the regime - prevention of injury -
The Army said it used this restrictive regime (one degree under the regime of suicide) to protect and protect others.
“I wanted the custody guards to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a detention prison at the Marine Base in Quantic, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and he fainted once because of heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was going on in the surrounding world was very daunting.
“My world has shrugged only at the base of Arifjan, on the cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, blanket, tincture, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about the treatment of soldier Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manninga also asked about the allegations he filed on Thursday regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantica naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other fellow prisoners in the morning counting.
Manning said he was not allowed to hide his blanket when counting.
On Friday, the judge Manning said he had decided by order of his guards that he had a blanket he could cover, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he could use a belt from his underwear or his ringers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that night his underwear, his notebooks and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before the military court, the beginning of which is expected at the beginning of the next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it plans to admit Manning to guilty in lower crimes and to fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the terms and conditions of custody as legitimate.
The Pentagon said Manning had been held in compliance with the regulations on all arrested prisoners with maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include helping the enemy, illicitly causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, transferring information on national security and stealing public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My Crisis Mexican-American Identity
He says many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely got through the crowd and arrived in the area for an immigrant agenda where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one pro-Mexicanos, the Mexicans, and the other pro- Extranjeros.
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in high California, and I've been called \"Mexican\" for my whole life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston are called 'Iry', and my friends in New York call themselves 'Italy'.
So later I ended up with the term \"Mexican American\"
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to speak both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have a native speaker's vocabulary and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and put myself in the front for \"Extranjeros\"
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama’s White House this week.
They had common affairs on the agenda when the leaders of the two countries met: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is equally likely that the Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under the threat of arms to transcribe half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over centuries, not minutes, the comments are omnipresent.
So a minute after the U.S. official says something just a little critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and between the elite of complaints about how Americans interfere with the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will go on a war path.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about enemy feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are both winners and defeats, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or great-grandparent who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we're living in an American dream now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living an American dream, not a Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
He sees us as a reminder of the humiliation of defeat and he looks at us as a submissive race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico did not fail, they would never leave.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because the Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans do not like it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You will get the best from both countries, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and a part of intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “providing ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and push political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States of America for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel disapprove of how their family members were treated in a much closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we’re more Mexicans than I thought.
The Old Battles, the New Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed indicates that every such incident is wasted.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many buildings were transformed into ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed. And for the first time rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, the Middle East is changing everywhere around them.
The Arab Spring changed the old order, and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are captured in the upcoming chaos in the region.
Maybe it will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their deadly heel situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are currently not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21st lasted, this week’s battles strengthened the cranes on both sides.
Hamas leaders, an Islamic movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to retreat even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the planet’s most deplorable and populous corners, Hamas failed to destroy Israel.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently managed by its covered rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists all over the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the resurrect regional power that once was Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, and Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The glooming Hamas people say that the Islamic half-month is encircling around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah Party/Military, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly cloning to Islamism, can settle down Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influential by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded from Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardline supporters will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology Hamas was placed back in the box.
The Israeli missile system Iron Dome proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a moment.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries also blame Hamas for starting the last round of violence.
And above all, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although the Gaza rockets have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been quite peace of mind in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what may once be the Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Likud, at the beginning of the campaign, joined the election held on 22 January with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil those sneaky Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, would they not launch missiles, as their compatriots in Gaza did?
It'll be better if we hold them behind that wall and knock them out when they put their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Even though Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than the spending of all its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a new war with local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments to heal their economy.
The fact that President Mursi has worked with President Barack Obama to stop the fire is a good sign and may be the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates a vampireing of Palestinians’ rights to self-determination of a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - as well as a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
At present, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state and demography is still deteriorating as the Arab population grows.
The bloody outages against Gaza, taking place every few years to push Hamas, will increasingly collect a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers proclaim: two states, when Israel will move the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping fire will give pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the promotion of the matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to settle to stop the supply of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside must also push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.
President Obama also has a part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be equally abominable in its entry into the process.
That's sadly shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on ugly cigarette packaging
On unsightly green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands, warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body are shown.
Australia’s laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the first of its kind in the world, and the brand’s logos and colors have replaced generic olive green boxes with abominable images of the sick parts of the body and depicted children and newborns sick as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, from Saturday, the only difference between the brand names boxes, which are printed in the same small letter.
This is the world’s strictest regime for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by getting rid of their attraction.
It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking until the age of 26, there is a 99% chance they will never smoke.
“Even in very young children, you can see that he understands the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with his product,” said the Federal Minister of Health, Tina Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, that children are linking the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has heavily lobbied against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase trade in the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeits from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone cigarette packaging to cover ugly boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding the Australian Supreme Court's laws, increased from nearly zero sales.
Ha said Zico had sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesale retailers and expected new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
As possible, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from a direct look, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you are a marketing professional in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, online space is the unsurpassed place you want to be,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher at Sydney University’s University of Public Health.
Mrs. Freeman has seen an increase in the rating of social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the average Honza.
Do we have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has done his job and created this video, or is the marketing company involved in it?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it handles new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia trade significantly.
The SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws regarding packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Greater laws are considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no influence on me.
I just ignore them.
“You just pull out the cigarette and push the box back,” says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, there's only one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to single boxes, it is harder for him to balance them into shelves.
“It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
“The government should simply ban them completely, then we would say, ‘OK, that’s the end, we’ll close the shop,’” he said, throwing his hands away.
In the world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving day I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is quite annoying, despite distractions by books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and children’s development experts are increasingly coming up with praise for boredom.
They say it’s good to be bored sometimes for us (and our children).
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us today are constantly connected to some screen, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
Should we support boredom?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
“It really has a boring long history,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii, a Latin inscription concerning boredom was found, dating from the first century of our century.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The difficulty is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at research literature and showing the idea of a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience - I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it -
Boredness differs from apathy by the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there is no need for apathy to do anything.
He says that the core of boredom is “disrupting the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slowly passing time.”
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see a problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble focusing.
In his study, The Unengaged Mind: Definite Boredom in Terms of Action, published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV show in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty focusing, but they weren't sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, it can disrupt attention leading to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like looking for the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored.
In fact, he said, now we know that the twisting and gnashing, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
“The research shows that children who are allowed to drill learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit in peace,” said Professor Fenske.
We've all ever experienced boredom - a delay in my flight, a buzzing speaker, a particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed a “Bordom Proneness Scale.”
The scale includes questions like: ‘Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous,’ and ‘I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do them all.’
Using these scales, scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and more external stimulation.
Teenagers are generally insignificant.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if the percentage of boredom would be 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that ‘adolescence is the peak time for boredom,’ which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: “It’s boring good for you.”
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Nude is a way of telling you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most important thing you should do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn how to have fun or drive alone, Professor Fenske said.
“This separate procedure is transmitted from one situation to another,” the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to have fun, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical of her.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are within the reach of constant crushing of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
“We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,” he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he said, “it’s hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off.”
There is no new marijuana law manual in Colorado.
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old student at a vocational school and footballer from South-East Colorado, faces charges of crimes for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and the pipe he used for her smoking.
Mr Orozco said that one day of September went with several friends in Lamar, on plans near the border with Kansas, when it was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was given a call for drug possession and drug use equipment - minor offences, for which there is a fine of $100 for each - and he was given a date of trial.
“They treated us like criminals,” said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote to legalize a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug cases is more on the spot than on the right.
Hundreds of cases of abuses for possession of marijuana have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has ceased to accuse adults at the age of 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado said they would continue with existing marijuana cases, and still blame people for holding.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
“This issue is developing so fast that I don’t know what’s going on,” said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are also crushed by regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a license system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by the date of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol License Board.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent according to which we could follow,” he said.
The Washington Law, the so-called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession yes.
And there are sealed mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state directive on “corresponding access” to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s resorts.
“It will be no more difficult to place licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Oates police chief of the city of Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers, telling them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute for holding a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would stop the accusation of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Prosecutor Ken Buck is a tighter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
At present, the charges of holding 56 grams or less marijuana are faced with 119 people, although many are facing further charges.
“Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they were committed,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer blames adults for holding a small amount.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to reject all ongoing possessions.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce law until it changes,” he said.
While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state revealed with regard to this large state-wide green experiment a deep split between local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused of possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Laws on Marijuana.
“They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they can’t really accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to rely on a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best track to become national testing cases for legalizing drugs.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new borders for legalized sales, and at the same time there are also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Lawyers of legalization of marijuana hope the Ministry of Justice will be submissive.
Despite several arrests of marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients who use it that attracted attention, the federal government mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and other 16 states in operation.
While anti-drug agents probably won’t hit the door to catch a small bag with the drug, it’s likely that they will refuse to allow state-regulated recreational marijuana trades allowed by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser for the administration of President Obama.
Several Coloradon cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved moratoriums for any new marijuana stores, although it will take about a year to open any trade.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and it is likely to enter into force next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where we will issue a license to someone and then we will have a big federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this supplement.
We look at what the community voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to leave Oxford because I was a conservative.”
For their opinion, not only today’s university students are attacked.
I don't remember ever thinking about studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world’s largest headquarters of knowledge, a modern-informed Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my suitcases, and went into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard said I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson openly declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from bloated pots.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigot and barbarous: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest news suggests that the new generation of students to the right of the center suffers similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of Younger Years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views they are - often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are given to them that they are not welcome -
They call for a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation did not help the recently mentioned BBC Two documentary show, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about the student political event that the conservative described as strange and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), was introduced to the show and was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other colleges, conservative students say that they are treated as “sacrifice lambs” because of the introduction of higher education.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told reporters Sunday that the “left-wing influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all.
The 21-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is \"uncomfortable\" while the nineteen-year-old elected president of OuCA, Stephanie Cherill, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members to the right of the center.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I arrived in September 1986, 18-year-old and shamefully shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the University voted to refuse the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
Of the atmosphere, the Stalinists would also be worried.
During the first few days of the initial week, when new students met each other and with professors, I got a taste of the pollen that was supposed to come.
I found that not only do the professors of silence approve the push of conservative pupils, but they also take part in it with pleasure.
A policy of mining bets, privatization and resistance of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wood-clothed listeners.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed, I was not ready.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
I've had enough stiffness.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake dough, was very bile.
“The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or they are simply stupid,” he asked.
The other students were hygienic.
There were tears in my eyes.
“I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your free time, if you are not too busy with social affairs,” said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room.
At school dinner, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight knock on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's right.
Anyone who is suspected of conservativeism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Most conservatives pretend to be Labour.
Later at the local pub, I tried to kiss the coward.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics, and economics, who (what irony) went to Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're infected.
The other students listed with him.
I was sick, dirty.
“How conservatives love each other,” one asked.
He beats each other, doesn't he?
I felt like the homosexuals had to feel before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labourman and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they evolved as a purifier of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an advisor to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who write her speeches.
He wasn't almost there.
He hated the place for its innocence and smallness, and for its inclination to a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he joined a professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started driving from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge from my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dream moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes sighed.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
My heart would break if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the teaching, when another professor of history in complete seriousness declared that I was “enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
Even though I was cold inside, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed my parents, and I called them “old fools.”
The relief was short-term.
The nail in my Oxford career was stunned by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to the Murdoch newspaper.
My door was locked.
I was stuck inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dead weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poison in the educational institute.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers came, but also to this day it hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance rather than fame.”
On the occasion of the exhibition -Valentino: the master of fashion production - which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Naty Abascalová, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence of Isabela I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host the exhibition of Valentina Garavani.
This was confirmed by the designer at the start of the famous retrospective-Valentino: the master of fashion creation, which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
“I love this castle,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which the \"il signore\" Garavani is the only protagonist who, without his esteemed clients, could not be written.
Valentino has always felt captivated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is overflowing with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social ascension: from a simple tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of the international-bohemian cream-
Having a royal family is not bad.
“They don’t at least joke the cigarette tip into a great carpet, as some beautiful pop-music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy it abundantly and with elegance.
“We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad,” explains ex-wife Heini, Thyssen and close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentino has always preferred elegance rather than fame.
He's a star, though.
Valeria Mazz
The designer’s charisma is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
“It’s been many years since we went to dinner after one show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he looked up and was felt his spirit.
All the invited could feel important and loved,” recalls the top model who started working with him during the Paris week of fashion in 1995.
“Never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” he concludes.
The Birthday Show
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly renewed love.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of Somerset House’s galleries was rebuilt into a separate 70-metre-long passage that offers a role exchange: the visitor turns into a model and marches through passages to observe the “community” of dreams that Valentin’s masterpieces wear as a dress she chose to marry Jackie Kennedy at her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that was wearing Monica Vitti in “Night” or a coat made of wool and fur that belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In the audience, the name of the mannequins is September, such as Sibilla Luxemburg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, “I can’t forget it”
I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, vest-gillettes - and jackets from the autumn-Winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
“I give him priority over others for his femininity and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty,” added the former Duchess of Feria.
“I like the colors he uses, they make things brighter, and they give them face-to-face.
The proportions are perfect.
Neither the princess nor the fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how to dress Valentina for the first time.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be young and have the opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses.
It was finally in the late 1990s.
“I bought my first Valentine dress to celebrate my cousin’s castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress with a called, sculpted resin and a top without shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality,\" says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life revolves between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a designer's festive dress - very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that they have in them -
The King of Fashion
The gold nail of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress from her wedding with Pavel Greek in 1995.
To create these silky dress ivory colors with ovary pearls, twelve types of different laces and a length of four and a half meters, four months of work and 25-holes were needed (as the designer calls his cockroaches).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the milestone of the top fashion of the late 20th century, “return of clients from a high society”
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elite-savoir-être, is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Order of Honor of Legions accumulates as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always attracted his chosenness, calmness, modified and perfect appearance,” says Princess d’Arenberg.
“Last time I saw him at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace on him.
When this is said by the princess...
The World's Hardest Craft: Sulfur Carriers in the Kawah Ijen Volcano
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers gamble with their lives and health when they endure 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living by conquering sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day, they have to falsify to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gases escape from the inside of the Earth, and when contacting the air, it passes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur, which weighs up to 70 kg together, it carries them on its shoulder in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for the exhausted carriers to climb the turtles at a pace up because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any knock could cost them life, as happened to one French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur they earn.
When they are up, they make their way around the tourists who photograph them, as if the monkeys were in the circus, and tiredly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company called PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been working in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyramids, cosmetics, dynamism and even whitening sugar.
“Because it’s normally worn 70 kilos, we’ll make about 46 000 rupees (EUR 3.8) for every trip,” Anto, who usually takes three trips a day, explains.
One journey takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although this seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what it would earn in the field.
“The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for coffee collection, and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not as difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulphur: ‘I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam’.
Anto has asthma, bad breathing, he still coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks living in the Kah Ijen volcano three times a day, whose sulphur has already begun to collect its tax on it, even though its face is protected by special masks and glasses.
He has asthma, bad breath, he still coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price she has to pay to achieve her dream.
“I’ll be working for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises more than a decent English.
This compassionate and intelligent young man, who is stressed by fate, could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead do the job of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o’clock in the morning, because the sulphur does not stop to exfoliate at night and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto sets into a crater and illuminates his way with a small lamp, which he has attached to the helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry sulphur from the bottom of the crater on the shoulder of the basket
Although the company has high incomes, sulphur production has not mechanized or provided any equipment to own carriers and with such effort.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the extra charge for photography, which together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) choose the natural park watchmen from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mulses.
“This work is for cattle, and not for people,” Madrusin, a brave 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He manages to raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will last, “as long as possible,” because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Although sulphur burns the throat and cracks in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the dense evaporators that come out of the volcano, the miners say that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases . . . it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulder caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulphur in the volcano, which then carry three trucks along a steep road between the violin and the warehouse in Tamansari, a distance of 18 kilometers.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” says Unainik, opening a wide mouth where several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulphur.
Time is passing, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - crafts that carry out human muls in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporens report that they don’t have children, careers, stress, and cost of living and education.
Singapore’s population needs to grow
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of an advertisement for menthol bonbons, but yet - or perhaps just because - the video spread to YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of the rap, which uses local impressions of the type - we put the bun in the oven - as a mockery of the rate of birth in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes to alert them with this ad in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, artistic director of the agency, said he wanted to use the influence of music to enable people to fulfill their civic duty.
“It’s entirely about the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought why not do the most creative thing possible, like making rap, to solve this problem.
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take much light weight is the Singapore government.
It will spend $1,300 annually to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known as conservativeism by its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why do Singaporens not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Population Office, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities”
“People thus have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to the delaying of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
While there were efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as measures against population declines, this has led to distaste among locals.
On some Singapore websites, undisclosed xenophobia is seen against many new immigrants, especially those who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s government has recorded its worst electoral outcome since the beginning of independence.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence real estate trade.
The City Development Office began to regulate the number of small apartments known as “crabies from bots” that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and had a great success in sales.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can support a youthful lifestyle and deter developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developer firm EL Developers, claims that their “crabs from shoes” are sold far faster than larger houses.
They are more popular by selling them days to weeks faster than larger-area houses.
Therefore, for our money flow is much better -
However, he admits that the new standards set out clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of the nation, an interview with Singaporens working in the financial district in the city center suggests that they will not have a great effect.
“People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people delay it,” says the young official.
“Let others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about 20 years old, a young man.
Men and women mention career, stress and cost of living and education as a reason to prevent them from having children.
So, whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they are Singaporeans who have the last word about setting up a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal nature or a “area of private life,” which everyone has the right to protect against any disruption.
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico said five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, the concept of privacy was, in a personal sense, a personal name and a password - when it was a social network.
“My biggest secret would not be published,” says Jorge, 10, in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“They’re a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world,” he said.
“I’m taking pictures of FB or how we play.
I also talk to friends there.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, photos of naked persons or photos of crimes, or to write defamatory or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
I created an account on Twitter so I could express my views and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I’m just putting them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask networks, and admits that he doesn’t know 20 people from his friends list.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to this boy, none of them brought him on anything, neither wanted his address or phone number.
“If I was urged or required, I would simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José signed up for Ask after he read the recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying.
A friend was blackmailed on the social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not log out of the account.
It just activated the private regime.
Then it explains a series of steps how to safely set up an account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of those known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
“Of course I would have done it if someone were to bother me or I just wanted to.
“Even if I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents in social networks need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
He states: “The Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed.
Marrielos Porras notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital Natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, “because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature.”
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - considerate, at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences - he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do something, does not work,” he adds.
In addition, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you mark people in the pictures of the celebrations, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: Do everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the internet as well as outside of it.
They're the same rules.
“A person outside the internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles and should be the same on social networks,” he said.
Oversight
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and educational advisor, explains that it is necessary for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand any inaccuracies, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences they may have in setting up an account on the internet.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule - don't talk to strangers -
The South American Summit is over and the Lima Declaration has not been published.
The 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without being issued the Declaration of Lima, which was announced and which was reportedly signed by seven presidents present.
Efe repeatedly attempted to access the document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of state and government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidential offices, who at the beginning determined that the document would be published after the end of the summit, said it would be later published on the website of the Cuban government.
In addition, they said the content was published by President Ollanta Humala in a few short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video was transmitted in the press room from the presidential assembly without sound with a message - a confidential session, the transmission of sound was prevented -
A small amount of information that journalists had at their disposal was provided by press spokespersons of some governments who were present, but not by the Persian spokesperson.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participants in the presidents, which prompted hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the president’s office sent an e-mail to the media with a final statement from the summit, but this is only a statement from President Humala, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Paises Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, even though it was urgently required by the press.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Persian authorities sought to ensure transmissions for all journalists, but completely prevented the supply of information.
The Summit concluded, among other things, with a joint commitment between Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice that resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru President Ollanta Humala and Chile President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin hearing the defence speech of both parties to discuss the dispute that Lima initiated against Santiago.
“We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are hearing today in this international court,” said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,” Piñer added, adding and greeting President Humal by pressing his hand at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice’s decision was published after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court which ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur in 2011 after Fernand Lug’s appeal and did not attend the meeting.
Ollanta Humala, the host president, was tasked with opening the morning speeches and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects between South American countries had been planned to operate with 17 billion dollars in investment.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR member countries would take “important steps towards a South American citizenship target for which residence agreements are extended”
He said actions were supported to improve “cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all parts of South America, and to take common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters.”
“When Europe is in crisis, it does not have an economic consolidation (Latin America) of a winning nature, but it is meant to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future,” Humala said.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between the various locations of South America, especially rural and border areas, so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties,” the president said in a statement.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and the cross-sections of its territory from coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not mention more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped that he would meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday to discuss, with respect, the International Court of Justice’s judgment on the maritime border dispute that is disputed by Bogota.
“It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortea tomorrow,” Santos said.
“We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, or a contract with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country,” he said.
“I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortego to lead the negotiations in the most civilized and respectful form possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
As part of the summit, EU Defence Ministers have pre-agreed to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence of the area.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last countries mentioned are currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn to integrate from Europe
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case, really, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on State TV Peru that Europeans were “killing in World War II” and in other conflicts, “but now there are practically one country”
In this sense, the project advocated the creation of South American citizenship, which the Unasur member countries support.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean community, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back to the past,” he said.
The Ecuadorian president said he agreed to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States will be reduced and those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights will be taken into account.
“Those who are at the forefront never commit themselves to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States,” said Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his \"deep democratic values and human rights\"
He added that, at that time, there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be released to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice who asked him to be questioned in Sweden for an alleged sexual offence, while the own Swedish legislation allows for a videoconferencing call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Correa said there was a risk that Assange would worsen both physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had minor lung problems, but nothing serious,” the Ecuadorian head of state said.
It threatens to worsen its physical and mental state because it is closed in a small space without the possibility of moving on fresh air.
That would mean everyone’s health, he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to asylum provided by Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London to resolve WikiLeaks’ founding.
We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have always been talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings at various European instances,” he said.
He said, “If Britain releases a release tomorrow, everything will end.”
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or over Skype, as the legislation allows without a problem, and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow the problem will be over.
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and made it clear that he definitely did not tolerate - sub-averageity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression -
“We are not the greatest enemies of the free press, we are the bad politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists, nor bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor bourgeoisie, do they control Ecuador, and stated that if he is re-elected, he would continue to make changes in the right way and in the right direction.
President Correa also supported the decision to continue the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership of the Unasur Union until at least her next election and argued that the whole - must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupism covered in legality - because in fact - destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy -
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said he considered it “suitable” the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries now, at the time after the International Court of Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is not currently accepted.
“This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed widely in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward.
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute at the same court as Peru and Chile, and expressed his view that, for Latin America, it is right to search for international instances if both countries commit to adopting a judgment, however hard it may be.
In the context of the possibility of running for a third mandate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador, he noted that he perceived this possibility - with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult -
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but such unfair situations as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility,” he said.
“If I were to win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, I'm going to get the same thing.
I have already decided, he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
“I have just spoken to Venezuela’s vice president Nicolás Madur, who says that President Chavez left for routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a recurrence in the state of health of the president,” he explained.
Today, the head of Ecuador’s state took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Governments of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
“It was as if a flash struck me,” he said, referring to the moment of truth that the doctor was trying to “relieve a little,” but apparently without success.
The boy kept it in front of the family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it, with such an effort that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most ancient patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabriczio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little treatment options, and a larger stigma.
At that time, the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, because he had a cutting wound.
Having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive and live fully with this syndrome.
However, there are a lot of people who don’t know and lose their disease when the virus caused the destruction of the body and sent out the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since AIDS appeared in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, it is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, adding that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication this year.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that the researchers concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that survival and life expectancy depend on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, better for those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
In simple terms, this means that those diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can live without problems, according to these findings, up to 75 years of age,” the doctor explained.
To highlight this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of the Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, and in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS-UNAIDS Joint Programme), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS.
In 2011 alone, 255 people died in Jalisco, and until this May 187, however, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are people still dying of the consequences of the disease?
-\"It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the supply of drugs. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage, because they do not know the condition of the infection, i.e. at the late stage of the disease -
It adds a convincing indication: ‘Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already manifested. All we need to do to make more impact on overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore, on a large scale, it is necessary to offer tests to detect the disease to all those who ask for it.’
In his proposal, he coincides with specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco, and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to take tests to a private laboratory just because his friend did so, and despite his low age, he had already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer disease that is one of the usual complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
“If I’m going to die, I’d rather have three times a week,” they say, but that’s not my case.
The change was for better, healthy eating, exercise, taking medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person,” says Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the Milenio JALISCO daily to motivate those who are afraid of today as part of World AIDS.
If they risked, let them know if they are HIV positive as soon as possible, and if they have already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they are responsible.
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big abyss, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guatemalan journalist who discovers information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In the places that are engaged in this task, they have actually increased the distribution of condoms, they have previously given us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms, he said.
The most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
“What you want” is a common question of irony and judgment from social workers, school counsellors, pharmacies and healthcare staff who want to avoid, the reporter says.
He suggested that this ineffective distribution be changed. Let the condoms not just behind the countertops, but the hundred be in dispensers in public toilets, in places where the young often go.
“It’s not promiscuity support.
It’s not even about paying beer and motels, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to divide condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex life,” he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco
There have been 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This condition marks fourth place in Mexico in new and identified cases of AIDS and 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the disease is sexually transmitted, 6% of the blood pathway y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people who do not know about the disease in one registered case.
A judgment approved by the U.S. Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the debt restructuring of Grupo Vitro established by the bankruptcy in Mexico, raises a bleak precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and the solvency problem.
Thus, it seems that the restructuring procedures of companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Hal at the North Texas bankruptcy court leaves in practice a Mexican firm without defense against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States of America with appeals against three irregularities.
It should be said that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the US insolvency law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure provides for insolvency proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, which is determined by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the voting of branches from the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of restructuring would not be achieved.
However, the Mexican law allows this possibility.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, under whose internal debt the Federal Bank of bankruptcy was held.
In addition, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branches, creditors - who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. funds of \"suppliers\" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation faced since 2008 - against the background of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company Gonzáleze Sady will appeal for a new assessment directly at the appeal court, so that the assessment takes place in full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because only three were initially voted.
If he fails here, he will require, as a remedy, a revision of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is serious that the court has neglected a document sent by the Mexican government as a unit of amicus curiae, in which a detailed description is given to Vitro’s practice under the Bankruptcy Act, and in which it points out that the company has facilitated itself by resorting to agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has subordinated to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, rules designed for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
The impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall Ratings
Unnoticedly, several months of criminal notification by the Mexican Air Force unions against former owner Gaston Azcarrag Andradem, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, had already flown over the vessel, according to the trade union pilots.
We are in charge of Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructing justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which the Bank IXE of Fideicomis F/589 selected a pesos on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were likely to be directed towards the purchase of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Professional de Hotels).
As is known, Azcarraga Andrade is a majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Marta
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens gathered on weekends to prevent the opening of China’s Dragon Marta in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge shopping and distribution center with products from “a land with a large wall” focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a living area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, Canacintra (Camara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the south-east zone to oppose a monumental complex that would partly destroy the protected area and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of matter with ACTA document
The request from the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which requested an explanation of under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to the Anti-Forgery Trade Agreement (ACTA) signed in Japan, known under the English abbreviation, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), remained up-to-date.
As is known, it happened, despite the fact that the Senate itself excluded the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the Long Term

Investing in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hetin: Basketball was my life.
Basketball world champion Héctor-Hetin-Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and has been working through the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor-Hetin-Reyes.
Reyes had been on the wheel chair for over 60 years, whether as a junior player, BSN national basketball league player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation, before he was caught up in 2008.
“I held many roles in basketball during my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the National League BSN in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and chairman of the Federation,” Reyes told reporters of Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel for more than 50 years, his faithful wife.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes is not exaggerating in his statement.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenir objects from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest motivation of all guarding those who commemorate his activity in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
“It’s been my best years, I’ve enjoyed it the most because I’ve had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with the team since 1967, whether as an owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when JEROM MONCY debuted in BSN.
At that time, the team took over “Cuco” Ortiz, who was an excellent leader,” Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here earlier and worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham at that time, said to me, ‘I have a two-meter-old player for you.
You want him -
And that was the beginning of Minsk, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to play Raymond Gass, who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon victory in the championship, Gaulle will then contribute to the next -
The championship, when he played for the team of Los Vaqueros, enjoyed himself, but only remotely, because in 1988 he had already served as president of the Basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy the coin's location on the national team.
“I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the 1989 Olympics.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we ended up fourth, but we were supposed to have bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throwing,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, when we won gold, and we drove out a team of the United States that was quite similar to the one that blow up our bronze at the World Cup.
The team not only had Minsk, Gaulle, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lópeze and Piculina (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) - Toñito - Colón and James Carter, León's brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario-Quijote - Morales, who couldn't have been on the team in 1990 due to knee injuries.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the 1995 Olympic qualification in Neuquén, Argentina.
With the players on the poupist like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players excluded due to the battle in the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his action in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Portuguese coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julius Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla from young people.
What success do you think is the biggest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, that the boys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory certificates and courses for trainers, arbitration assistants and referee.
That's nice to meet you.
What are you doing now?
I listen most to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was world-renowned by John Ross Ewing, better known as \"J.R\" in the Dallas television series, in which he embodied a man who acted carelessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil magnate J.R. Ewinga in the Dallas television series, became a symbol of lactose in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died on Friday afternoon of cancer-related complications, according to the official family announcement provided by Dallas Warner Bros. to the Associated Press.
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked the most,” his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
“Linda Gray, who was his wife’s representative in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time when he died in Dallas Hospital,” said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who he knew.
“He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest,” Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with livercirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman was transplanted.
Years before the television series Dallas, Hagman became a decent guy in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (Jin), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His action in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman’s master performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. who led him to the stellar summit.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan “Who shot Jejár”, which was supposed to provoke expectations about a piece full of emotions when Hangman’s character was almost murdered, has caused not only a huge number of speculators around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in bookstores.
This also helped this work to achieve a track record.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, watched an average of 41 million TV viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show of history after the end of the 1983 television series MASH, which watched 50 million viewers.
His brother-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) was shot on J.R.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewinga, an insatiable greed with a charismatic smile: a cunning entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to keep his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a treatment room.
“I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: \"Here lies the honest citizen J.R.Ewing.\"
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was “great on the screen and outside of it”
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky to know it and love it.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series aired TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
\"The filming of five parts of the second series has already been completed, and the sixth one has just been filmed,\" the television station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series will continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who lit up in classical works such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, a lawyer Ben Hagman.
At the beginning of the 1950s, Larry tried his luck at the New York theatre scenes, and then in 1952 to 1956 he served in England at the Air Force.
There he met a young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston andheid, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darling: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t put anything in there that I knew might hurt someone or damage him,” the association said at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donations and worked as a volunteer at a hospital where he helped combat patients.
“I like them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then,” he said in 1996.
I'm trying to comfort them in the sense - don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy -
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Start a course that explores the end of the world
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the “long number” of May calendar, which was to come on December 21st, many people caught as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budgetary abyss that some call the “long-term Armstrong” and the growing conflict that Israel is drawn into, a place where, according to Christians, theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When a person discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptic thinking.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses about “the end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, an assistant professor, Barry Vacker, organizes a course: Means, Culture and the End of the World.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
“We are discussing why these thoughts are expanding over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material enters the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I’ve been trying to inform students about what is possible, likely, plausible and impossible,” says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant in art history and anthropology, put together to organize a course with the simple name End of the World.
\"We don't connect - 2012 - because we always count on the possibility to organize the course again if the world doesn't end,\" Restall said.
Despite “threaty destruction”, students must study, create projects and perform final exams.
On Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work - until just until the evening of the anticipated end of the world,\" Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
“He stretched in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students who applied for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received an email asking if there was still a place.
Students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Thus apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wakesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of the hour in which it could be taught,” he said.
\"I enjoy it -
But no student, let alone a professor, said he didn’t believe in the end of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan predictions, and in a certain way we are debunking it,” said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student at the Temple University of West Chester.
“Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar,” Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back several centuries, which people react to changes in their surroundings with forecasts about the end of the world.
The development of these speculations caused the Internet.
“Jinde doesn’t think about it,” he said.
This happens in the vast majority of English speaking worlds.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew there about any course about the “end of the world”, answered quickly.
“Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote and indicated an exception to the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last court had been discussed over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, people would immediately start thinking about the next date - or to philosophy that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period at which the world will disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professionals.
A few have said that they intend to go to the festivals - the end of the world -
“I think I’ll call a couple of friends to laugh together,” said Samir Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
