The members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will be called muppets.
Among some of the members of the National Assembly there was a consternation. This is the result of a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea was created in connection with plans to turn the assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can become the subject of kpin.
One of the Labour Party parliamentarians expressed concerns about his group by saying that the new name is being emboldened with the Welsh words \"twp\" and \"pwp\"
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, the word “twp” means a fool, and the word “pwp” means departures.
One of Plaid Cymru’s politicians said that his group was “dissatisfied with proposals and presented other solutions.”
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was \"open to change names. However, he pointed out that the sound of the word \"MWP\" is very similar to the word \"muppet\"
In this case, the Welsh letter \"in\" is pronounced similarly to the letter \"u\" in the English dialect Yorkshire.
The Committee, which is currently working on a draft law amending the name, took the following position: \"The natural final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to their own -
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, and the transformation of the assembly into the Welsh Parliament gained broad support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the assembly to \"Member of the Welsh Parliament - that is, the WMP in English, although this abbreviation \"MWP - enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
The members of the assembly propose alternative solutions. The difficulties with reaching consensus are a loss for Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, which should present the bill in the coming weeks.
The Act introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules of appealing members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title while discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help bring down the tens of years of dispute with neighboring Greece, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on name change, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to allow you to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St. Marcin’s New York Church are silent in connection with the problems of the church in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There is no trace of them at the moment.
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people are socializing in a different way,” he noted.
“Bars have ceased to be a place for regular meetings of community members.
In the case of churches, he is concerned, however, that the funds derived from the sale of property are not sufficient for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that “they will be at the starting point sooner or later.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartmentmakers inhabited by people who would not support the other surrounding temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be a white race. This will speed up the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a gathering of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcine joined the community a decade later).
The original gathering of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
The surrounding assembly of African-Americans then took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Marcine was taken over by a gathering led by polygamy John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th street vendors (the main trade street in Harlem), who opposed the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The 1939 fire significantly damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s parishes made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a bell band.
The polygamy David Johnson, the son of John Howard Johnson and his successor to St. Marcine’s Church, proudly called the new caralylon “the bell of the poor.”
An expert who hit the bells in July described them in a different way, as “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the world’s first karylon to be supported by black music. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin’s church did not replace him.
In recent months, in the church of St. Marcine there have been a number of complex events involving architects and performers. Some of them were brought to the place by secular church leaders, and some - the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of secular leaders) directed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that \"it wanted to put the cost on board - although the council did not take part in the employment of architects and contractors sent to the site.
Part of the parish also complains of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old diver in California to search for homares
The authorities reported that last Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old diver looking for a smoker in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American town of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he dived with his friends for about half an hour when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends, they came to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
In the beginning, Hammel thought that the boy was excited about the homage, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten.
After reaching the site of the event, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin in the area of the collar.
“I started screaming to everyone to run away from the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The shark species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
At a press conference, Captain Larry Giles said the fish had been noticed a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it was not a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injury to the upper part of the trunk.
In order to conduct an investigation and for safety reasons, authorities for 48 hours closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad, to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's store network plans to expand its operations on the UK cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws gloves to such shops as Boots, Super Drug and Debenhams, bringing cosmetics related to the style of department stores and specially trained retailers to their supermarkets.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is constantly growing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household goods, 11 stores belonging to the network will appear larger racks with cosmetic products. In the event of success of the initiative next year, the activities will be extended to further points.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways to develop space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury’s, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 articles. In the range for the first time, the products of such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its range of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The generality of online sales and the daily purchases of small amounts of food in local shops makes supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that sales points will increasingly resemble commodity homes as the network attempts to combat discounts such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing the sales of food products and the growth of investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was concluded following a conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £ 125 million three years ago.
According to Lloyds reports, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, into four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all the needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the existing ways of making purchases -
Peter Jones, “Worse” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Day TV, was \"wrong\" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the £11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a reconnected collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items called Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a prosperous lifestyle brand and focus on a renewed collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taken by Holly Willoughby, angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “wrong” when a popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his Marlow business empire, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million, he would not have time to devote himself to their brand offering Truly accessories and household articles.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrov by Goop. It was also supposed to double the assets of Holly Willoughby, estimated at £11 million.
Following the announcement of a decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK, going to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “Mark True was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future with her and wanted to deal with her for several decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the activity completely surprised all involved persons.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow warehouse, goods are ready for sale.
Experts believe that giving up this Morning’s presenter and one of the UK’s most successful stars can cost millions of pounds due to significant investments in products, including articles from pillows to clothing and household items, as well as further delaying market entry.
It can also mean the end of long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin had close relationships with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couples spent their holidays together, and Jones included 40% of the stakes in the television production of Dan Baldwin’s company.
Holly Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source similar to Peter Jones said last night: “We won’t comment on his business issues.”
It was a difficult conversation, and then we fell in love with each other.
The president joked about the media criticism caused by the attention that some considered “unadultable husband” as well as a positive relationship with the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a funny voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
\"I didn't give up anything -
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trump a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations have been delayed.
After more than three months since the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see an “analogical response” from the United States to the early actions of North Korea to disarm.
Instead, the United States has maintained sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have great relationships -
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had a positive effect: they led to the completion of missile trials, helped free hostages, and returned the remaining US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave in presidential terms, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, we’d have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing a finger at a crowd gathered right in front of us.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of Lombok residents, the authorities did not announce a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid activities.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international personnel will be able to operate on the site of the event.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international aid should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the shoreline.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, despite the warning, was likely to affect the number of deaths.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, is headed with help for the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure a major point in his campaign and has devoted a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the administration of the president is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure due to the continuing tensions of the religious background in the country. The members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died and tens of thousands of inhabitants lost their roof over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian gangs and Muslims using machetes, bows, shots and other simple weapons on the streets.

“I noticed the upcoming Kante, took the ball, and gave the shot without a deeper thought,” he said.
Chelsea led a 1:0 half match after the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues kicked the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovačić and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful play forward in the criminal field back to Hazard.

Liverpool will face the Napoli club in the Champions League group on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.

Cromwell Monument to the British Parliament the last victim in a dispute about \"writing history again\"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the resembling actions of the Taliban to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick’s proposal as “crazy,” and “trying to write history again.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over Oliver Cromwell’s figure before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of the English Civil Wars, it was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps his forefather Thomas had previously decided to punish not Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell in the monument shows his opinion in the 19th century and that for many people he is still worth commemorating.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “For many people, Cromwell was perceived, perhaps more often in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures.
The assessment, to the extent appropriate, is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.

They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them proper respect,” he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern part of the United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing power by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa blows at almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5 p.m. Eastern time it was awarded a category 1. It was then 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast, on Sunday Rosa will move north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the masses of humid air northward, to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of Mexico.
In the following days, the humid tropical air that comes in contact with the approaching air will cause the easing rainfall in the South West of the United States.
In some places, precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, pollution movements and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause precipitation from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the South West of the United States, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical precipitation, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly reborn to walk around the desert.
Extensive reliefs can change the canyons into rivers, and storms with lightning will cause local gustly winds and dust shifts.
Upcoming before it will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
Rains above 1.3 cm in total are possible, which can cause small movements of pollution and danger on the road.

This can lead to rapid changes in temperature at small distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City and Omaha (Nebraska state) and between St. Louis (Missouri state) and Des Moines (Iowa state), these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, the continuing summer temperatures may rise again.
In large parts of the Central and Eastern United States it is expected to be warm at the beginning of October. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the part of the North East.

More than 20 million people watched Bretta Kavanaugh’s hearings
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations on Thursday hearing a candidate for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman who accused the lawyer of sexual harassment taking place in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to stop the regularly broadcast programs in order to report a sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the accusations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate court that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had put her in a state of indifference and tried to remove her clothes from her during a high school event.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that Friday's TV number was even higher than that of Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of TV stations of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures have yet been available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring visibility among people in workplaces.
The number is similar to the visibility of American football cup competitions or the award of American Film Academy awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose presentations strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest visibility, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
ABC station with 3.26 million spectators was in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.44 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure in Friday’s events.
In the morning, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The whole event was transmitted by CNN station.
“I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have the strength to face so many women,” he said.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued the appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the committee.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events waiting for the vote on Kavanaugh's nomination in front of the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the allegations in the coming week, insisting on a minority of Democrats.
Flake convinced in part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake’s choice was important because Republicans wouldn’t have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations of Bretta Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit

Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked local law enforcement agencies for “working and seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The man grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.

“It’s one of those things we’re constantly afraid of,” Will Wade said.
Ash emitted by volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ash extracted from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center prevented Mexicans from approaching the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center has seen numerous bloatings and shocks.
Photos posted on social media show the front panes of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in the districts of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcano activity 72 km south-east of the country’s capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police launch with Catalan separatists before independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the clashes of protesters supporting Catalonia’s independence with the police’s prevention departments. On this day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme emotions of a referendum on Catalonia’s secession.

After a year since the referendum of October 1st, tension will not weaken. Although the authorities in Madrid considered them illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate the desired Catalan Art Nouveau.
Voters in the vast majority voted for independence, but the attendance was low due to a wide-ranging boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year in brutal clashes with police trying to prevent voting in electoral locations.
On Friday evening, a group of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstrations supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who, together with his wife, took part in the protest of the separatists, said there is no hope of independence from Catalonia.
“Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck at a point without leaving,” he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections last December, the parties supporting Catalonia’s secession have difficulty continuing their actions. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or wait in custody for the process in connection with the role played in the referendum and later announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanist recording a phone protest supporting the police, said the politicians on both sides of the dispute were fuelling the conflict.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his willingness to start next year’s elections to the European Parliament.
“Candging in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after entering the house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a multiple hit by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The event occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British time (BST).
Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, a shot could also be cast from the bow.
Mengi's Gate Provides Livingston's Win over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brings victory to the team
Since this season, the Livingston club has been stunned by Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard only a second failure in his 18 matches as a club coach at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's gate proved to be a winning one, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team under Gerrard's leadership this season remains without winning for a Premiership trip. On Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to whom it will lose eight points.
Earlier, because already on Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston extends the series of victories in its division to six matches. Coach Holt has not experienced a failure since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston has missed several opportunities against undisposed opponents
The team led by Holt should have been running much earlier, as the team's game brought a lot of problems to the Rangers.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot the goal, but failed to score the goal. Then Alan Lithgow did not hit after taking Craig Halket's head.
Hosts allowed Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten rivals during constant fragments of the game.
And that's how the decisive goal fell.
After the Rangers gave way to the free team, Livingston found an opportunity. Declan Galluher and Robinson together created the situation of Menga, who scored a goal from the center of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to push over the defenses of the hosts and did not cause any major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by the Rangers' goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to get into the light of the goal from the next permanent passage to the Livingston.
The Rangers continued the attacks in the Livingston criminal field, but could not exploit the situation. They demanded two penalty shots after Halkett's intervention against the midleton variable and one hand play. However, in both cases, the racers' pretensions were rejected.
\"Fenomenal: Livingston's performance - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from returning to the extraclass. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
The game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although Gerrard’s leadership has great moments for them, they didn’t stick to their standards in the match.
In their game seemed to be missing something: only once managed to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning for Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed responses to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
During Saturday’s breakfast in Berlin (September 29) the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with visits aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks outside its home country.
According to the police, for security reasons, 25 thousand people were blocked from gathering in front of the temple, but the supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, including many Kurds, have also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey’s leader’s policy and the German government’s decision to adopt a policy in the country.
On the contrary, the protests reflect the divisions that the visit to a policy that has been shouted by some Turks living in Germany and recognized as an autocrat by others.

The Metropolitan Police reported that officers were working on identifying a dead man and informing family members.
The roads were closed and bus rides were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penalty Department: Six officers injured as a result of riots
As reported by the authorities, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a prison facility for men with an increased level of security.
The HMP Long Lartin criminal settlements in Worcestershire began on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British time (BST) and continue.
Eight inmates in one of the plant’s wings called for a special unit “Tornado”
The officers on the site suffered minor damage to the face.
A spokesperson for the establishment said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the HMP Long Lartin criminal facility.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our plants. We are convinced that the responsible persons will be transferred to the police and can spend more time in prison -
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the plant’s director had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention teams were called to the plant due to dangerous riots, in which workers were attacked with billard balls.
Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (a possible beneficial impact on drought areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona. This is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. The remains after the hurricane of Rosa move across the desert areas of the South West, creating a threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast on Tuesday, Rosa will go directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rainfall will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storms or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from Arizona’s border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation from 5 to 10 cm. In some regions of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, they can reach up to 15 cm high.
In other desert areas of the South West, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, the rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside of the emergency flooded areas may be relieved by the rainfall accompanying Hurricane Rosa, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where droughts are present.
According to the weather.com portal, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of Arizona’s region is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will first arrive at the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with the force of the hurricane, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. Currently, it is located at a distance of 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurricane encounters cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to the forecast, it will hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flooding threat.
The weather.com portal reported that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-west part of Sonora’s state, precipitations are expected to reach between 7 and 15 cm, although they may reach 25 cm.”
Next, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the north direction of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning, he will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, he will go to the southern part of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is the heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecast, rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods and the movement of pollutants in the desert and mudavins in the mountainous area.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four people arrested in attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of trying to murder a sixteen-year-old woman found with a gloomy wound in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in the town of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, about 4 a.m. British time (BST).
The victim was taken to the hospital and her condition remains “stable.”
Police from Avon and Somerset reported that one seventeen-year-old, two eighteen-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in Radstock.
Officials are asking for contact from all people who have recordings from the event.
Trump says Brett Kavanaugh “has experienced anger and anger,” the Democratic Party.
“The voice cast on Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and turbulent conduct of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “familiar and angry with the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. He strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. A woman claims that a few decades ago, when both were teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified at the hearing on the charges she filed.
On Saturday, President Kavanaugha said: “The Americans could find out about the brilliance, the class and the courage of Kavanaugha.
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, a legal expert on great merits for the community,” he said in a statement.
The president did not refer directly to the nomination of Brittany Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-presidential elections.
“The most important choices in our lives are five weeks apart.
“I’m not running in this election, but I’m very active,” he said.
“I am still fighting to defend our great candidates.
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a policy of “resisting and hindering activities”
According to CNN, one of the assistants of the important policy of the Republican Party, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people died on Saturday, many of which were kidnapped by high waves breaking through the beaches, following a strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival’s city. At dusk, waves reaching up to 6 meters high hit the shore, taking many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When there was a threat yesterday, people on the beach didn’t escape immediately and fell victim to tsunamis,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency for natural disasters, said at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami attacked everything on its way, taking out cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho said.
As he said, some were saved by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
A number of damaged houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water can be seen in the air photos published by the agency for natural disasters.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
A number of earthquakes occurred in the area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy released by the vast Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have increased the effects of tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
Nugroho said death victims and damage could be greater along the shoreline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the communication “was completely paralyzed, so there are no reports from the province of Donggala.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said, adding that employees and volunteers of the organization will go to places affected by the disaster.
“Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may be significantly worsened,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami impact in Palu. However, the authorities said the waves came shortly after the warning was issued.
On an amateur video made available on social media, you can see a man screaming out of the building trying to warn about the upcoming tsunami of a person on the street.
Within a few minutes, the wall of water broke by the shore, taking down buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused significant failures in power supply, preventing communication within the Palais. This, in turn, made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the military began sending transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic articles of first need.
The airport located in the city is open exclusively for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit centers for people evacuated in Palu.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseb T. Sinai, the National Director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from Donggala province to the city of Palu and found shelter in tents from the bress set on the courtyard of the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly starting to assist, there have been criticisms that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience are preventing their journey to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“We are officially still facing a regional disaster,” the spokesperson for the Red Cross said.
“When the government recognizes that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid.
After two days of a Friday earthquake and a tsunami in Pala, friends and families of missing people continue to live the hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliding men who participated this month in the Indonesian Asian Games.
As Peter Mandaga said, other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono reported how, within hours of the arrival of paragliding communities, Roa Roa desperacko sent messages by WhatsApp communicator to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of blue-colored hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing cash at an ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping mall
According to a statement from the Newport Police Command, on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 to a Brink employee who added cash at a ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping mall.
“The carmaker emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to complete the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man “dried from the back to the employee of Brink,” and stole a money bag for the ATM.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify how many people involved in the theft.
All persons with information about the identity of thieves are asked to contact the Newport Police Command at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “A person previously known as Kanye West.”
The 40-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time now. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before visiting Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album, Yandhi, during his performance.
He will replace Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, resigned from the program for \"emotional reasons\"
The West has previously stated that the word \"Ye\" is not only an abbreviation from its present artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
“It seems to me that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures, it means “You”,” said West in the earlier period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter about the pseudonym Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I'm Ye - I'm a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are.
West was among the other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West co-worker, also saved his pseudonym in various ways, with a connection, without a connector and in capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Defendor pledges not to use army against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has pledged never to use an army against civilians.
On Saturday in the Square of Three Cultures, López Obrador promised to “never use the army to repress the Mexican people”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The event occurred at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial assistance to learners as well as creating more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee says, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, along with the rise in China’s activity in this area, the United States should double its research spending in the field of AI.
This is related to the AI announcements published by various U.S. government agencies, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Last year, China presented its plan to become the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“For starters, we need to double the AI research budget: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, CNBC also said that doubled funds could double the chances of another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Sinovation Ventures. The company has invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that defeated the best American player in Othello at the time. He then held a leadership position in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of earlier U.S. government technology initiatives, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defense Area (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked the question about the deadline for the next edition of the struggles, because according to him it would help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often need to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It is not China that receives the best representatives of academic environments, but corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of the AI.
“I believe that people dealing with artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctoral degree should automatically admit a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence of the next generation.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the U.S. National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations granting funds to U.S. scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from the world of industry and science, while the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion commitment to the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 billion a year in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to create a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has not shrunk one step ahead for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocks the country’s efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and thus vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on naming, but the nationalists said the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign to encourage boycott raised doubts as to whether the attendance would reach a minimum level of 50% required to recognize the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia, one of the countries created after Yugoslavia's fall, to such organizations as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will ensure more security for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of members of Parliament.
The state electoral commission said no unusual events had been reported by 13am.
However, the turnout at this time was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections.
“I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old Tanewski osses, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the name of the country to open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set chairs in front of tents spread by boycotters of the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with their head, not their back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaew says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will speak for a name change in the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaew said.
He said the vote “yes” is a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Research, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in a referendum.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV, Telma TV plans to vote 57% of respondents on Sunday.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to end successfully, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
The referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since the adoption of power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeats all of Brighton’s defenses and wins the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton defenses home on Saturday, ending with 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The gate gained by Aguera in 65 minutes looked child-friendly.
The action began with the introduction into the middle of the field to the Argentine assailant.
The footballer overtook three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
He first played one of them and then crossed the others and was on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in a criminal field, which defeated the goalkeeper of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is struggling with foot trauma,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at the time.
However, Sterling gave the Blues the first lead in a duel in the Premier League.
The gate in question fell in the 29th minute.
In the action, Aguero got a ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful feed along the left side of the field to the Monroe Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move on to the far poles.
Manchester City's attacker directed the ball to the net just before it fell on the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will be held at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the chances of winning Rockies
After losing a chance to play-off by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he did not have to perform in the first lineup.
However, Scherzer hopes to be in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies if only Rockies retains the chances of playing in the playoffs phase. Currently, the team has one more victory than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against the Nationals as a result of 5:2. However, they still want to win their first title of Division Champion.
“Despite playing ‘about nothing’, at least we’ll be out on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the opponents’ performance will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to attend this meeting?
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for a Sunday meeting. However, the team tends to expose Scherzer in the first composition.
This would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth performance in the first lineup. The player took part in Thursday's throwout training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The team’s right-hand blower from Washington records the results of 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the batters and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not refer directly to his appointment as a Supreme Court judge by discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the mid-presidential elections.
“In November, we put all the achievements we’ve achieved so far.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided by five weeks.
Although I am not starting, I remain very active. I am constantly defending our wonderful candidates,” he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to take over power by all means possible. They are obscene and malicious.
They don’t care who they hurt and who they need to hurt to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal. But we won’t give it back to them.
“Democrats carry out the mission of “standing resistance and hindering activity”
“It has been very well seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, malicious, unpleasant and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate committee of the judiciary, citing the name and surname of the U.S. Senator of the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, which met with a loud buzz from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the document leak?
\"Uh, listen?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people expressing their own opinions
When the activists of Momentum in my party voted to give me a naked vote, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of Members of the Labour Party who have recently been told that they are not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for nagany was due to the difference between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences were about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In a statement on Friday on the meeting of Labour Parliamentaries from Nottingham East, it was possible to read: \"We want the meetings to be open and productive -
For eight years, I have served as a Labour Party Member, most of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are going differently at the moment. A long time ago, the promise of a \"serious and milder\" policy was forgotten, as long as it was ever remembered.
It is becoming more and more obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party. Each opinion is evaluated for compliance with the management of the party.
It all started soon after Jeremy Corbyn’s position as president. The colleagues, in whom I thought we had similar views, started to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not have agreed with before. They concerned issues such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech, regardless of the content, I meet on social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemnation of centrism, or leaving the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments at my address are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with insulting others.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With each request for \"the content of distrust - and every change in the rules of choosing the worldview of the party is narrowed down.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to bow down and silence certain issues.
That’s not why I took care of politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, which led to the breakdown of my school class, I have been trying to take care of the better quality of public services for those in need - both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I have never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences of views with the party's authorities.
I would like to say to those who supported Friday’s proposal that I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour president in the face of an upcoming Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I believe that no threats of withdrawal of nominations or advisory political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 - Undefeated Ayr Again
But there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the Scottish extraliga.
The team came first in the table and remains the only unbeatable team.
In the end, this distinguished defense and better use of opportunity led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could have been pleased with his supporters.
“The previous matches have been a challenge for us, but we’re still unbeatable, so I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “We must respect Ayr’s players. They’ve taken advantage of the opportunities that we’ve had,” he said.
Ayr went on to lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson was placed and Frazier Clim was raised. However, a yellow card for Rocky Hughes's school, who came to the band from Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the result when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to raise.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr after digging from the penalty shot just before the end of the first half. He first gained the grip and later took advantage of the opportunity to raise, obtaining a 17:5 result for Ayr.
Melrose began the second half well, with Patrick Anderson’s placement increased by Baggoto reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer suspension of the game due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the pitch on his nose. After the resumption of Ayr, he increased the lead after placing Stafford McDowall and raising Clim.
Ayr Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose re-used his number: an attempt to raise Bruce Colvin with an unused attempt to lower the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for collapsing Clima without a ball. MacPherson gained a grip on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the opportunity to raise. Then he managed to increase the score just after the game was resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the penalty shot and enabled the winged Gregory Henry to get the fifth app for the hosts.
Still Game Star Begins Careers in the Gastronomy Industry
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems to be starting his business in the gastronomy industry. Recently, he was discovered to be the director of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC sitcom and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the story of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after leaving “Craiglang”
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although the Scottish Sun intelligence suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in “a growing gastronomy industry” in Glasgow.
\"The sea belongs to us -: without access to the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Navy patrols around the Navy base in La Paz.
There are blue flags from public buildings.
In the ports of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, there is the following motto: “The sea is ours by law.
Its recovery is our duty.
In the unavailable sea of Bolivia, the memory of the shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict about the resources of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the largest for several decades. Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be delivered on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“The works of Bolivia are gaining momentum. The residents are unanimity, optimistically oriented and rely on a favorable verdict,” said diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching a meeting of the International Court of Justice together. They hope that the Hague-based organization will recognise the claim of Bolivia and, after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to negotiate for independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will come to a controversial fight for re-election next year, also hopes for a Monday ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, argue that the chances of a favourable decision for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile, and has also reserved that it will not affect the establishment of possible talks.
As Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law specialist, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments.
Unfortunately, the last four years of Bolivia could have taken the country away from the target.
“The question of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivia administration,” said Paz Zarate.
Morales’ persistent rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any remains of good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors for both countries since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the former president and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree with the opinion that the court’s decision-making process was extremely fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a “exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end a 139-year period of disputes with a reference to mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the subject of access to the sea as an element of political play.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The judgment is a great opportunity to believe that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korean officials say nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises at the Singapore Summit among the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seemed to be on the verge of resumption of suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri claims that “the freezer is as if the lack of abolition of sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration ending the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without Pyongyang taking specific disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is universal skepticism as to the fact that Pyongyang seriously approaches the liquidation of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of guaranteeing security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows announce the appearance of the latest line of big head coverings in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover yourself in front of the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, extra-dimensional head coverings consisting of their 2019 summer collection that dazzled with style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
The unusually impractical hats peaked on Instagram this summer. These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino’s distinguished work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, penthouse ronde that flooded the model’s head.
Other extra-dimensional accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even an pineapple -- but they weren't designed to heat their heads.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks - in the very same time on Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and resembled the style of Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and another looked like a melt ice cream.
And if you don't want to break with great fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
Non-dimensional hats follow just the \"La Bomba - a straw hat with a 61 cm wide ronde, which was already worn by everyone - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which was spilled through social media, presented another great creation on the run - a straw beach bag almost as large as a model dressed in a bathing suit.
The burnt orange rim bag, finished with rafia frets and crowned with a white leather hand, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Luke Armitage, star stylist, told FEMAIL: “I am surprised that large hats and beach bags will appear in stores next summer - because the designer managed to exert such a great influence, it would be difficult not to use the demand for oversized accessories -
John Edward: Language Skills Required for the Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements - in 2018 they could boast of further outstanding exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social activities.
Featured by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland strive to provide the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career pathways and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another person in a language that he understands, then it comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it comes to his heart.
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages take the first place in league rankings, with the highest rates of distance for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher rating of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS Member Schools showed that 72% of students received a higher A rating in Mandarin, and 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners, and 63% of Spanish learners also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, learning languages as elective subjects is conducted in the same scope as learning STEM subjects (street sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) as part of teaching programs in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK) found that the lack of language skills of candidates was responsible for the difficulty of employing jobs by employers.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for starting a career.
These skills are essential in a globalized world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong skills, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, regardless of the chosen career path.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, which involved more than 4,000 UK adults, 75% of them couldn’t speak a foreign language well enough to talk, and the French language was the only language whose percentage of two-digit speakers, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding the right employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages recognized as the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a teaching environment that will prepare children and arm them into the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future is preparing for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as \"International communication skills\"
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just how it's supposed to be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut on Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans who wanted to see LeBron James’ debut in Los Angeles Lakers finally got to see them.
Luke Walton, Lakers' coach, announced that LeBron James will play in a Sunday's pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, but less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers team reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After the training that took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to take part in pre-season matches to get ready,” he said.
So election Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of electoral events in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump-planned electoral parties to be held next week, along with positions in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his election to hold a free seat in the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming elections on the semi-government, as Republicans may be at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
At what time will the election Trump in West Virginia take place tonight and where will you watch it online?
Trump’s election in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7 p.m., i.e. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Thus, the election Trump in West Virginia will be able to follow live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearings of a candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour, as well as the expected vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum of one week, at the time of the FBI’s investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral parties is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign with five sentences next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“The control of Congress is such an important point in the President’s schedule that, as the campaign’s hottest season approaches, it will visit as many states as possible,” Trump’s campaign spokesman, who did not give permission to give his name, Reuters, said in a statement.
Today's election at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh\" - West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 - for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia candidate to the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team of the United States shows the spirit of struggle, keeping hope for victory in Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The rocking swing of momentum is a completely invented sports concept, but one in which the players really believe, and already the most in such competitions as these.
So what does their momentum look like at this moment?
“They’ve run six points, and now they’re only running four, so I think we’re having a little momentum,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, leads to four points, while there are still twelve points to win.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have decent patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of winning three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Screaming at the whole bullet, which was a sign of excitement, became louder during his round, sinking the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas won two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with the result of 15, was met with a similar cry - one that gives them the understanding that the American team is still in the game.
“It’s enough to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple of European teams won four out of four and was not wrong.
\"Moliwood is the only couple who didn't count bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players must be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential victory of the European team at Le Golf National.
It would be best to play at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of fourball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and double double on the nine front dug Spanish and Swedes into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy might change in one moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has a clash to fight in which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes running on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with the result of 10-6 Saturday Fourball and Foursome matches with the United States.
Inspired by the duet, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he admitted the lager, taking two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing his previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a small American team in the morning format of fourball, winning a series with a score of 3-1.
The United States had more resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches, but they could not make losses.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points from the 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari (the band was named \"Molliwood - after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the format of fourball in a wonderful style, they defeated the decomposed Woods and the American debuter Bryson Dechambeau, getting an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who was tired of two Saturday games, occasionally showed a glamour of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats so far, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, not participating in the morning football format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to defeat the result of the 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopeka, respectively, the world ranking positions 1 and 3.
However, not everything went to the European team to think of this pleasant, cool day in the field set to the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for Americans on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format, and they returned later to defeat Poulter and Roy McIlroy with a result of 4&3 in foursome, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history did the band make a four-point loss, starting with singles, although Furyka's team would only need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, the Sunday counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says, “No one-sided disarmament without trust.
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday during a speech at the UN that the lack of sanctions only deepens North Korea’s lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way the country will unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken \"significant measures of goodwill last year - such as halting nuclear and missile tests, disassembly of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any specific response from the United States,” he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances there is no unilateral disarmament of North Korea.\"
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington’s refusal to “degree” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, his statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as was the case in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the U.S. President-in-Office and the leader of North Korea, which took place on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" and Trump promised North Korea's security guarantees.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (from 1950 to 953), but the U.S. representative said Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also supported calls to mitigate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even objecting to the signing of the “declaration of the end of war,” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can put us on our knees is the frills of people who behave against us ignorantly.
The problem, however, is that the lack of sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was discussed at the beginning of the week by the U.S. leader at the U.N. Forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were a party to denuclearization, not the United States, then there was no such impassion in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
Mim this, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different compared to last year when he said during the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles in the United States is inevitable after Mr Evil President Trump called Kim Jong Una “rocket man” (man of the rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump Forum, which threatened to “total destruction” North Korea last year, Kim Jong Un praised him for his courage to take action to disarm, but he also said there was still a lot of work to be done, and he also said that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time interval for this, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday on the UN Security Council’s forum that: “The enforcement of the UN Security Council’s sanctions must continue and be constant until we establish full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, trying to suppress funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month as part of the preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress was made, and in a few hours North Korea condemned him for \"putting gangster's demands\"
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would demolish a missile testing site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “adequate measures”
He said Kim Jong Un had told him that “the appropriate measures he cares about are security guarantees Trump has committed to in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on long-term rest
The new Harvard University course, which took place this year, provided all the students with more sleep, which was aimed at combating the growing culture of macho, consisting in learning by “the all-night students driven by caffeine.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired by his speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
“After the speech, one girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I told this only now that I’m in my last year of study?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep-related habits help to achieve good results in science and sport, as well as improve the general well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health, said the course was decided to introduce after it was found that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in an academic room where students click cups for coffee, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know what health effects cigarette smoking brings,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students is an increasing problem of lack of sleep.
“Providing enough sleep of good quality should be a secret weapon - students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even allowing them to avoid gaining weight because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry,” he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop a course after taking part in some of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a course for the whole campus.
The next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler told students to set an alarm resembling when to go to bed and when to get up, and also to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light,” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can blur the period rhythm and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga arranges Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during the battle to go to Livingston, when Dolly Menga, with his shot, led to the defeat of Steven Gerrard's disassembled band, obtaining a score of 1-0.
The team at the Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory since the February 4-1 victory over St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt won Gerrard in 18 matches for the second time, giving his team a difference of eight points against the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership - Hearts.
Menga shot the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the composition of the Rangers showing lack of commitment did not look to improve.
While Rangers recorded a fall in sixth place, Livingston climbs to third - just behind the Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers' team may have further trouble with the need to provide a head wound to the linear judge, Calum Spence, after he was hit by an object thrown out of the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed Ayr to overtake and go to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went through the same eleven Livingston, who took the Hearts point last week, being a delighted way in which his well-trained team tortured at every step of his opponents.
The Rangers may and have dominated having a ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes when Menga’s first roll allowed Scott Pittman to face the goal of Allan McGregor, but the assistant didn’t take advantage of his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who played as defender, could only remain in the back position.
Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly decided that he belonged to a penalty strike fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson disbanded the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were able to give only two customs shots in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely worried about the head of Lassana Coulibala and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While the goal that Livingston won in the 34-minute goal could have been the opposite of the game, no one can deny that they deserved him for the effort he made in his acquisition.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs’ deep constant gameplay.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Dallas threw the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept quiet, giving Menga a simple finish to finish the action.
Gerrard didn’t stop and mention Coulibally as Ryan Kent, and the switch made an immediate impact on the winger who threw the ball into Morelos, but Kelly’s impressive one managed to block it, reaching from his position.
The Livingston team continued to draw guests into the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long submissions one after another.
Holt's team may have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor turned well in front of Jacobs, after which Lithgow left the game from the corner.
The Rangers' Reserve, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for a penalty throw when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes on again.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page from our release \"Sunday Morning - Almanac: 30 September 1882 - 136 years ago... the day in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm \"Hans - Geiger was born.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactiveity, which ultimately led to the creation of a device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger’s numerator has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” where seemingly unlikely Cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appeared:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.
Evans: “Now you hear something.”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to \"see\" hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to \"see and destroy hostile cells\"
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells as part of the treatment.
This method is to separate the immune cells from the patient and change them into the laboratory.
Then they can \"see\" a protein common to many cancers, and then they are injected into the body again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
In one woman treated with a vaccine learning how to recognize the immune system, hostile cells have been observed to have ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the immune cells from the patient, change them into the laboratory, so that they can \"see\" a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject the patient to these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is very well negotiated,”
HER2 “propels the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon,” explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach is to take immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to locate cancer cells worked to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live, with the MAGA cap on its head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was \"explored\" during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would apply for office in 2020.
Following the performance of his third song, Ghost Town, during which he had a hat with the inscription “Make America Great”, he conducted a statement against Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“How many times do I talk to white people, I hear: “How can you like Trump?
“If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a jump with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony filed before the Senate’s judicial commission on sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he wasn't broadcast, West's video was sent to social media by comicist Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems behind the scenes with his hat.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They got on me!
And then they say I have no choice,\" said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You say I don’t have a choice,” adding, “I’m going to set up a supermen’s cape, so you won’t be able to tell me what to do.
Let's accept -
His words twice provoked “snacking the audience,” and members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, reports Variety. The person who was in the studio during these events: “In the studio there was a grave silence”
West was invited to the show by Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many by making the song I Love it in the alternating bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted the following: “To one of the bravest: Thank you for taking the MAFIA.
Leading talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter said West was simply “he was himself and it’s absolutely great.”
“However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying her music or clothes or supporting her “art”, which I think accepts and spreads a harmful ideology to my community.
He's free.
We are free too, she added.
Before the rapper, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he had already \"formally called Kanye West.\"
However, he is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol, and then an artist known previously as Prince.
Attempts to kill a knife-snacking scene in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with trying to kill him after he sliding a man knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to stand before Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Star Game of Throne Kit Harington moving the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the Medieval HBO series \"Game of Thrones\"
The 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play hards to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he was “sough sure” about this issue.
\"I personally feel pretty confident at this point - where we made a mistake on the subject of masculinity,\" he said.
“What we taught men while they were growing up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are facing right now,” he said.
Kit believes that TV can be partly responsible for developing toxic masculinity due to the appearance of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate and what are learned?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, what makes young boys start to think that they have to stand on a specific side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time - what can we do to change it?
It is clear that everything is not right with young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the end of the series in the following year, saying that he “completed with the fields of battles and horses.”
From November, Kit will play “True West,” Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered knowing his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him in the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this award-winning Emmy fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, an object of love interest for the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has seen a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected by this problem, according to health professionals in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by gender, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus was almost completely reduced, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to one year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is common.
Given the country’s conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease are due to insufficient safeguards in having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team's members would reveal the Republicans' Senators' data - these are \"hazardous lies\" - and \"conspiracy theory\"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the House of Representatives of the United States, rejected allegations that a member of her team would post the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the aforementioned legislators.
A Los Angeles Democratic Party member has assured that these accusations have been brought out by experts and websites linked to “ultra-right wings”
“True lies, lies, and even more wicked lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The public information contained home addresses and U.S. senators' phone numbers, Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual offences against the Supreme Court nominated for it, Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape took place some time after Kavanaugh’s candidacy was challenged by three senators.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was linked to Waters and published information about the Waters team member, Hill reports.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and it’s a 100 percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false, and it is a 100 percent lie.
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman.
“This is a bad way of denying,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that it does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he can't be bad.
He can't provoke.
He cannot challenge the motives of the person who is accused.
For this he must remain calm -
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, Republican candidate for mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent accusations.”
“The perpetrators will be exposed and held accountable for all their actions that pose a threat to any of my team members,” she said.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut, a spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with the British thread has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the series of action films and comedy \"Johnny English - which began in 2003 with the film \"Johnny English -\" and which returned to the cinema screens in 2011 with the film \"Johnny English: Reactivation\"
Will the self-smiling satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export commodity?
In any case, the ever-surprising, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has been re-licensed as his name and name more than anything else signals that he is an extensive, comical product designed for non-English-speaking audiences.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange tastes for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasia Beani and a drop of this guy adding one note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 opening ceremony of the Olympics in London.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world man-mystery - Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series, there is one or two moments worth noting.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, being dressed in medieval armor, while rhythmically hitting the rotor blades about his helmet.
On the screen, you can clearly see Atkinson’s gift to the physical play of comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low flights and unnecessary, especially since now also “serious” film brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem rather to be directed at children than adults - in my opinion Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as imaginative and consistent as the gagas in Atkinson's silent films about Jasio Beana.
The current assumption has always been that the UK has serious problems.
Cyberhaker penetrates a British super secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field to the horror of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the magic of the Prime Minister, who is a pompous, wasted figure already and so suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, embracing herself as Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that she will have to return to one of the retired agents due to the identity of all active spies.
And that means Johnny English in his own person, now employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent - a few nice gags while giving English spy lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for a check-in, reconnecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with a submarine commander, a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin parties in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve the UK’s computer problems, which is the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters, they set the French restaurant on fire; they introduce chaos, sifting on the deck of a luxury Volta yacht; and English sows havoc while using a virtual reality kit to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
In this last sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite the nice and loud performance, the whole film very much resembles television for children.
Typical diameter.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn’t resist thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really match his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it will develop a plan that provides for a four-day working week for the British, for which they will receive a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company’s bosses to hand over savings to employees through the AI revolution, giving them an additional day off.
Thanks to this, employees could enjoy the three-day weekend, obtaining the same amount of remuneration.
The sources say that this idea will “enter into the economic program of the party and plans to leave the country to the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way of using workers to change the economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party in an interview with The Sunday Times said: “It is expected that a policy change will take place before the end of this year.
“This will not happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the employee as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea: the Green Party committed to introducing a four-day working week during the 2017 electoral campaign.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: \"The international working week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it -
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from \"faceless directors -- and \"speculators\" -- in public utility companies.
The plans of the Chancellor from the shadow office also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share, because the Labour Party government could make “deductions” based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in company management and create integration ownership funds in order to donate 10 percent of private sector equity to employees who receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy respond in 60 minutes to the question of whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mindset.
The FBI investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and caused the question to arise whether the findings of the investigation office could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, an interview with the 60 Minutes program, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover something that could lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“Going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the charge came, and I said, \"You did it.\"
He was strong, strong and clear.
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
“I’ve made a decision about Bretta Kavanaugh and a strong allegation is needed to change it,” he said.
“Doctor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people who said it could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change -
What is the Global Citizen Festival event and did it contribute to reducing poverty to any degree?
The Global Citizen Festival will take place next Saturday in New York City, with an annual musical event that boasts an impressive composition of stars and an equally impressive mission to eliminate poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of this event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powerty Project, an international group of activists to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone or other significant actions to help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen have in the 12 years remaining to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action or another case of so-called “clickivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or by posting a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million “actions” since 2011, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also claims that these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, which already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The Group estimates that the secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor partnership and executives involved in “helping children achieve their full potential”, which promised to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after members of Global Citizen sent over 4700 tweets.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition come to history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after carrying out more than 5,000 activities calling for the UK to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which was “How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated”,
Global Citizen replied: “This will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the former great civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars present this year in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to \"block the Russian energy exports\"
Washington may, if necessary, flee to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from inflowing into markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner, revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is the desire to broker energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, through its Navy, has the opportunity to make sure that the sea routes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is about to use and replace fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “bitch known for one trick” with a fuel-dependent economy.
These statements emerged when the Trump administration continues its mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “slave-Moscow.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is expected to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an economy-only project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the implementation of this project is solely due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a violent reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to not interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections she would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and it’s also about women who hold the highest position,” Hill said.
\"After November 6th, I will consider my candidate as president -
At the meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump as saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think they should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option “probably,” said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for the former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidate, and 48 percent opposed him.
Other known names from the democratic camp were taken into account in relation to the potential candidate in 2020, they were Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Berne Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) of Track Palin during the Donald Trump election party
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after moving into the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, which he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers are returning,” Trump told a election party in the city of Tulsa in Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest \"the taboo theme - then she said about her son and other war veterans: \"They return a little changed, they return hardened, they return, wondering if respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other members of the army gave their country -
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, inciting false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of arms in an inexorable state, according to a spokesperson for the Wasilli Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge for a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts have filed a letter of amicus curiæ in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker struggling with this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the lawsuit in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal politics, was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his brutal sons of the gang were abusing her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors of the above-mentioned state-supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"ignores the state, federal and international law for decades -
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the letter reads.
The prosecutors further argued in a letter that the policy refusing immigrants entry was harmful to the U.S. economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and \"set the necessary labour force\"
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear against racial, religious, national or because of belonging to a particular social group or who have such and not other political beliefs,” Sessiones said in a statement on asylum policy on June 11.
Asyl never intended to solve all the problems - even the serious ones - with which people from all over the world are facing every day.
Desperate rescue trials in Palu in a situation where the number of deaths doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Ris Kusum’s 35-year-old mother, comforting her bitter son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance imports bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for water-filled things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some wounded people, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractures in the spine and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes, as he said of the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save myself.
I think I was pushed into the wall room,\" Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and then her voice silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “traping” propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in the American daily that praised the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, accused China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections that will take place on 6 November, China denying the allegation.
Trump’s statement that Beijing tried to interfere with the US election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters that this was a new step in escalating Washington’s campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating trade wars that have led to increased tariffs on mutual imports.
“China’s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump,” Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former state governor of Iowa’s state-leading exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was harming U.S. workers, farmers, and businessmen.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China “now with double force begins to harass, placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China’s government enjoys a recognized American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no votes of opposition in the kiosk on the street in Beijing and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about China’s disturbing economic direction, given that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that “one of China’s most well-known newspapers refused to publish it, even though he didn’t say which newspaper.
Republicans betray themselves against mid-term elections of women with right to vote through Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and defend nominated for the Supreme Court of Brittany Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that your members will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent response, especially from women.
Emotions accompanying this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already want to vote.
“This cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether the efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizon) to conduct an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
\"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and they won't forget it by November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group, a Washington newspaper said.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan, “A November is coming, demonstrating in the Senate lobby the decision by Republicans to control the Judicial Commission on not withdrawing Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony,” Mic said.
“The bias of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,” said one of the news pages of Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, and it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among the undecided women from the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it would be met with a violent response.
“The Republican Party must deal with a small mess,” said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee President, NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting on the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, the U.S.’s Director of Priorities, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided into who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly greater support for the latter.
YouGov’s new survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford’s testimonies, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied while making a statement, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI has launched an investigation into allegations of allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that nominated for the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the time of study at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform - Solid - owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that Inrupt’s goal was to “dominate the world”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
\"The historic moment -
The app uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own “webstore with personal data,” or otherwise POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of things to do, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of the online store with personal data is that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal power through data”
According to the company’s president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes, and the right skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don’t talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down from day to day.
“We don’t ask them permission.
On Saturday, Berners-Lee’s Medium Mail platform wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built based on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has shared a lot in the debate on net neutrality.
Introducing Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to think about the next era in the development of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Reward of the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only cleric Church of England, who during World War I as a combatant was awarded the Cross of Victoria, was celebrated 100 years later in his family city.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918 for attacking Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a stone commemorating the Rushden Parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly on the centenary of his grandfather’s award had “an exceptionally symbolic character.”
According to the London Newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his Battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin \"in a very dense fog and under strong fire from the field and machine guns --
He then hurried to the line of fire and with \"the greatest courage - he led it forward, then alone he admitted an attack on the position of the field departments, devastationing three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to cope with, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vanne, he made a wreath after the completion of a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very proud to take part in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people.”
The MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine you didn’t sleep all night to watch Bellator 206’s turbulent emotions and ultimately can’t see the main battle.
The San Jose gala program contained 13 battles, including six on the main tab, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to fight, the audiences in the UK were shocked by the program’s change to the Pig of Peppa.
Some were disappointed after they didn’t sleep until early morning hours specifically to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the conversion to a children’s cartoon as “some sick joke.”
“In accordance with the government’s regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate so that it can be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
\"Peppa, yes.
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they would work out a schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think of a repeat of the situation, I think we can fix it,” said Coker.
“But it’s Sunday morning six, so we won’t be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were filled with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical fault.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise that this situation will not happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six - that is, to the standard amount. We too strongly wanted to please the fans and unfortunately we overwhelmed.
This is an unfortunate situation -
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels worse because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Discs program, Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that he would become a parent, making him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual conductor of this program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
As he appeared on the show for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that growing up felt “less valuable than others, because “the contemporary love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said: “To this day, this feeling of less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was “ Something worth not to disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexuality.”
The double-brown Olympic medalist became a loud LGBT community activist and used his performance at this year’s United Nations Games in Australia to appeal to a greater number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy, able to live openly, without any implications, and thus wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustine Lance Blacku, whom he met in 2013, “he was surprised”
Daley married the Oscar winner (who is 20 years older from him) last year, indicating that such a difference in age was never a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death due to cancer three years later, he said, “it was difficult for him to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became Robert Ray Black-Next's parents in June, and Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
“Last year was the most important thing for me to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, he wanted to take place first.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be in the first place, Dad,’ he said.
“I cut him by the hand when he stopped breathing. It was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t defeated,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was what I had been dreaming about all my life, to jump into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song - the Proud performed by Heather Small - which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still seasons him with a thick skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Shown lack of form Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday part of the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to work on his form to keep his foot off.
Mickelson, who played twelve in the event every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Fourball and Foursome games.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as was often the case in his case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day on doping the team and working on improving his game in the hope of correcting the cause of his referral to the bench.
A 48-year-old who never gave the simplest hits, even at the peak point of his career, doesn’t work well on the tight Le Golf National field, where wrong hits are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently discouraging for Mickelson, on the ninth game on Sunday he must face the precision of the British Open winner Francesc Molinari, who joined forces with the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start a game with a line, Mickelson’s match may prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player, rather he could not do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, clicked me on his back, hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He’s very sure of himself.
He is famous in the gallery and has contributed a lot to the game of his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record for the Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 failures and seven draws in his account. Furyk said his presence has brought a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, and it’s good to have him in the band’s room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings more than just a game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant score advantage before the start of the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult gameplay.
In 1997, the Danish debuted in a match in the Valderama field, where, along with his fellow Vice-Captain Sev Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by the shortest of possible hair, winning 141-2-131-2.
“It’s not to be forgotten that we had a big advantage in the Valderama field; we also had a big advantage in the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the case of Valderama field we won only by hair,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 on both Friday and yesterday, which gave the lead 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow you're giving everything.
Get out there and do whatever it takes.
The end will only be when points appear on the board.
We have a goal of winning the trophy, and we need to focus on that.
From the beginning I said I’m focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people are on the opposite side, the best players in the world.
Bjorn, delighted with how his players managed to cope in a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow, however, is different.
The singles are starting tomorrow, and that’s another issue.
It’s good to play with your partner when everything goes by thought, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limits of possibilities.
This is a message that you have to pass on to the players, that is to give you everything tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything -
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will expect his players to achieve better results alone than when playing with a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced large turns of action on the last day, being a member of the winning team in Brookline, after which he failed after the European team performed “a miracle in Medinah” field.
“I remember every word,” Ben Crenshaw, captain, said in an answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, warmed up his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we are playing 12 important games - you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in Brookline and Medinah.
If this shoot goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our composition accordingly and set the boys in a way that would enable us to charm tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading a counter-attack, facing Roy McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European team players in the lead half of the show.
“I decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he’ll be able to do it during the whole game,” Bjorn said of his election on the single.
New German warship re-delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into use in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen at least next year due to defective systems and rising at an intimidating pace of costs, according to local media.
“Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate, was moved to the first half of 2019,” Die Zeit said in a statement.
The ship should be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but as a result of the problems that emerged after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, ensuring, among others, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances - the operation of new frigates should be possible even for two years away from home ports.
The ongoing delays, however, mean that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to foreign situations, will become obsolete at the time of service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front page of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported a number of key \"wareware and hardware warships\" that made the ship useless in the combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half as much as the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is much too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future modernizations.
It is believed that weighing 7,000 tons of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" ship is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project also becomes a problem, including the training of the crew.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was €2.2 billion.
Problems with dedication to the use of new frigates are of particular importance in light of the recent warnings that the power of the German naval fleet is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the sailors “end ships capable of using”
He also said that this problem increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from the operation of the old units without the provision of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret lives of bats
The new research conducted in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at showing how bats use the landscape when they get food.
The results of the research are expected to shed new light on the preservation of these exceptional flying mammals and help target future actions to protect them.
The research conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will cover common and small dwarfs, as well as brown long-eared bats and bats from the family of reds at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the estate, special recorders will be deployed to monitor the activities of bats all-season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field research using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings is designed to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the manner of behavior of individual species.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their landscape behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor at NTS, hopes to reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development work, which has an impact on the graves and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as well as glues on flies and some chemicals used in building materials and even domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to the nighttime hunting habits of their ears are more helpful than the eyes of the capture.
They use a complex technique of ecolocation to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspection of the graves, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats.
David Thompson, the owner of the estate, says it is ideal for bats.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.
It underlines the importance of controls for bats prior to their maintenance work in the estates, as the inadvertent destruction of a single grid can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected - killing, harassment or disturbing them, and destroying their graves is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don’t even know how their populations manage.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape as “fake news,” saying that people “want to promote” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
A Portuguese attacker, Juventus, was charged with rape by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel, the footballer was supposed to pay the woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the allegation of the allegations, in an instagram live message to his 142 million followers, described these reports as “fake news”
“No, no, no, no, no.
“Today’s news is fake news,” said the winner of the gold ball.
“They want to promote by using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my job.
“I’m happy and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy protection,” Reuters said.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer would demand compensation for \"moral damage in the amount responsible for the weight of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.\"
The alleged arrival took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at Ronaldo and Mayorg's night club, they reportedly went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped a woman analically, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged arrival and told her that he was “99% a good guy” who was seen by this “one percent”
According to Ronaldo’s documentation, the couple had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also says she went to the police and that she took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “feared of revenge” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says he wants to cancel the deal now, because he still can’t forget the alleged event.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: Britain “for all times would regret the departure of car manufacturers”
“The UK would have regretted it all the time if, after leaving the European Union, it had lost the status of world leader in car production,” Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He said: “He was concerned when Toyota UK official told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby will be temporarily suspended.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then production will be stopped at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, plans to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are, as car manufacturers say, the risks associated with the supply chain when Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on the principle of “just-in-time”, within which parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be obstacles at the border, which may lead to delays and shortages of parts, according to industry representatives.
As a representative of the company said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to its Derbyshire factory, so production would be stopped.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is \"precisely constructed to avoid border control.\"
“We need agreements. We want to reach the best of possible agreements that will allow us not only to enjoy our current success, but also allow us to make the right use of this situation,” he said in a BBC Radio 4 program today.
“Not only Toyota’s statements, but also other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue what consisted of a very efficient set of supply chains,” he said.
Toyota’s representative was unable to determine how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston’s plant for 24 years and is a member of Unite’s corporate board, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored again.
The government spokesperson said: \"We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union.\"
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed for another week due to the ongoing struggle for a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brittany Kavanaugh,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russian interference in elections, the links between close colleagues of Trump and Russia and the potential hindering of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire Deputy Attorney General, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a hearing to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of a 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he had to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set on Thursday.
Trump said he would have preferred not to release Rosenstein, and a meeting was put in place to avoid collusion with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee, during which the testimony was filed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and may be moved by another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We will see, I will certainly inform the press about this.
A few journalists questioned this statement: Sanders did not hold a press conference on the White House since September 10.
The program's lead, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason for this.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences are not caused by an unwillingness to \"ostentatious\" TV journalists, after which she added: \"I won't hide that they are \"ostentational.\"
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president is carrying out more sessions of ‘questions and answers’ than any other president before him,” she said, adding, without giving any evidence, “We have read the numbers,”
“The press conferences will continue to take place,” Sanders said, “but if journalists have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which you will be able to talk directly to the President of the United States -
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, acting too freely and sometimes strangely before the journalists gathered.
Health Minister writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to workers from European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to give them gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of examining applications for \"setled status\" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the summer, negotiations for the UK’s exit from the European Union continued. Appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British government has also intensified preparations for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide and non-EU colleagues bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went through an operation as a result of a head injury on Saturday in a match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with the defeat of the Tennessee team with the result of 31-27, said Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
“He came to the sideline, and then he went down to the ground,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed it on their noses and carried out further research.
Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie had been operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details about the type/size of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student fired from representing universities for a year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game, he had five strokes, which gives him 18 bars throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax fee when buying real estate in the UK
According to the new plans of tories, buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK.
This move is intended to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting a young electorate.
The increase in tax charges will include persons who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury predicts that it will receive as much as £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will report today that a higher tax fee will be charged to foreigners buying real estate in the UK and that additional funds obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to reduce Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract a young electorate with the promise of cheaper housing and increase the burden of more earning people.
Higher tax charges will apply to individuals and non-taxable companies in the UK. Additional measures will help the government fight homelessness.
An additional fee - charged in addition to the current tax fee, including higher rates for second houses and apartments purchased for rent introduced two years ago - can amount to up to three percent.
The state tax expects this move to allow you to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate, and most of the time they spend outside the country, many wealthy regions - and especially the capital - have turned into \"a city of spirits\"
The new rules come just a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in tax fees that would help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the area, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to abolish the limits of cheap apartments in order to eliminate \"a residential scandal\" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of eviction \"without reason -
He also wants to grant local governments more powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that as Prime Minister I would be committed to rebuilding the British dream of making every next generation better than the previous generation.
This also means repairing our staggered housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, for this humiliation associated with the necessity of having to sleep on the street remains still real.
Jack Ross: “My greatest ambition is to become Scotland’s choicer.”
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, says his \"greatest ambition\" is to become Scotland's picker at some point.
This 40-year-old Scottish team is committed to healing the North-East club, which is currently ranked third in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he introduced the St Mirren club back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player,
“But I only managed to get to Staff B,” Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched Scotland’s father’s matches in Hampden and it always attracted me.
However, such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as a club coach.
Among Ross's predecessors were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel intimidated, taking on a role after such great personalities in such a big club, rejecting earlier proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Today, success will be measured for me if I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and facilities, there is no doubt its place,” he adds.
“It’s not going to be easy to do this, but I’ll probably feel like I’ve been successful here, only if I can do it.”
Ross's coaching career lasts only three years, before he was assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa re-advanced after degrading to the third league, and in the next season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of the fall to the championship title.
Jack Ross claims that he is now feeling much more comfortable than when he was playing at Hyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real turning point,” says Allo, referring to the position of Alloa coach.
“I really believed that running a team was much better than playing alone.
It will sound strange, because as a player I did well, I earned well and achieved a few measurable successes.
Playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to the coach’s work, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it.
The entire interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, 30 September on the radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time

The summer heat wave caused a rapid influx of customers to British pubs, but it reflected a hiccup in the restaurant’s networks.
Studies have shown that sales in pubs and bars increased 2.7% in July, but in restaurants they fell 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who developed the data, said: “The continuous heat and longer than the expected share of England in the World Championships, caused the results of July to form similar to June when the pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant earnings fell even more.
The 1.8% drop in sales in restaurants in July increased even more.
The pubs and bars offered drinks did their best - their sales growth exceeded the drop recorded in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
It looks like people were just thirsty.
Drink sales in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month and food fell by three percent.
Paul Newman from RSM, a researcher on the entertainment and tourism industry, said: “These results are in line with the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the amount of consumption ‘outside the house’ remain the weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that the restaurant networks are experiencing difficult moments, no wonder, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences if you take into account the constant pressures on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for the owners of food restaurants and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such a necessary respiration -
The combined increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffee Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion. It sets recognized industry standards.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Studies have shown that one in five children, some only 11 years old, have secret accounts in social networks that hide from parents and teachers.
A survey conducted among 20,000 students of primary schools showed an increase in the number of pages \"fake Insta -
The news has raised concerns that the content they post is sexual.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “principal” account that shows parents
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years of age, set up accounts on social networks that are not disclosed to adults.
A survey conducted among 20,000 students of primary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts - the name refers to Instagram, in which you can share photos.
These news has strengthened concerns that these accounts are used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students admit that they have a “principal” account that shows parents and also has private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenager who told others to “rape them.”
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters - and Headmistresses - Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 run two profiles.
HMC Chairman Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers create their places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will become the “voice of athletes” by Scottish Athletics.
During the annual general meeting of the management board of the Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle, she was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most titled Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this as an excellent opportunity for sports managers to benefit from her rich international experience she has gained in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world’s light-aircraft communities, and we are confident that its introduction to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish light-aircraft,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, \"I am very happy to have the opportunity to give advice to athletes, and I hope I can really help in managing sports in Scotland.\"

Lactator advertising that compares mothers to cows raises extreme emotions on the Internet
A lactation company has triggered a storm on the Internet by publishing an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
In order to announce the launch of “the world’s first silent dresser, its manufacturer, Elvie, has released a sneaky video commercial that emphasizes the freedom it provides to mothers.
She presents the four true mothers dancing in a sledding giant to a song where she hears the words: “Yes, I get it, but I can’t see the tail” and “As if you didn’t notice, it’s not just my throats mentioned.”
“Refren says, ‘Put them out, let them go, I will feed them children, I will throw them away, I will give them away, my lords!’
The advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused huge controversy on the Internet.
The film now has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many say it is inappropriate to joke about “the horror that happens in the dairy industry.”
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they need to get pregnant and give birth to a carnivore, with their children being taken away from them after a few days of birth,” one user wrote.
Elvie Lactator can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “Of course, this is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactation for mothers that can stop their children -
Someone else added: \"This advertisement is completely detached from reality -
Another weapon of the clip, one of the women said the song was “fun”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second bottom in it.
It’s a brilliant invention, someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pull away food (often at work or toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactation attached discreetly to the breast.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many nursing women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Lactator is completely quiet, there are no cables or tubes and can be worn unnoticed under the breast to feed, which gives women the freedom to move, hold children on their hands, and even leave the house while taking out food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie’s lactator is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
By putting together nursing women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges of food withdrawal, while at the same time presenting in a fun and coherent way the amazing sense of freedom he provides.
It's not the first time that the Elvie lactation hit the top of the newspaper.
During the London Fashion Week during Marty Jakubowski’s show, the mother of two children with this product appeared.
Hundreds of children of immigrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained by immigrants is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border does not change every month. This is partly due to the fact that strict rhetoric and principles introduced by the administration of President Trump made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who fear exposure to deportation if they apply for a child.
Such a risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adults living in a joint holding, which would then be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified to Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who have filed as sponsors for children left unsafe.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not previously listed.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we are constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
The shelter staff say that as part of their efforts to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as was the case according to previous standards.
Much will be made through videoconference, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter staff and the reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children stay in custody, the easier it can become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to aggression or escape attempts.
Defenders have found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centres, such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is easier to overlook the signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them the right time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
During a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Syria, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, despite the fact that the war in this country has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally staying on Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “we will deal with them appropriately.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” the Assembly said.
Moualem says that “the war on terrorism has almost ended, in Syria, where more than 30,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to lead its holy battle to the purification of the territory of Syria, both from terrorist groups and from “all foreigners living on it illegally.”
Currently, there are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mainly training Kurdish forces and Syrians opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and counselling them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in a war-torn country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem stated that conditions are good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries,” of “arousing irrational fear,” which discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help in these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing things that should have a purely human dimension.
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad is opposed to a political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any help to rebuild.
United Nations diplomats say the last agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created the opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a large attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had “a clear time frame” and expressed hope that military action would be measured in jihadists, including militants associated with the Al-Qaeda Front of the Levant People’s Defense, who would be “eliminated”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to discuss soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the ruling and opposition party in order to draw up a draft post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “verifying the provisions of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Elections Again
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers may have hoped, his presidency would have ended earlier with the removal of office and scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to the presidency so far”
So far, there are no signs of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, the performance of the CNN channel was more than doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and the MSNBC channel nearly tripled, to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average, it attracts 2.4 million viewers at the highest viewing hours, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC broadcast program \"The Rachel Maddow Show - achieved the highest results among cable TVs, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers of night-time information programs.
“People are flying like moths to fire, that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, ABC’s lead producer, “Designed Survivor,” about the Cabinet Secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys, has a different theory.
She mentioned how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why,” she asked.
\"Because it makes me laugh,\" he replied.
“Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, reports from Washington could, like anything else on television, have considered the future of Roe v. Wade, the admissibility of linking immigrants’ families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
In addition, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen when you’re watching Bob Woodward’s panel of experts discussing the use of the book “Fear” by writing about Paul Manafort’s skin jacket for $15,000 (“push-loaded clothing, as The Washington Post has said), or the implications of shocking descriptions of President Trump’s anatomy revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario as I used to.
“What he does is partly resembling the reality show in that he delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the changing cast and daily returns of the Trump show (as an attack on NFL league players or the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode, because you'll have arrears.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where she has her house, was beautiful, but he sat inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just before the Senate Judiciary Commission and the future of the Supreme Court was weighing.
“I remember how we did all these crazy programs and people were saying ‘this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were kidding, but it turns out they were right.

Inflow of money from the outside to the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the electoral districts, which will now be two elected congressmen in the race for one position, to the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania, the river flows in cash.
This recently formed suburban district of Pittsburg represents a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represented the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new district 17.
The maps of the districts were corrected after the January judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled that the old districts were unfairly designated, giving the Republicans an advantage and were incompatible with the constitution.
The race in the new district 17 began with the campaign’s funding campaign between the main party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaignal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning for hair in widely commented elections to the 18th constituency held in March.
Republican has been in this position for over a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts gave Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, despite the light opposition of Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, and until the partners of the Trump Organization management team had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to cancel U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to stop the recognition of Taiwan,” said a statement from the Department’s spokesperson, Heather Nauert.
However, the sanctions considered were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received $140 million in aid from the United States, among other things, to combat drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions to be imposed on financial assistance and visas for specific persons would be very severe for this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference to address the conclusions of a similar assembly last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, top-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any consideration of the sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at a conference that is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is expected to appear, which is supposed to be a sign of an invitation to the assembly of administrative representatives.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who, subject to anonymity, agreed to discuss internal persecutions.
Their relationships were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration’s environment, who also said anonymously.
Learn history
Another element may be the Special Prosecutor’s report, Robert Mueller, on the possible obstacle to President Trump’s justice, which is currently available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation also examines whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the US election.
If Congress's composition changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him when preparing for re-election before the voters, or maybe even be judged in front of the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or people in equal positions in Europe, is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will decide how long it will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are now a few such turning points in front of the Americans.
What do we do if Donald Trump releases Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man Robert Mueller depends on?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our newspaper that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated that he was not suitable for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the relationship presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the FBI’s newly ordered investigation into Bretta Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court in spite of the credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?”
And first of all, will we elect in the middle of the presidential term people who will take responsibility for Donald Trump?
If we do not pass these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my embassy residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the scabies on that table marked with swastika.
Having a legacy like I could not look optimistically into the future.

Rangers, Graham Dorrans, is looking forward to a match with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the awareness that victory with Austrians, obtained after an impressive draw with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the G League of Europe.
Until the 2:2 draw from Villareal, knee injury prevented Assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on Rangers like a trampoline for more success.
“We did well because Villarreal is in good shape,” said the 31-year-old.
\"We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something - and we won the point.
Perhaps at the end we could still push them, but generally, the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will be able to score three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent has achieved a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and this and we will win a positive result.
The last year was definitely heavy because of everything connected with my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
“I hope we can keep going, leave the last season behind, and succeed.”
Fear of retirement savings spends women’s dreams with eyelids
Even though those who participated in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to deal with them, few talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with the kids.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Nationalwide vice president of life insurance.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you express your will earlier.
Together with your advisor and family, talk about where and how you want them to take care of you, because this choice will be an important factor in determining the cost.
Ask for help from a financial advisor: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional policy to such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property, if you own it.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent this from taking place in court battles.
Designate a trusted healthcare attorney who will oversee and ensure that the right people act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of an attorney who will take care of the finances.
Choose a trusted person because they will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don’t forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical help and just goes to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all the information to get it ready.
“It’s not just about finance, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
It is worth having such a plan at hand -

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the broken communication, the rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Donggala cabupaten, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 degree earthquake.
After the Pala disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the most important informations about the city of Palu and the Cabupata of Donggala on Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebese, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates, in 2017 there were 379,800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, it was the 40th anniversary of its founding in the city.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit with a level lower than the province) stretching along the north-west coast of the island over 300 km long.
It was estimated that 299 200 people lived in 2017.
The main branches of the Central Celebese economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the Donggala Cabupate.
Another source of income from the province is nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disruption Agency, in the past 100 years, earthquakes and tsunamis have been raiding Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, a tsunami that struck Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people were killed as a result of the tsunami in West Donggali.
Indonesia is located on an active seismic Pacific fire ring, making earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
Largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The large earthquake that hit the west coast of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, there was a 6.8-degree earthquake, causing tsunamis that entered the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra, there was a 7.6-degree earthquake.
As a result, more than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of Mentawai islands near the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A plate earthquake struck Pidie Jaya Kabupaten in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who continued to remember the destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed.
2018: Large earthquakes visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and caused temporary troubles for thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested under charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Wasilla, Alaska, 29-year-olds were arrested with allegations of domestic violence, making it difficult to report and resist arrests.
According to a police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report the crime, he took her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su custody and has a fine of $500.
According to her information, on Saturday, he stood before a court where, in his defense speech, he stated that he was “certainly innocent.”
There are three A-class offences in Palin, which means he can be fined up to a year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He was also charged with a B-class offence for which he was threatened with a $2,000 prison day and fine.
It's not the first time that Palin's criminal charges have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently taking place before the Alaskan Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, making it difficult for him to file a report and possess weapons in an indiscriminate state in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticized Sara Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior with the post-traumatic stress syndrome she had got while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died of tsunami after an earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed as a result of a Friday earthquake that visited the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social media there are films showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York prosecutors demand death sentences for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment - it has not been executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used the rented Home Depot truck, which he started walking and cyclists on his way.
According to a report filed in the South District of New York, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “targetedly” killed eight victims and “targetedly” caused serious injury to the body.
According to a court document, both of these charges are threatened with a death penalty.
A few weeks after the federal attack, Saipov's court filed a charge of 22 positions, including eight charges of illegal murder - a procedure usually applied by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime - and an allegation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, organizing the attack required “solid planning and thinking,” the way Saipov carried it out, they called it “monstery, cruel, and immoral.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine citizens who lived in New York City.
The last time the death penalty in the South District of New York was filed ten years ago.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were lost in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show a conscience in months after the attack.
Police say he told the investigator that he feels good about what he did.
According to a letter of charges, Saipov admitted to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
Police said he also called for the ISIS flag to be suspended in his hospital room.
22 allegations that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenses who represent Saipov, said they are “disappointed for obvious reasons” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty and to refuse life without the possibility of early release after the admission to guilt will only extend the suffering that these events have brought to all concerned,” he said.
Saipova’s defense team has asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Parliamentary Toryist Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Take Responsibility for Brexit Negotiations
In today's protest, which took place during the Tories Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to \"mobilize the army of the people\"
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel warmly” against Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s parliamentarians suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A conservative MP, Peter Bone, told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage were Brexit secretary, “the United Kingdom would be outside the Union.”
However, the addition of the tories opting for staying in the community to the separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, has even more stressed the weight of the task of reconciling its deeply divided ranks, which are facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her plan of compromise with the Chequers in the midst of attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the European Union itself.
Its allies argue that despite opposition, it will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between its proposal and “chaos”
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to “send a plan from Chequers.”
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the Agent to be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were to do this, we would now be outside the Union,” he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be subject to anyone now.
We want to be our own rights in our own country.
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their mind since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue,” he said.
The demonstration also included Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party, who told reporters: “I am just saying: Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the general support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who populate the streets and who have chosen us will not support it either.
Please give up your plan with Chequers and start listening.
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: “Primes keep their positions when they keep their promises,” she said.
Nigel Farage said politicians involved in the demonstration must “feel warmly if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say ‘we won’t let you do it’.”
He added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the edge of Brexit’s betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of this country’s people, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
At that time, the opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved banners \"Torysi against Brexit - after the group was formed this weekend.
The active Labourist, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed at conservatives for the security issues of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are people who claim to be able to organize IT systems and all technology to support Canada plus, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to “seriously consider running for president”
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after November’s election, “he will seriously consider running for president.”
According to The Boston Globe, a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a meeting with voters held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will apply for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that Warren could defeat Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time “women went to Washington to fix our broken government,” and she also means a woman at the top.
The arrest of a deadly shooter in which the LSU player, Wayde Sims, died
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday in which a basketball player from the LSU team, Wayde Sims, died.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during the conference, which took place at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, a shooting video was released asking for help to identify a man visible on him.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims died as a result of a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot with firearms in his head, as a result of which he died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the scene of the crime, carrying weapons and shooting at Wayde.
After the arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to jail in the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
He was raised in Baton Rouge at 1,98 m of Junior Wayde Sims. He played 32 matches, with 10 times in the last season, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the park, he scored 5.6 points and counted 2.9 collections per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team’s command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team’s command will have a great impact on the race’s outcome.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to go in the tail of a pellet, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes player went to boxing in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-wheel action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking pushing to the defensive after a double-moved rival to defend the position on the third turn, Hamilton went on to drive.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the rate and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday at the end of his first round.
Then, through a large part of the race, he led by the fact that he did not change the tyres in order to perform a quick finish and take Kimi Raikkonen fourth position.
In the end, he went to the service point at the 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps he failed to speed up. The fourth place was taken by Raikkonen.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
“The whole team gave everything to take the first two,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump purchased from Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed that she did not reveal the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the nominee of sexual assault by the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimonies filed by Christina Ford before the Senate Committee on Justice. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people were \"submissive, malicious, and false.\"
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we have witnessed for a few days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, angry, malicious and lying,” he said.
“We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’”
I didn't do that.
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it -
Wait a minute.
Did we reveal...No, we did not reveal,” he added, cutting the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and his content leaked in early September.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“She asked me to be discreet and I didn’t reveal these content according to her request.
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve seen in my life.
By continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats used insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all means.
They see impolite, malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they need to destroy to take over power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants team.
Dundee Stars played their fifth loss in the Elite League with the Belfast Giants team, winning a 5:3 match on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a two-way advantage after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier shot.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowie leveled the result, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard once again leveled the score, winning a goal for the Dundee team, and then two goals shot by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe’s supporters, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, won with Dundee in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season - the first three games were won by the Giants.
The opening goal of Dwyer fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendal McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the result thanks to David Rutherford's assistant.
After an intense opening at 13:10 a.m., Sullivan introduced the host team back to the game, and then Matt Marquardt leveled the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants before the first break, when at the end of the first year he won his second goal that evening.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard re-balanced the score with a goal gained during the 27:37 minute game.
At the end of the second game, Cowie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen secure the first in this match. The final victory of Dundee was sealed in the middle of the last target by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost four to their last five games will play their next match at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies helping hundreds of people on the plane escape earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was shouted by a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many were found missing after a major earthquake that struck Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
There are still severe secondary shocks in the area. Many people have been trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonias Gunawan Agung refused to leave the post in the turbulent tower of flight control at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was there to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft (Flight 6321), which was just on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he seemed to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports from the Australian ABC News station, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the controller’s decision was likely to save hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonias left this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“This message has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The National Disaster Resolution Agency reports that the possibility of accessing Donggala, Sigi and Boutique cities is limited.
“We believe that the harvest of death continues to grow because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.
The six-metre tsunamis destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
Drinking water is missing.
Small shops are poached.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find in place.
This is a tragedy, and it can be even worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Pala, who turned to the military: “Please all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready,” CNN reports.
This year, Indonesia has already been hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on Lombok Island.
A plane crash in Micronesia - Air Niugini reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed into a lagoon
Airlines operating a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific inform that one person was missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon, one man who traveled on a feral plane could not count.
They assured that together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators they were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details regarding the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk, the rescue of other passengers and crew members helped local boats.
The officials said on Friday seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the disaster, and its exact course is also unknown.
Airlines and U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
“That helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said he managed to get through the water to the emergency outlets of the sinking plane and other people.
According to him, the crew members were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that in a rescue operation, the sailors who were working nearby on the modernization of the coast were also helping. With the help of the inflatable boat, they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sunk to about 30 meters deep.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in plane disasters in Papua New Guinea, but there are no Air Niugini.
Analyst Reconstructs Night Events When A Woman Was Burned
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office ended up presenting evidence in a re-process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has testified for hours as a law-enforced intelligence analyst.
He described to the judges how he re-created the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on a feral evening.
When the data confirmed that at the time when Quinton’s complex testimony was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said, \"He lied because my truck was then in Nashville.\"
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's claim that he knew Chambers for about two weeks.
Mobile phone records have shown that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis removed her contact details from the phone, as well as SMS and calls.
“He deleted it from his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech will begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably still be handed over to the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed from Bristol, today’s hip-hop has left the original political content and social issues.
Members of the team want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of the conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the works of such artists as Akala and Lowkey, the rebirth of such artists as The Fugees and the Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black?!
In New York, a couple has been sued for “racist” release
In New York, a couple is sued for releasing her from her racist work after receiving a misappointed SMS in which the mother of a child complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racists, comparing the lawsuit to “strangement”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly contorted when it turned out that the new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, who waved on the first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NIEEE, CALEJNA CHRANA OBA,” she wrote in an SMS to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to him, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice by mistake.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the gaf she had committed, she was “crazy,” released by Gisella Maurice, claiming that a cordial ninja, who is an African-American, had been doing her duty badly, and that she was expecting a ninja from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for the day of work and then returned to Uber's home.
Now she is demanding a pair of compensations for $350 a day, multiplied for six months, for which she was originally employed with housing, although she did not sign the contract.
“I want to show them that these things are not done,” Post said on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejects the allegations of racism, claiming that the end of cooperation with Mrs. Maurice was justified, because after insulting her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent something she didn’t want to talk to her.
She's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said his husband, Joel Plasco.
“Would you entrust your children to a person you’re sorry for, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, come on, come on.
Comparing the lawsuit to \"the scandal,\" Plasco said that his wife had been born just two months earlier and was in \"a very difficult situation\"
“Are you going to blow something like that?”
This is not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the case has not yet ended in court, the public quickly issued a sentence on social media, criticizing it for its behavior and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s books feared readers wouldn’t feel connected to the talking mission.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the warm adoption of the book, says of the letter: “It is hard to place the person who read it for the first time, even before the book is published.
It’s very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.
He claims that her father, who, before a small plush bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a cameraist at the BBC, was sure his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year’s 60th anniversary of the book’s release seems “sweet-hot-
On Paddington, whom he describes as “a very important member of our family,” says her father was in secret proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t worship,” he added.
“However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something, you feel proud of him, even though it’s not your merit.
I think Paddington's success was seen in such a way.
Although he himself invented and created it, he always earned the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When her daughter landed, she was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
“We call regularly and say it’s really bad that it’s probably not going to come out,” says Tina Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did anyway.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be back soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart action slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She died a while earlier and it was the end of everything.
I could only sit and wait with the knowledge that it was all developing.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to stick -
In the end, Tina Ednan-Laperouse, who had already lamented the loss of her daughter, came on board with other passengers, unaware of the sufferings she had been through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had my head set off, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt all-embracing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards from women in grief to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are trying to distract others from their intention to take away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I feel every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a well-announced cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that he could make every room brighter.
Before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old, and he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m still afraid of the domino effect.
Sharon Davis created cards to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t be quiet, talk to someone.
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Daisy for years, soon after her mother's death, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
“Nothing said that he felt beaten, sad, or something,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was already in a complete hole. When the children opened gifts, he didn't even look at them -
He says that his death was very painful to them, but they had to deal with it: “It pulls out a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight -

Bretta Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italian because the FBI is initiating an investigation
\"I thought if we could really get what he asked for -- a limited-term investigation -- maybe we could achieve some unanimity --\" said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the commission would \"break down\" into opposing camps, which leads to impassion.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
The elections to Congress are already in a few weeks - 6 November. If, according to predictions, Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a specific person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush has already raised his headset to call the senators and urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is uncertain whether Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and introduce him to the Supreme Court.
Kim's number of North Korean refugees is decreasing
According to South Korean lawmakers, from seven years ago Kim Jong Un took over, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug said that last year 1127 escapes were recorded, and in 2011-2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more accurate checks at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates collected by human traffickers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately the proposed citizenship of South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seoul, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans from the North have illegally crossed the border.
Most are fleeing China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often by force they send them back to their country.
The relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks about negotiations on denuclearization that had previously come to a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in June in Singapore.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not making any progress on the issue.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and in these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally defend ourselves as the first,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh a \"hysterical\" and says he's not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brittany Kavanaugh \"a hysteric\" and said that by nature he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke these words during an interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think if a woman behaved like this, she would be considered a ‘hysteric’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh had filed Thursday before the Senate’s Justice Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his initial speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions - he almost screamed and lost his speech when he discussed family and high school issues.
He also made it clear to the Democrats of the committee, setting out the allegations of \"a grotesque and coordinated attack on reputation - organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would have tried to appeal Kavanaugh if he had received the nomination and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court in which he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democratic she is afraid of Kavanaugh’s possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because she is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh overlooked questions as to whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not time for a hysterical court, a prejudiced person who expects us to say ‘how wonderful’,” Pelosi added.
And women must control it.
It's the right diatribe, the months and the years of the shedding fury, and she can't throw it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
“It’s quite common, isn’t it?”
She added: “A woman who was a manager in a company helped me a great deal. She said she was also crying when she was angry, but she invented herself in such a way that when she gets upset and starts crying, she speaks to the person she’s talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are acceptable as the passing of anger in part because they are basically misinterpreted.
One of my obvious memories from one of the first jobs in a man-dominated office is how I once started to cry out of unspeakable anger. A certain older woman, a cool manager I was always afraid of, took me behind my neck and took me to the staircase.
“Never let them see how you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think they're sad, and they're happy they've taken care of them.
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then MP of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his lover on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, she realized that she might actually consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a thought-out decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates to the election and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described this situation as ‘The Queen of Snow and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder had arrears in fundraising and promised herself that she would not join the race if she didn’t collect $2 million.
It was a battle sentenced to loss.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave the men a thousand dollars, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts,” she asked.
During the speech, in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions - gratitude for those who supported her, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to collect money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism - that the voice tied her up in her throat.
“You might think I’ve gone through a nervous breakdown,” the press said.
“You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my gravestone.
'She was crying?'
Beijing's economic war between the United States and China
Salves starting the U.S.-China economic war were depressing and although the battle is still going on, in the long run, the conflict between these countries could be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was shot this year by US President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on China’s key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariff rates on goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Every time Beijing retaliated in nature, raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike and does not look like the second economy in the world is about to give up.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but a public bowing head to the United States would be too embarrassing for China’s President Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the US trade war could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions to unleash economic chaos in one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than the observers have previously admitted,” said Azia’s researcher at the New American Security Center’s think tank.
Syria’s foreign minister said it was “prepared to return refugees”
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding the country destroyed as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, said the conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation in our area is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
In order to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic shifts aimed at their daily lives and means of maintenance can voluntarily return to it.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept the aid provided for by the conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe Seals Win at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team by 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and since 1993 it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it won 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the US.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who didn’t go well for most of the tournament, hit the ball from the base straight into the water at the 16th PAR3 hole, thus giving the match to Francesc Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was shining through all the rounds and became one of the four players who since 1979, when this tournament was first held in the current format, managed to get a score of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by the 5&4 score by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who ranks the highest in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with Anglican Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
A European with the highest number of wins in the Ryder Cup was the Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and earned 25.5 points of career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am very happy to get the cup back.
It’s the success of the whole team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after winning the team from Europe.
He gives a bat to his countryman, John Rahm, who defeated a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, on Sunday.
“I feel the incredible pride of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all the matches in France and now has 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It is an unprecedented statistic, as for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles and yielded only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the race all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance of the American composition, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed a little bit of Europeans.
We're back.
Head hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played much better than us.
