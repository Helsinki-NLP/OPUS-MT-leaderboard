Members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they will “look like fools”
Some members of the National Assembly were afraid to change their title to “MWP” (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was created in relation to the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned that this could make fun of.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that “the abbreviation is riveting with the words twp and pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh it means \"twp - foolish and \"pwp -\" means cocoa.
A member of the Welsh Party said the party as a whole was “unsatisfied” and proposed alternatives.
A Conservative party member said his party was approaching a change in the name \"liberal\" - but he noted that from the abbreviation MWP it is not far from the word \"muppet\" (the puppet, the fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter ‘w’ is pronounced like the letter ‘u’.
The Commission is currently working on a proposal for a bill that will bring about amendments to the names, which said: \"The final decision on the possible designation of the members of the assembly will, of course, be the responsibility of the Members themselves -
The 2017 Wales Administration Act gave the Wales National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the debate on proposals with the public, and the results showed that the change in the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament has broad support.
As regards the designation of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Deputies of the Welsh Parliament’ (WMP), but the biggest support in the debate with the public was given the MWP option.
The assembly members are obviously trying to propose alternative options, but the problem may be reaching an agreement, especially for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform laws will also include further changes to how the Assembly works, including the rules on the exclusion of Members and the proposal for a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on their label when they discuss the laws.
Macedonians go to electoral urns in referendum on country name change
Voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to “Northern Republic of North America” on Sunday.
The popular vote was declared in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour expresses its claim to the Greek territory and therefore repeatedly opposes the country’s requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Ďorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, voters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price a country must pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church Bells As a result of Harlem Church Problems
“The old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams says.
“Today there are neither one nor the other.
In his opinion, the loss of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he says.
“The bar is no longer a living room where people from the surrounding area meet regularly.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, \"and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning -
As he said, churches could be printed out by rent homes, while residential districts will be filled with people who will not support the remaining temples around.
“The great majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be made up of whites,” he says. “The day will come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most people coming to these neighborhoods will belong to these churches.”
The two churches built white congregations before Harlem became the metropolis of the black population. The Metropolitan Community church was built in 1870, the Church of St. Martin a decade later.
The original white congregation of Methodists moved in the 1930s.
The claim to the building was imposed by a black congregation that carried out the devotional activities nearby.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson. He was the central figure of the boycott of retailers on 125th street (the most important street with shops in Harlem) who refused to hire and support blacks.
In 1939, the building was significantly damaged, but Father Johnson’s parishes made the church’s plans to restore it.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and his successor to the Church of St. Martin, proudly called this belloplay “the sounds of the poor.”
A specialist who played on the bell tower in July called it otherwise: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”
This specialist is Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind. He began playing at a larger bell game in the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says that no one was able to replace him in the Church of St. Martin.
During the last few months, a complex story of architects and suppliers took place in the Church of St. Martin. Some were brought by secular leaders of the Church, others were episcopal diocese.
The parish report, made up of secular leaders and who governs the parish, wrote in July that she feared that the diocese “will leave the reimbursement of the costs of the parish administration, despite the fact that the parish administration did not participate in the hiring of the architects and suppliers whose diocese it sent.
Some parishes complained of a lack of transparency in the conduct of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Boy Hunting Lobsters in California Injured a Shark
On Saturday, a 13-year-old shark was attacked and injured by a boy who hunted for a smoker in California on the opening day of the homo-season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitase.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was excited, that he caught a homo, but then \"he found out that the boy was screaming, 'I was bitten!
Something bit me!”
He had a completely broken key bone,” Hammel said, noting what he first noticed when he got to the boy.
“I revalved them all to go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was aired to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The kind of shark that attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said there was a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries at the top of the body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's in Encinitasa for 48 hours due to investigations and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but they are usually not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to create an aisle with cosmetics in the style of business houses and compete with the chains Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams. Specialized assistants will be available.
This is a significant investment of £2.8 billion in the cosmetics market in the UK, which is constantly growing, while sales in fashion and domestic needs are falling. Larger aisles with cosmetics in 11 stores across the country will be tested as part of the investment. If this step is successful, more trades will be added next year.
Investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on shelves that once belonged to TVs, microwaves and domestic needs.
Sainsbury’s officials said they would double their cosmetics range to 3,000 products, with Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees products will be given more space.
In addition, the supermarket is re-placing its range of Boutique Mejkapa to make most of the products available to vegans, as young customers increasingly require it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first store was opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second will be open by the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and the trend of everyday buying small amounts of food in local stores with different goods means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores would increasingly resemble stores. His chain of supermarkets is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and other than food goods.
Sainsbury's has incorporated Argos stores into hundreds of stores and integrated several Habitat stores. Both chains bought the company two years ago. According to its representatives, this step increased the sale of food, making the acquisitions more advantageous.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the department with cosmetics and medicines ended with failure.
Sainsbury’s tested the joint operation with Boots after 2000, but the merger ended the dispute over the distribution of pharmacies’ revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its medical company with 281 Celesio stores three years ago. This company owns LloydsPharmacy and sales value was 125 million pounds.
The company said Lloyds would play an important role in adding a wider range of premium skin care products, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and style of the aisles with cosmetics to make our customers shop in a more pleasant environment.
In addition, we have invested in special training of colleagues who will be on hand and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all requirements. The impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a significant destination in cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping -
Peter Jones, “crazy” that Holly Willoughby has signed for £11 million
Dragons’ Day Day star Peter Jones, “crazy” that TV moderator Holly Willoughby has signed for £11 million with his lifestyle product brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand of interior accessories and accessories Truly.
The company was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
This Morning (37) has announced on Instagram that it is over.
Holly Willoughby was angry with Dragons' Peter Jones' Day show star, leaving the joint lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her own new mega-stakes with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones “was angry when a golden girl on television during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his Marlowe business empire in Buckinghamshire admitted that new contracts, with a value of up to £1.5 million, mean she won’t have enough time to devote to their brand of interior accessories and Truly accessories.
The company was compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated assets of £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “The Truly project was definitely the number one priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, with it being secured for decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was absolutely shocking.
On Tuesday, no one understood what was going on, and the launch was so close.
In the Marlowe headquarters, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale -
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning session’s moderator, which is one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, can cost the company millions. The reason for this is huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and home accessories, but also the possibility of further delay in marketing.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby designed the Truly project with Capp in 2016 and Jones (52) became director in March.
These two couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin, who hosts the I'm A Celebrity session of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We’re not going to talk about business matters.
“We fell in love with each other.”
He joked about the criticism he was expecting from the media for his comment, and some will consider him “unworthy president” and will blame him for his positive comment on North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump replied with his timid “moderator” voice.
“I don’t sacrifice anything at all.
He noted that after the initial joint meeting in Singapore in June, Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump celebrated the first meeting as a big step towards removing North Korea’s nuclear weapons.
However, the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been stuck.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korea’s chief diplomat, Ri Jong, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “adequate response” from the U.S. to North Korea’s first steps in disarmament.
He noted that the U.S. is still applying sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump was more optimistic in his speech before the assembly.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great relationship -
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of missile tests, the liberation of hostages and the return of remaining American soldiers home.
He also advocated an unusual way of talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s easy to talk like a president, but then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people out there trying to get in. Instead, there would be 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right ahead.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have ravaged one of the islands and killed hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to leave their homes, a nationwide disaster was not declared, which is a necessary condition for obtaining international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not require international assistance, and that is a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children consists of a team that will travel to Pala, it is not yet certain if foreign workers will be able to operate in the field.
A spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugro National Disaster Agency said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in auxiliary work.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly facing, the country’s preparedness for nature’s anger is lamentable.
In Acehu there are shelters from the tsunamis, but they are not common on other coasts.
A large number of victims of life were likely to have contributed to the lack of siren warning against tsunamis in Pala, despite the fact that there was an active warning.
Even in favorable conditions, travelling between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, located on Lombok to provide care to the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Pala, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has built his electoral campaign to improve the enraged Indonesian infrastructure. He has generously spent on roads and railways.
However, the Widod administration is suffering from a lack of funding, and next year it will be re-elected.
In addition, Widodo faces pressure for the persistent religious tension in Indonesia, as Muslim majority supporters have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
During the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, more than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes. Gangs used machetes, bows and arrows and other raw weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of the FC Liverpool from a distance leveled against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat with Chelsea in the Premier League, scored at the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea Gate.
You threw the ball to the left and sent the shot to the far side.
His attempt sailed high above the penalty territory and directed towards the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell into the net through the winding Chapu Arrizabalaga.
“I was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I made one touch, I didn’t think much about it, and I shot it,” he said.
Chelsea led after a half-life of 1:0. In the 25th minute, the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored behind it.
In front of this goal, Blues returned the pass to Mate Kovačić, turned in the middle of the field and sprinted half of Liverpool.
Kovačić showed a quick bumper in the middle of the field.
Then he sent a beautiful pass-through, which had been heading to the penitentiary territory with Hazard.
Gambling overtook the defenders and ended up at a more distant bar when he overtook the Liverpool goaltender Alisson Becker with a shot on the left.
Liverpool is in battle against Naples in the Champions League group stage. The game starts on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea will fight Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday from 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency on Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that destroyed the 7.5-degree earthquake. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugro said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has filled the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder of woman killed
This morning, a murder investigation began after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found 7:55 a.m. on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police are encouraging people in this area who have seen or heard something come to testify.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"The investigation is in the early stages, but I call on all those near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on all, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded anything using an on-board camera to connect with us because they may have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who thought they knew a woman. They wanted to find out where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver who lives in the Grasson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could get into the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
The owners of the apartments are now learning that they will get in in a few hours.
One police officer has heard another man saying that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
He says, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police supplies were in the cordon, and the next delivery was outside.
There were several policemen in the cordon who were watching the panel house.
Police are asking all those who have information to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers unit at 0800 555 111, citing Protocol 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to the dispute over \"rewriting history\"
Its removal would be a satisfaction for the fact that its fanatical Puritan supporters, like the Taliban, destroyed so many English cultural and religious artifacts.
Cromwell’s company, however, called Crick’s proposal “the foolish” and “the attempt to rewritten history”
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell’s company, said: “When discussing the removal of sculptures, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not arrange or perform an iconoclasm of English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The grand realization of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thornycroft testifies to his perception in the 19th century and is part of the history of personality that many still deserve respect.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell’s many consider them, perhaps at the end of the 19th century there were more than today, as a defender of parliament against the external forces, in his case, of course, a defender of the monarchy.
Whether it is a complete accurate description of the fact, historians continue to debate.
However, it is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique personality that embodies one side of the dispute.
The achievements he has achieved as Lord Protector also deserve celebration and respect.
China's Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a farmer attacked and killed pigs in the south-east market.
A man who is referred to only by the surname of Yuan, found dead with a broken artery and bloodshed near the bread market in the prefecture Liou-pchan-sui in the province of Kuyzhou. The report was reported on Sunday by the newspaper South China Morning Post.
The pig breeder is preparing the vaccine in the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning Prefecture in Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he reportedly traveled along with his cousin from the neighboring province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and found out that the door of the by-bread was open.
He said that he was a large male pig with a bloodthirsty parrot in his bread.
According to a report, the court investigation confirmed that this 250-kilogram chancellor had mutilated the farmer to death.
“Bratranec had bloody and crushed legs,” said Wu’s cousin, citing Guiyang Evening News.
According to a record of security cameras, Yuan arrived on Thursday 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't harm Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager for Evening News said the pig was separated from attacking someone else while the police were collecting evidence.
Yuan's family and market representatives are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although attacks of pigs on humans are rare, they have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man's critical injury.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor until his wife was able to rinse the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a “starter”
“They’re just playful.
Chance, they're curious... they don't intend to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them reasonable respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring heavy rain to many places in the Southwest.
According to a prediction, Hurricane Rosa is weaker, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains to the north of Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
Rosa reached wind speeds of 137 km/h on Sunday at 5 a.m. East American Time, a category of 1 hurricane. It was located 620 kilometers southwest of the Mexican Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a cortex that moves eastward towards the west coast of the United States began to form over the Pacific Ocean. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she starts pushing deep tropical humidity north to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 25 centimeters of rainfall on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Tropical humidity then, combined with the approaching bark, creates vast and dense rain in the coming days in the southwest.
In some places, there will be 2 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, which will cause severe dangerous floods, watering and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rains during which the precipitation drops 5 to 8 millimetres per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas in the southwest, especially above the large part of Arizona, precipitation is expected from 5 to 10 centimeters.
There may be severe floods, as conditions deteriorate rapidly, which is due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Due to the threat of tropical rain, it would be extremely unwise to go on foot in the desert.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to rage in the canyons, with storms locally bringing sharp winds with dust in the air.
The approaching seabed in some places on the coast of southern California will cause severe local rain.
It can fall more than 13 millimetres of precipitation, which could cause less watering and glide of roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during its rainy season.
On Sunday evenings and Mondays early in the morning, the scattered rains of tropical rain begin to get closer to Arizona. On Mondays evening and Tuesdays, the rain will be widespread.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there may be significant fluctuations in temperature throughout the U.S., as the Arctic cools, while the tropical zone remains quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes at a short distance.
A great example of sharp temperature changes is the middle of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City in Missouri and Omahe in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, it will try again to transplant and expand the continuing summer heat.
In the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October is expected in many places, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees in several territories from the South plains to the north-east.
In New York City, there may be 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 5.5 degrees above the diameter.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the U.S. East during the first half of October.
Bretta Kavanaugh’s hearing watched more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks an impressive statement by the nominee of the Supreme Court of Brittany Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault.
In the meantime, a political patte persisted. Only on Friday radio and television stations interrupted the broadcast for the last minute: Senator Arizona Jeff Flake secured an agreement on the basis of which the FBI could investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was holding her in a state-of-the-art position and trying to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who spoke passionately, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers were watched by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average follow-up of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen has usually problems measuring tracking in offices.
For comparison - a similar number of viewers follow the play-off game of American football or the handover of Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-creating moderators strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was followed by an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, the most of which is among all networks.
The ABC station was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.44 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was high even after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes and listened to the regrets of the CNN station.
“I stand right here,” said one of the women.
\"You think he's telling the country the truth -
Someone said to him, “You have great power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement before the elevator closed, adding that he would say more at the hearing.
All cable and other networks also dealt live with the matter a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would be passed to the entire Senate for vote.
Flake said he would only do this if the FBI investigates allegations against the nominee over the next week, which minority Democrats urgently ask for.
Flakea partly convinced talks with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's election had great power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanaugh's approval without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of “playing political games” over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her intention to leave the European Union of “playing political games - with the future of Britain and distorting national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May comes to the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which is next to the interview with her on the headline side of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her plan under a Brexit that is compared to the lady's game. He said that the proposal that Britain and the EU should choose each other's tariffs is \"extremely absurd.\"
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU's death
Police arrested a suspect who reportedly shot Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and arrested for second-degree murder, police department at Baton Rouge said.
The authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims had lost his glasses during the battle.
Police found Simpson's DNA on the scene of the crime, according to WAFB, a partner of the CBS network.
After the hearing, Simpson's police reported that he admitted that Simsa had been shot.
According to the advocacy, his deposit was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner Office issued a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a head and neck fire injury.
The department thanked the state police’s refugee unit in Louisiana, the state police’s criminal lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for “sustaining and promoting justice”
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew in Baton Rouge, where he played basketball for LSU and his father Wayne.
Last season, it had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per match.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said that the team was “torted” and “shocked” by Sims’ death.
“You’re constantly worried about this,” Wade said.
Volcano Spears Ash on Mexico City
Ash, rolling from the Popocatepetl volcano, reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to avoid volcanoes on Saturday, after the activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered in 24 hours.
The resort has seen noise and shocks several times.
In social media photos, thin layers of ash were seen covering cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians found an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after central Mexico hit a 7.1-degree earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police meet with Catalan separatists before independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting for independence came into conflict with the order police. Other thousands participated in parallel demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on the tearing up that divides society.
A group of masked separatists stopped the order police. They threw eggs and powder paint, and so there were streets in which it was sometimes sneaked by tourists, full of dark clouds of dust.
Later, during the day, there were also clashes, and the police used shoes to get the battlers under control.
During a few hours of a group of independence supporters who sang \"we do not forget, we do not forgive - they faced Unionist Protestants who shouted \"let Spain live -
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated with minor injuries they suffered during protests.
In the independence-seeking region, there remains a great deal of tension a year after the referendum of 1 October declared Madrid illegal, but Catalan separatists celebrated it.
A large majority of the voters chose independence, but the participation was low, because the opponents of the tearing off of the vote largely boycotted.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to prevent the continued voting of voting rooms throughout the area.
The independence groups camped outside Friday night to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believed that Catalonia would achieve independence.
“We survived one of the best moments last year.
My parents were crying from happiness that they could vote, but now we are stuck,” he says.
Although Catalan political parties demanding independence in regional elections last December achieved a tight (but important) victory, this year they are no longer able to successfully continue. Many of their most famous leaders have gone to exile themselves or are waiting in custody of the trial for their participation in the holding of a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming protests to support police by phone, says politicians on both sides contributed to the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced Saturday that he will be running for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repressions shown by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for car crash at home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit the house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the building itself was damaged.
In addition, there could have been a shot at the car from the bow.
Mengo's goal was to win Livingston over Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga is the first goal for Livingston to win
Newbie Livingston shocked Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard only a second loss in 18 matches since he joined the Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's intervention proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team reached the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is still out in the Premiership this season, and next Sunday, he will be his rival leader Hearts, behind whom he is eight points behind.
Before that, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended his series of unbeatability in the league to six matches. The lead coach Holt, who last month replaced Kenny Miler, has not yet experienced the patience of losing.
Livingston's chances of burning off against the screamed guests
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge long before the goal.
Scott Robinson ran away, but his attempt went to the gate, and Alan Lithgow's ending was just next door when Craig Halket's head in front of the gate.
The locals calmly let Rangers play in front of themselves because they knew that they could cause problems from standard situations.
And that's how a decisive goal fell.
A free kick was played against Rangers and Livingston managed to penetrate, Declan Galluher and Robinson found Mengu after the combination and scored the penalty area on Wednesday.
At that time, Rangers dominated the ball, but they could not overcome home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was most of the time out of work.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to take action.
Scott Pittman's attempt to stop the goalkeeper's feet, Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow ended another standard situation in Livingston next to him.
In the 16th of Livingston, the centers were constantly headed, and the defense was constantly turned away. The players doubled the penalty - after Halkett's intervention on the alternating Glenn Middleton and on the alleged hand - but the referee was allowed to continue the game.
\"Fenomenal - Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and the result of Livingston.
All players as one man were exceptional. On their way up they continue to exceed expectations.
The style of the game and the players in the team have hardly changed since returning to the highest competition, but Holt deserves great recognition for how the team has raised since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredible, driving perfectly organized defense, while Menga didn't let the whole game breathe out to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They played very well under Gerrard, but they did not reach that level.
They missed the final pass - only once they got behind the home defense - and for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it's a raised warning finger.
Erdogan has not received only a warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) the leaders of Turkey and Germany shared breakfast in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, and the aim of the visit is to correct relations between NATO allies.
The dispute was brought about by human rights issues, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside Turkey.
Police said it prevented a group of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters nearby who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of them were Kurdi) have also condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Protracted protests show the diversity of views on this guest. Some German Turks call him a hero, while others condemn him for autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: the death of a cyclist after a crash with a car
After a car crash, a cyclist died in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 a.m. of British summer time near the intersections of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street. This is a busy journey in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver stopped the car and the doctors arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The accident occurred only a few months after another cyclist was brought to death by the driver, who escaped from the scene of the accident. This accident became on Childers Street, about 1.5 kilometers from the Saturday accident.
Metropolitan police said police were trying to identify and inform relatives.
There is a closed road on the site, a diverted bus transport, and motorists were advised to avoid the areas.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Six prison guards were injured in a high-level male prison, according to a report from the prisons.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British summer time at the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire and continue.
The people of the Tornado Special Forces were called to take control of the riots. There are eight prisoners responsible for them, who were able to be separated into one wing.
The guards on the site treated minor injuries of the face.
A prison spokesperson said: “We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to resolve the ongoing incident at the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees treated injuries.
In prisons, we do not tolerate violence and we want it to be clear that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, and they can wake up beyond the bars for longer.
There are more than 500 prisoners in the Long Lartin prison, including the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, a report appeared that the prison director ended up in a hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
Last October, an anti-terrorist unit was also called to the prison to end serious riots, and prisoners attacked the guards with billiard balls.
For Hurricane Rosa, severe floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City are threatening to profit from drought-affected areas.
Tropical pressure, which in Arizona is an exceptional phenomenon. However, it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is directed through the desert south-west, bringing with it the risk of severe floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued an alert to flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays for the area from Western Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, with her announcement of rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones within a radius of 320 kilometers from Phoenix had the status of a tropical storm or a pressure storm from 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 kilometers of Arizona’s border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center are forecasting 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall, while in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona it can be in some places up to 15 centimeters.
In other areas of the desert south-west, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall between 25 and 50 millimetres, exceptionally it can be up to 100 millimetres.
In places where floods are not threatened, rain caused by Rosa can be useful, because the area is suffering from drought.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain will probably also be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry period.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to the portal weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first head over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of the Mexican Punta Eugenia and is heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, thus losing intensity.
Therefore, it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening it will reach the Mexican mainland, it will have the power of a tropical storm.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico may be large, which means high risk of floods.
“A total of 75 to 150 millimetres is expected between Baja California and the north-west of Sonora, in some places it may be up to 250 millimetres,” the portal said.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north until she reaches Arizona’s tropical pressure limit early in the morning.
“The greatest danger that is facing Rosa or its remains is a very large amount of precipitation in Baja California, the north-west Sonora, and the desert south-west U.S.,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life to dangerous floods and watering in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys between the ages of 17 and 18 and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy they found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton at about 4 a.m. British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a “stabilized” state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock during the night.
The police are asking all those who have recorded the incident with a mobile phone to come to the confession.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered the anger and anger of the Democratic Party”
“Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejecting the unscrupulous and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said before the meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “suffered the submission and anger of the Democratic Party.”
Kavanaugh said Thursday before Congress that he was violently and emotionally rejected by Christine Blasey-Ford, who had sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also responded to the allegation of the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people had the opportunity to see the uniqueness, character and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“Voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for confirming one of the most respected experts in the field of the law of the present and a lawyer with a perfect history of public service,” he told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in elections in the middle of the term of office.
“There are five weeks left in the elections that are one of the most important in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
“So I’m doing my best to support exceptional candidates.”
Trump said the aim of the Democrats was “to resist and hinder”
The first key procedural vote at the Senate on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected to be on the agenda no later than Friday.
Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunamis have claimed hundreds of dead, the number of victims is rising.
At least 384 people lost their lives, and many took away the waves when huge waves of earthquakes and tsunamis struck by the Indonesian island of Sulawesi arrived at the beaches.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Pala, when they hit the coast on the evening with waves up to six meters high. Waves destroyed everything that stood in their way, and many people came and life.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach. They didn’t run away and became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB).
“Cunami did not come alone. She took cars, beams, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h on the open sea before it hit the coast.
As he said, some people, in an attempt to escape the tsunami, went to the tree and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 resorts in Pala.
Many destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water, have been seen in the aeronautical photographs published by the agency.
On Saturday, there were subsequent shocks in this coastal city.
Several earthquakes have been reported in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technologies (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by a strong Friday earthquake exceeded about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency said the tsunami intensity could increase the location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, business houses and hotels had collapsed.
As he reported, the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that losses on lives and damage could be greater in the Donggala area, which is located 300 km along the coast north of Pala, because the area is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely stunned” and from Donggala “no information is available,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” he said in a statement by the Red Cross.
“It’s a tragedy now, but it can be even worse,” he said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday that it did not inform about the tsunamis in Pala, but the authorities said the waves had arrived at a time when the warning had already been issued.
On an amateur record shared on social networks hear a man on the upper floor of the building, as on the people on the street below shouts desperate warning that he is approaching the tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall came across the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communication with the city of Pala and the surrounding area, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The authorities said the military started sending trucks from Jakarta and other places with help, but the evacuated still urgently needed food and other essential needs.
The city airport was re-opened only for aircraft with help and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of World Vision from Donggala went safely to the city of Pala, where employees were hiding in sailing shelters created in the yard of the office, they walked through the destroyed areas, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many destroyed homes,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups embarked on a difficult task and began to work on disaster recovery, some of them complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to arrive in Pala.
According to the Indonesian regulations, finances, stocks and workers from other countries can only begin to arrive if the disaster is declared a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of the province,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says it’s a national disaster, we can open the door to international aid.
When it occurred in Pala on the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, families and friends of the missing were hoping that their closest ones would be a miracle in the gloomy story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, the rescuers liberated a woman who had been stuck between her mother’s clashes with her body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paraglidists at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, and one of them was Mandagi.
“As I’ve been doing paragliding for a long time, I’ve been carrying my own emotional burden,” he said.
Subandono described how a few hours after the crash report of the Roa Roa Hotel flew past the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp competitors in Pala, who participated in the beach festival.
However, there was only one gray sign of a check on his messages instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 to complete Newport ATM on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning to Brink's, a newport ATM on the Levee, in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver broke out the ATM in this entertainment complex and was about to deposit more money, according to a report by Detective Dennis McCarthy.

Kanye West: reper changes name to Ye
Reper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: \"A flat officially known as Kanye West -
West (41) has been dubbed Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he will present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, he will replace Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for \"citizens\" - said the show's creator.
In addition to being a shortcut to his current artistic name, West in the past declared that this word has religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year when he talked about the name of his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
\"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From the word Kanye, which means “the only one”, only Ye was created. It reflects what is good, bad, confused, everything.
The album reflects more about what we are.
It is another of the famous reps who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also presents himself with a connector without a conjunctivator and with small letters.
Mexican president vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez has solemnly promised that he will never use military force against civilians, because the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliatory against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would “never and under any circumstances use an army to overpower the Mexican people”
On this square on 2 October 1968, the soldiers shot at peaceful demonstrators, killing up to 300 people. It was at a time when left-wing student movements began to promote throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans with monthly subsidies for students and opening up other free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities make young people join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to an investor and promoter of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after artificial intelligence has been expressed by various U.S. government entities, although the U.S. does not have a general formal AI strategy.
On the contrary, China presented its plan last year: by 2030 it wants to be a leader in AI innovation.
“As all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we’re trying to make another breakthrough in AI, the double budget at UI would be a good start,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that we will achieve another big success in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, published this week’s Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading UI-focused companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the UI system, which defeated the top-rated American player named Othello, and later was a executive at Microsoft Research and CEO of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee responded to the previous U.S. State Technology Competitions, such as the Robotic Challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when would be next to help reveal future visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants.
“Academic leaders are not being taken away from us by China, but by large corporations,” Lee added.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired the best brains from universities to work for them on UI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in the field of UI.
“I think the holders of a PhD in UI should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Committee issued its Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations divide money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from the industrial and academic community. The White House declared the creation of a Selection Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
At the same time, this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in UI research.
On the contrary, in the U.S. legislation, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, no activity has taken place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the name of the country to \"The Republic of North Macedonia - This step would resolve the dispute with Greece, stretching for decades, which blocked Macedonia's applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments made an agreement in June involving a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach at least 50 percent of the votes needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum vote was: \"You are a member of the European Union and NATO through the recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece -
The supporters of the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth accepting Macedonia, a country that originated after the end of Yugoslavia, into communities such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for a future for the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the will of the voters and decide on the outcome.
The change of the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no irregularities in the course of the referendum by 13:00.
However, the vote was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place lies in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, voters in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their voting tickets in a Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country, thanks to which she could join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, put a small podium in front of the Parliament in Skopje and attracted chairs in front of tents built by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with a raised head, not a rear entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We may be a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He added that the resulting “yes” would be “confirmation of our future”
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research found that 30-43% of voters are going to vote for a referendum, which is below the threshold of participation.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to leadership in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overcomes all of Brighton’s defense and shoots goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke Brighton's defense and secured a 2:0.
Aguero's elegant goal in the 65th minute looked at first glance to ridiculously easy.
The Argentine attacker accepted a pass at the beginning of the action in the middle of the field.
He was among the three Brighton defenders and ran to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender and then circled a few others on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a pass to the left, where the ball found Sterling.
For the first time, an English attacker touched the ball and sent it back to Aguer, who outperformed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguera has some foot problems,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We’ve been talking about playing around 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what it was.
We were lucky to have a goal at the moment.
But it was Sterling who won the opening advantage for the Cityzens in the Premier League meeting.
His goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero reached the ball deep on Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sanea.
Sane touched the ball a few times and led Sterling towards the distant iron.
The attacker Cityzens pushed the ball into the net just before it came into the car.
The city is going to play with Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 am in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances for Rockies
When the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were not many reasons to force themselves to the next start.
But the immensely competitive Scherzer hopes to stand up against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, though only if it can still result in consequences for the Rockies who have a lead in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of NL.
By winning 5:2 above the Nationals on Friday night, Rockies maintained at least the possibility of a wild card, but still have to confirm their first divisional title.
Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can still get on the pitch with the idea that in the atmosphere here in Denver and with such a crowd and opponent, it will probably be the highest level to which we get to this year.
Of course, I want to experience it -
Nationals have not yet declared the first pitcher on Sunday, but they seem to let Scherzer be thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, threw a bullpen on Thursday and threw it on Sunday, when he normally has a relaxing day.
Washington’s right hand has a 18-7 score of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 of this season’s changes.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly pointed out the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Bretta Kavanaugh, when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the interim elections (Midterms).
“In November, everything we’ve achieved will be at stake.
There are five weeks left to the most important choices of our lives.
It’s a huge, huge opportunity. Even if I’m not running alone, I’m running, so I’m going down the country and fighting for our great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, truly terrible radical group of Democrats, right in front of us.
They are determined to take power back by any means, obscenely and maliciously.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to overestimate to gain power and control. That's exactly what they want, power and control, but we won't give them --
Democrats, he said, set out on a mission to “repeat and hinder”
\"You may have seen it in the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"indignant, mean, evil and false.\"
He mentioned the Senate's Senate Judiciary Committee, the name of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who met with a loud statement from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document escape?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I, wait--her body language was really bad--the worst body language I've ever seen--
Labour is no longer liberal.
They do not tolerate those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists voted for my punishment, it hardly surprised me.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to whom they have said that he is no longer welcome - all for expressing his opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated like this because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, he criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree on with previous leaders.
At an invitation to the Labour meeting for Nottingham on Friday, it was said that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday evening GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today many sessions are not carried in such a tone and promise \"more kind, gentler - politics is long forgotten, if ever paid.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the differences in views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy got into leadership, because colleagues I had previously thought we were sharing a similar political stance suddenly expected to turn 180 degrees and accept views I would otherwise never agree with - whether on the EU's national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there is a tirade of criticism on social media calling for appeals, giving up the policy of Wednesday, and listening to how I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
Of course, I know I’m more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are only used to being political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face and never hide from the gloom of sexist or racist attacks every day.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is that the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer these well-known liberals, and with every incentive to express \"confidence\" or change in the rules of choice, the party is getting narrower and narrower.
In the last two years, many people have advised me not to stand out from the crowd too much, to be silent and to keep up, and then I will be “all right”
But I didn’t get into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the indifference of the government of Thatcher, who committed that my high school class had literally collapsed, I have been trying to promote better public services for those who needed it most - whether in the local ministry or in the ministry.
I have never hidden my policy in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could be confused with my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative on Friday, I would only say that when a country sneaks towards a Brexit that harms households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to address my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have does not belong to the Momentum initiative in Nottingham. It is for the inhabitants of my district, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise you that no threats of appeal or political computation will scare me from trying to enforce what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr is coming to the top
Two late attempts may have been slightly confusing with the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned a triumph in this amazingly engaging game of Tennent's Premiership.
He now found himself at the top of the table as the only unbeatable team of ten.
In the end, victory brought them home a great defense, as well as a better use of chances, and coach Peter Murchie has the full right to joy.
“We’ve done a lot of tests during the matches and we’re left unscathed, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “The hat down in front of Ayr took chances better than we did.
Thanks to Grant Anderson’s 14-minute attempt to turn Frazier Climo into leadership, Ayr got into leadership, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Roy Hughes, whom the Warriors released for the match, allowed Melrose to renumber and Jason Baggot recorded an unaltered attempt.
Climo stretched the lead of Ayr Penalty and then, exactly in half a time, scored solo experiments, allowing Ayr to take a break with the result of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, transformed by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Then followed by a lengthy delay for the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was suspended, and as soon as the game began to continue, Ayr went on to lead the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who transformed Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose used it in the form of an unaltered attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the meeting under strong pressure.
However, the home page relived and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting the Clima without a ball, MacPherson reached touch-down from criminal shooting with the approaching horde of Ayr behind his back.
Climo turned, like almost at the beginning of the action, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregory Henry's wing away at the fifth domestic attempt.
Still Game star embarks on a new career in gastronomy
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, appears to be starting a career in the field of services. According to our information, he was appointed director of the company with a license to operate the restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last and it seems that Kiernan is already planning to live outside the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang (the story of the series).
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in a “a flourishing restaurant business” in Glasgow.
\"More is ours - Bolivia, cut off from the sea, makes hope to restore access to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are besieged by the Navy in La Paz, dressed in sails.
There are blanky blue flags on public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titika to Amazon are covered with the motto: “More is our right.
Getting it back is our duty.
In the whole of Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coast is lost in favor of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century still alive - as well as the desire to regain the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Now, the hope is perhaps the highest in recent decades, after five years of hearings, Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October.
“Bolivia is on the rise, has a spirit of unity and balance, and of course believes in a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia’s diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court on large screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia, so that after decades of suspended negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate to provide sovereign access to the Bolivia Sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who will take part next year in the controversial struggle for re-election, also has something to say about Monday’s decision.
“Our return to the Pacific Ocean is within reach,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and if so, much would not change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate the territory of Chile and said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court’s statement comes only six months after hearing the final arguments suggests that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chinese international law expert.
And although there is no doubt about Bolivia’s arguments, it is possible that in recent years it has taken a step backwards.
“The question of access to the sea was taken by the current Bolivian government,” Zarate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric undermined all remaining acceptance of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue the negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain a dialogue.
The countries have not been embassies with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making would be unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements and achieve mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime question as a political barrel.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea rejects nuclear disarmament until it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not get rid of nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep its promises at the Singapore Summit among rival leaders.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the threshold of restoring diplomatic negotiations on a nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Uno over three months after Singapore.
Ri says it’s an illusion to think that US sanctions and protests against a declaration that would end the Korean war could put the North on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang thinks of a serious resignation from the arsenal, which the country is very likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion shows the latest trends in impressive head covers, which you will soon find in your store
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself perfectly from the sun, you no longer need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their Spring/Summer 19 collection on the pier a whole range of unusual oversized head covers that stunned viewers at the Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their shocking creations to the demonstration pier.
Valentin's unique piece was a bulky beige hat decorated with a paper roof that covered the model's heads.
Other additions of excessive size include a melon lined up with precious stones, a witch hat, and even ananas, but they aren’t meant to warm you up.
Thom Browne also performed a selection of bizarre masks - exactly on time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewn lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear, even with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a cobblestone with melt ice cream.
And if you like bold fashion expressions - you're lucky.
Style experts predict that huge hats will also get into common stores around you.
The extra-dimensional hats follow the inspiration of “La Bomba, a straw hat with a roof of 60 centimeters, worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
The iconic brand behind a highly impractical hat lurking behind every corner of social media sent another great creation to the pier - a straw beach bag almost as large as a model dressed in a swimwear that carries it.
The Rafia bag of tanned orange color, bordered by reef traps and complemented by white leather ear, was a unique piece of the La Riviera Spring/Leto 19 collection from the Jacquemus brand on the Paris Fashion Week.
A celebrity stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to come into the regular shops next summer - as the designer had such a tremendous impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra-dimensional accessories -
John Edward: Without language skills, the global citizen will not be treated
Scottish independent schools maintain excellent academic results and continue this trend in 2018 with another year of extraordinary test results, which further strengthens individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare pupils for further and higher education, careers according to their ideas and a place in the world as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement school curriculum tailored, we still perceive modern languages as a popular and sought-after subject at schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you speak to a person in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
When you speak to him in your own language, you speak to his heart.
It is a strong reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the table with the highest average of grades among independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest mark A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved the highest mark A in Mandarin Chinese, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as basic skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today are considered to be as important as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent and other schools.
The UK's 2014 Employment and Skills Commission survey found that 17% of the reasons that employers identified as problems in job occupation were inadequate language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential when preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities arise, which require languages, these skills in the globalized world become essential.
No matter what career a person chooses, as long as he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage with such a lifelong capacity for the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov, between over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak any foreign language enough to be able to chat fluently, while French was the only language in which a lot of people got into double-digit percentages (15%).
It is therefore important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially the languages of developed economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to what languages it teaches.
Some schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from a variety of languages and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools have committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain essential in the global trading environment for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be called “International communication capabilities”
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellent quality for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first game for Los Angeles Lakers will be waiting for you soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be on Sunday in an open-air war against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet decided how many minutes it will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James spoke about his plans for six preparatory Lakers matches.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need preparatory matches to start,” he said.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today launched a series of election meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's planned meetings for next week, including stops in related places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After he abstained from voting for his candidate for a free seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming Midterms elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control in November.
What is Trump's meeting in West Virginia today and where can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is held at 19:00 Eastern time today, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can follow online below, via live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the current hearing of the candidate for the Supreme Court’s judge, Bretta Kavanaugh, who was strained for allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected confirmation vote of the Senate postponed for a week before the FBI’s investigations.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is mainly to help Republicans who expect the challenging November elections to regain strength.
According to Reuters, these five meetings are aimed at “inciting volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
“Controlling Congress is so critically important for his agenda that when he enters a busy election season, the president travels to as many states as possible,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who refused to be named.
Today’s meeting, held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh,” West Virginia Metro News said.
Trump visits West Virginia for the second time in the last month on Saturday, winning more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to support a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, whose poll preferences are lagging behind.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president must come to raise his preferences in surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to fight and hopes for success when entering the Sunday fights of individuals
After three unilateral series, foursome matches can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs on Saturday afternoon.
The fluctuating pendulum of the driving force is a thought-out sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, which side do they think the driving force is on now?
“They’ve led six points, now they’re just four, so we could say that we now have a moderate driving force,” said Jordan Spieth, as he was preparing for his competition day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, a four-point lead and another twelve in the game.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel a slight wind in their sails and have plenty of reasons for hope, among other things thanks to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth was insurmountable from the launch to the last hole and leads others by his example.
As his round progressed, the proud glamorous screams were getting louder, sinking a key bond and the fourth match was indecisive when he and Thomas had two less.
His putt, who won the match at 15, was celebrated with a similar cry that proves his belief that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
“You just have to pull out your sleeves and let go of it, think only of your own match,” Spieth said.
None of the players have left anything else.
18 holes where you have to reach the maximum.
The only players who have reached more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed favourites of the Ryder Cup.
A special but charming European couple has four out of four and has no way of making a mistake.
\"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't shoot bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This round and the way the energy flows between the turbulent crowd and the players confirms that these players will need to be defeated on Sunday, and it is difficult to find a more popular player to consolidate the potential European victory at sunset above the Le Golf National pitch than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best both at the same time in different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the early fourballs when he played in a pair with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine pits made up the Spanish and Swedish pits, from which they were no longer able to dig.
There's no one here on Sunday to help you dig out of the pit.
Fourball and foursome matches are close to fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how the strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better so far as a team and has a significant lead to the final day, but these four-wheels have also shown that the US team is not afraid to fight, some of them, especially on the American continent, have doubted.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe takes 10:6 lead
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a substantial advantage after completing Saturday's four-ball and four-some matches against the United States 10:6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have conducted an attack with two victories over Tiger Woods to credit four points to their Le Golf National account.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in an effort to keep the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the failing American side in the early fourball matches and won the 3-1 series.
In foursome matches, Americans offered more resistance, two matches won, but they couldn’t evaporate their deficit.
Jim Furyk’s party needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to score four points in a row, while, together with Molinari, under the name \"Molliwood\" are only the second pair after the sensational weekend, winning four points in its opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball matches, they excellently fixed their performance and defeated glass Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau for an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliantness, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the morning fourball matches, returned to accompany Henri Stenson in the foursome and together defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - a unit and a trio in the world ranking.
Europe, however, did not have that pleasant, fresh day to the south-west of Paris quite easy.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up a stick for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 on the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball matches and later returned to defeat Poulter and Roy McIlroy 4&3 in foursome matches after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team managed to get out of a four-point deficit when entering individual matches, although Fury's party as a title defender needs only a draw to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to be above their strength.
North Korea “will not unilaterally disarm without trust”
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions have deepened distrust of the United States and that the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the world institution that North Korea has taken “essential steps” in the last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembly of a nuclear test site, and a commitment not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any corresponding response from the US,” he added.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no self-confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s famous complaints against Washington’s gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded in taking steps, his opinion was fundamental in that it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint opinion issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working on “core disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea a security guarantee.
North Korea tried to reach the formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States declared that Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to release strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists first on nuclear disarmament and increases tension rates through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner and even by objecting to the “declaration to end the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions will hit us on our knees is the illusion of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the U.S. president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim Jong Uno and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea had been the other side of the issue of nuclear disarmament instead of the US, disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after \"Mr. Zlo-Trump called Kim \"a rocket on a suicide mission.\"
Trump, who threatened last year that North Korea would “totally destroy” the United Nations, sang praise for Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said there was still a lot of work ahead of him and sanctions had to remain until North Korea was freed from nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had no time schedule for this, saying that “it doesn’t matter whether it lasts for two, three or five months.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue strictly and without exception until we reach complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to narrow down funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not have a good run.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the view that progress had been made, but in a few hours, North Korea condemned him for putting forward \"Gangster's demands.\"
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to disassemble the missile testing site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “corresponding measures”
According to Kim, “the appropriate measures he expected were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalize relations with Washington.”
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
The aim of this year’s Harvard University course is to ensure that all students have more sleep in an effort to suppress the growing trend of study throughout the night with the help of caffeine.
Scientists have found that students at the world’s leading university are often helpless when it comes to the full basics of taking care of their health.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical Faculty and specialist of the Brigham and Feminine Clinic, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to set up the course after a lecture that led to sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, “Why do I find out about it now, in the last year?”
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me,” said The Telegraph.
The course, which took place this year for the first time, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and sports performance while improving general health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and Executive Director of the University’s Health Service, said the university decided to open a course when it found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the working week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of the dormitory room where students can click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light and how lack of sleep affects sports performances and how important a regular sleep regime is.
In the next section, participants will learn how a long-term sleep deficit can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The university campus map with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about it - just as everyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture in which students are proud of being able to learn all night long, he says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” - students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even against weight gain, because the sleep deficit gets the brain into a starvation mode, so they constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending one of his seminars last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to push the course at the university level.
He hopes that in the next step it will be possible to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before they go into a challenging study.
Prof. Czeisler advises students to set an alarm clock even for the time when they are supposed to go to bed, as well as for the time when they are supposed to wake up, and to realize the harmful effects of “blue light,” which emit electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which leads to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 : 0 Rangers: Mengov goal sung by Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of sadness outside when Dolly Mengu shot the cast-out team of Steven Gerrard to lose 1-0 in Livingston.
The guests from Ibrox tried to record their first victory outside from February 4:1 in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt’s team brought Gerrard only his second defeat for 18 matches in the role of manager and left his team at 8 points from the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, which are Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-life, and the Rangers report, which lacked inspiration, did not even approach the settlement.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth, Livingston climbs to third and leaves Hibernian with only one goal behind.
And Rangers may also have other problems after the bar referee Calum Spence suffered a head injury because he was hit by an object apparently thrown out of the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team and then the Rangers outperformed Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt left the same eleven Livi, who last week took the Hearts point, and was excited about how his well-assembled team suffocated its opponents in every action.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were supposed to score only in the second minute of the match when the first Menga appeal from the field sent Scott Pittman to the gate of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder wasted his big chance.
A long straight kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was able only to miss the back bar by far.
Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have hope in their game rather than conviction.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the right to pay after a quarter of the game when he collided with Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed only two shots on the target in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely brought out of the Lassan Coulibaly's head and a short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opening goal of Livi in the 34th minute may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can argue that they deserved it only for their efforts.
Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' horn again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Dallas moved the ball with Scott Robinson’s scratch, who kept his cool head and chose Mengu to finish.
Gerrard took a break, exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate impact when the winged attacker found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was in a hurry from his line and blocked him.
But Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the type of game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett shot one long ball after another.
Holt's side could stretch its lead in the final stages, but McGregor well defended Jacobs and then resisted Lithg's wide head from the corner.
The Rangers substitute, Glenn Middleton, later claimed a penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson missed it again.
Chronicles: The Inventor of Geiger's Computer
And now we have a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactiveity, an invention that eventually led to the construction of a device known as the Geiger computer.
Geiger's computer, in addition to being an integral part of science to this day, also became a pop culture stand when they talked about it in a 1950 film, \"Bells of Coronado - Cowboys Who Drived to Science, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: \"What the hell is this--
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s computer, it detects radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you really hear the sounds of atoms that create radioactiveness in minerals.
Evans: “I really can hear them crack.”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to \"see\" weight cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see and kill” the malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells in treatment
The method involves extraction of immune cells from the patient and their adjustment in the laboratory
They “see” protein common in many types of cancer and inject it back.
The vaccine tested shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient extracts immune cells, adjusts in the laboratory to “see” protein common in many types of cancer, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer,” explained Prof Berzophy.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and their \"teaching\" - how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West, with the MAGA cap on his head, became the target of criticism for Trump's support after his performance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was featured on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance, singing to U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song called Ghost Town, during which he had a hat on his head with the inscription Make America Great, he embarked on an attack against the Democrats and stressed his support for Trump.
“I spoke to a white man so many times and said to me, ‘How can you recognize Trump, because he’s racist?’
Well, if racism bothers me, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday Night Live (SNL) show began with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made a mockery from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate’s court committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West’s speech was not broadcast, Comic Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to make West laughs with his sharing.
West also complained to the audience that he had experienced difficult moments behind him for his hat.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t put your hat on your head.”
I was normally bullied!
And then they told me I was down,\" Washington Examiner said.
West continued: “Do you want to see how I am at the bottom? I will put on my superman mantle because that means no one will tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love -
His comments earned a babbling from the audience at least twice, and others performing in the SNL were embarrassed, said Variety magazine, with one person saying to the media: “In the whole study, the grave silence was dominated -
Westa was invited as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when the song I Love it performed dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
Westa was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “A link for one of the bravest souls: thanks for being against the Davu.
But the moderator of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West “was just himself and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I’m determined not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing brand, or by supporting his “art,” who I believe is accepting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are also,” she added.
Before the launch of the rapper show on Twitter, he announced that he had changed his name and from now on he would be \"Ye - formally known as Kanye West -\"
He is not the first artist to change his name, he continues to follow the footsteps of Diddi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, also had the name Snoop Lion, and there is, of course, the late musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist, formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, condemned toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-armed Jon Snow in the harsh medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones from HBO.
But a 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of a guy hero and said that for such characters on the screen, young boys often feel that they must be harsh to respect them.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he says that “something has gone out somewhere and is thinking about how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Game of Thrones, and also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that the solution to this problem was “very important.”
“I personally feel it’s very important to address where something went wrong in masculinity,” he said.
“What we teach men during adolescence when there is a problem that we now see.”
Kit is convinced that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity for its overly masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What does television teach and what happens on the streets that young boys feel they have to have this particular side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the great questions of our time - how can we change it?
Because it's clear that something went wrong with young men somewhere --
In an interview, he also admitted that when the series ends next summer, there will be no more prologues or continuations to the Game of Thrones, because \"he has already ended with battlefields and horses -
Since November, Kit will play in the new adaptation of the game Sam Shepard the Right West (True West), which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best of the game of Thrones.
“Thanks to this show, I met my wife, so in some sense she gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
In a fantasy series, Emmy played Rose Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the headquarters of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820 000 people are infected in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases have been reported for the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which is a change over the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who were infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But over the years, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still widespread.
As a result of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who had sexual intercourse with a man are eventually married to a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a general approach to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her employee would let the GOP Senators' data escape, criticize \"dangerous lies\" and \"conspiracy theories\"
U.S. MP Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected the allegations that a member of her staff would send the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators to the Wikipedia of the legislator.
The Los Angeles Democrats say the allegations come from “ultravic experts and websites.
“Lie, lie and other detestable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of American senators, Lindsay Graham, from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, with an unknown person posting it on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing of the Senate on allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court’s candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked for a while after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses that identify the source of leaks were linked to Waters' office and provided information about a member of Waters staff, Hill said.
“This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false charges has in no way been responsible for the leak of this information.
This unconfirmed accusation is absolutely false and absolutely false.
Waters’ statement quickly attracted criticism online, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“His denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It means that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not committed, he must not be angry.
It must not behave resistively.
He must not question the applicant’s motives.
He must be calm and balanced.
Fleischer appears to have compared Waters' response to Kavanaugh's criticism of the Democrats who accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs for Waters in the ongoing election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s big,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and will be legally responsible for their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English's Review Intervents Again - Undersized Spy Parody with Rona Atkinson
Nowadays, it is common to look for references to Brexit in every new British-based film, and this also applies to this reincarnation of action comedy parody with Johnny English - which was first released in 2003 by Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 in Johnny English.
Will ironic self-satire become about how obviously we are incapable of a new national export article?
In any case, the incompetence of Johnny English with his distinctive facials gained the opportunity to ruin everything again - with his name signaling better than anything else, that he is a generous comic creation designed especially for non-English viewers.
He, of course, is the clumsy secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims for the subtle glamour, is a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean, and a spoon of that guy who contributed the only tone to the initial song of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character is originally based on an international traveler and a mysterious man, whom Atkinson once played in today's forgotten television commercials on Barclaycard, leaving chaos everywhere.
In this last adventure of Johnny English, one or two nice moments can be found.
I liked how Johnny English came to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the helicopter slightly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is manifested here, but humor sounds a little undersized and strangely superficial, especially when “seriously” movie brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible themselves today already offer comedy as one of their components.
Humor acts as if he was rather targeted at children than adults, and for me, the strange adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson's gagas without words in the submission of Mr. Bean's character.
The current background of the film’s story is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain’s super secret web network of spies, and to scare a service agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately escaped only a small role, revealed the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and fighting character who is already on the verge of collapse for political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does what she can do with Teresa May’s quay, but in the script she has nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that if every active spy has been revealed, she will have to call someone to retire.
Johnny English, employed today as the director in a certain noble institution, gives private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here are some pleasant gags, as English gives espionage lessons in the style of School of Rock.
So English is calling back to Whitehall for an emergency brifing and will meet his former long-time jumper Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, attached to an affected submarine commander, on the role of which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a shame.
So Batman and Robin, who are the masters of the disasters in the secret services of Her Majesty, are back in the full field and come across the beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet in the administration of Olga Kurylenková.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the magic of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: sinister Jason Volt plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd clashes: in a glider for waiters, they set the lit French restaurant on fire; they cause chaos when they smuggle on Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when they try to use a virtual reality device to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volt House.
All the tricks pull out of the sleeve in the last minutes, but whatever they are impressive and stormy, it all acts a little like a TV show for children.
The whole impression is more or less average.
And, like the other Johnny English films, I still have to think about why the British film industry will not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
Labour Denounces Work on a UK Four-Day Workweek Plan Paid As Five-Day
Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn said they should consider a radical plan that the British should have a four-day working week, but were paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company leadership to redistribute savings from the AI revolution to provide workers with extra day off.
It would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but home would wear the same paychecks.
The sources say the idea would \"responsibly\" the economic plan of the party to propel the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: We expect the evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
“It doesn’t happen from evening to morning, but a four-day working week is an effort that corresponds to the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
Labour would not be the first to support this idea. The Green Party included a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party has not yet enforced its efforts as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party’s policy, nor does the party consider it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell stated his determination to regain power from \"anonymous directors\" and \"rich people\" in the field of services.
At the same time, the plans of the shadow office mean that current shareholders in water companies would not get their entire shares back because the Labour government could apply “clashes” due to the crime found.
At the same time, he has confirmed plans to include employees in the board of directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds so that 10 percent of private sector capital can be reached by employees who could receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy said in a 60 Minutes session whether an FBI investigation by Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh abstained from voting for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether the findings of the Office could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
The interview, which was broadcast on Sunday, asked the program rapporteur 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal something they would change their mind about.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“But of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened when the charges were raised, I asked, ‘Have you done this?’
He was determined, determined, and clear.
Graham’s voice seems to be determined.
“I’ve already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and there would have to be some fireless accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one who is named can confirm that.
This thing is 36 years old.
I can't see how something could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it contribute to reducing poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event featuring an impressive crowd of stars with an even more impressive mission: to end world hunger.
In their seventh year, tens of thousands of people will meet on the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If viewers want to get a free ticket (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as voluntary activity, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or other meaningful way to raise awareness of the goal of the event, which is to end poverty.
Is it still 12 years old, as Global Citizen is really doing its best to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism,” when people feel like they are actually making a change when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has seen more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, moving towards different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have helped outburden world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported that 390 commitments and declarations were made from its shares, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
For example, the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and realtors who have committed to “helping children achieve their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after they receive more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can achieve that insufficient nutrition becomes a thing of the past,” said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition benefits.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “Based on what you think we can end extreme poverty”,
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and challenging journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the great movements of civil rights and apartheid before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the personalities who perform at this year’s event in New York, along with the moderators Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a “block” to limit Russian energy exports, says the Secretary of the Interior
“If necessary, Washington may call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East,” U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke said Russian involvement in Syria, where they are acting to invite a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I am convinced that the main reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade in energy exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern stomach of Europe,” he said.
There are ways and methods to deal with this.
“The United States is able to use the Navy to ensure that the seaways remain open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at an event held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that puts itself in the position of \"voice of energy consumers\" in the US.
He further compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic option towards Iran and Russia is more use and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to the fact that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has set out to support the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would make Berlin a “inmate” of Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we have the same view that energy cannot be an instrument for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has brought resistance to Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industry organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), called on the US not to mix in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously think about the presidential candidate in 2020”, says Senator for Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “seriously consider” the presidential candidacy after the ongoing elections.
During a meeting at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that also requires a woman in the top post,” Hill said.
“After 6 November, I will seriously think about the presidential candidate.
Warren said during a meeting at the City Hall that he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a survey published Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center, 50 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidate and 48 opposed.
Other known names among the Democrats, which are referred to in the context of the 2020 potential candidacy, are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Christine Sanders.
Biden said it would officially decide by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, was taken to the Army on 11 September 2007 and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“While passing through my own son, since he returned, I can identify with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and the injuries with which our soldiers are returning,” the state of Oklahoma told viewers at the meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa.
Palin called his arrest “an elephant in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that “they are coming home a little different, harsher, returning to the question of whether people respect what their fellow fighters and fighters and all the other members of the army have given this country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference with a report on domestic violence and possession of arms under the influence of drugs, police spokesman Wasilla said.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday to support the opposition of asylum seekers to the new policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the appellant in Grace v Sessions brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics was not published.
She said her partner “and his sons, members of the violent gang,” had abused her, but the U.S. authorities rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The representatives of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a high number of asylum seekers come, as nations facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 Board of Immigrants decision that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates that principle,” said Amicus curiae.
The representatives further argued that a policy that denied immigrants would harm the U.S. economy because it is likely that they would become entrepreneurs and \"add the necessary labour force.\"
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” the statement said.
Asylum should never be designed to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Pala is doubled and desperate efforts are being made to save those who have survived.
The situation has constantly deteriorated for the rescued.
“It’s very tight,” says Ris Kusum’s 35-year-old mother, while at the same time trying to fluctuate her restless son in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Pala.
“Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The inhabitants began to return to their destroyed homes, to dig into their flooded things, and to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, broke in seams.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures of the spine and shoulder, rested in front of the Pala Army Hospital, where patients treated outside for strong follow-up shocks.
His eyes shed tears when he remembered the feeling when a devastating earthquake shook his hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me to the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're safe -
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” through “propagandistic ads”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of mixing in the U.S. Congressional Elections that take place on November 6th, but China denies the allegation.
According to U.S. officials told Reuters, Trump’s accusations of Beijing trying to mix into U.S. elections are a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalated trade war, in which both parties regulate tariffs for mutual imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade conflict were expected to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which support the Trump Republican Party, both Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in a Sunday’s release of the Des Moines Register, “China has now doubled its bullying by posting its promotional ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the contrary, in a newspaper stand on the streets here in Beijing you will find only limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real image of the diverse views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s problematic economic trajectories, as the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
\"One of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his offer - his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was about.
Analysts warn that for a debacle with Kavanaugh Republicans marries chances in women’s voters
As many leading Republicans support and defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this will be forgiven by them in the upcoming ongoing elections, especially from women.
The emotions accompanying this case were extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said they want to vote.
“These things can no longer be returned,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in an article for The Hill published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the FBI’s request for a recent investigation from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) would be enough to calm down angry voters.
Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” Jean-Pierr, a consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group, told Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted in the Senate corridors \"November is approaching - when Republicans in the Judicial Commission decided to continue the Kavanaugh candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony,\" Mic said.
“Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will overcome all boundaries,” said the news portal Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say that motivation is already high; and that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who do not like the president, but often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she reported details of her allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a sharp response if the Republicans confirmed his support.
“For the GOP, this has become one major chaos,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Commission at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just a vote by the Commission or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it’s about how the Republicans stand up to it and how they behaved,” said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priority Group, who is helping to vote for Democrats.
However, it seems that Americans are divided about who to believe in at the dawn of the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with favor tending to Ford.
A new survey from YouG shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford said before the Senate’s court committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court’s candidate exposed her genitals when they attended a party during a study at the University of Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world-wide web, is launching a startup that will want to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, called Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who has access to individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to “control the world”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up.
\"It's a historic moment -
The Solid app allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and work tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, and they’re all available on a single browser.
On personal online data storage, it is unique that only the user decides who will have access to individual types of information.
The company calls this “strengthening personal powers through data”
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s goal is to bring resources, process and skills that will make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on the project and a community of voluntary encoders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to start creating their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google whether they will make a complete change that will completely flip all their business models in the night or not.
“We don’t ask them for permission.
According to Berners-Lee, “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in discussions about network neutrality.
Inrupt remains Berners-Lee founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I see the next era of the web very optimistically,” Berners-Lee added.
Princess Bernard Vann: celebrations of the bearer of the Victorian Cross during World War I
The only Anglican priest to whom they granted the Victorian Cross during World War I was celebrating their 100th anniversary in their hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Rev. Bernard Vann received the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned of the highest British military honor.
In a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren revealed a memorial board on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said he was \"excellently symbolic - that the board is revealed exactly 100 years after the award-winning heroic struggle of his grandfather.
According to the London Journal, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his flag through Canal de Saint-Quentin \"through very thick fog and with strong fire of field weapons and machine guns -
Later, he rushed through the fireline and with “highest braveness” he led the soldiers forward, removing three of the field weapons himself.
Lieutenant Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions “are something I’ll never even approach in my life, but it’s a feeling of deep humility in me.”
Together with their brother, Dr. James Vanna, they put a wreath at the conclusion of the procession, which led the musical ensemble Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that “he felt very honored when he could take part in the procession,” adding that “the splendor of a real hero demonstrates the support that many people express to him.”
The fans of the MMA waited late until the night to conclude Bellator 206, and instead got the series Piglet Peppa
Imagine staying up all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206 finals and you won’t see the main event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 matches, including six majors, and was broadcast live in the UK throughout Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were supposed to face each other, the audiences in the UK were shocked when Pig Peppa appeared on the screen instead of the transmission.
Some were really disappointed because they waited until morning especially because of this match.
One Twitter fan described switching to a children’s fairy tale as “a sick joke.”
“It’s a government regulation that this content was inappropriate from 6 a.m., so it had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked for transmission.
“Yes, it was Peppa’s pig.”
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they would be working to allow viewers to watch their broadcasts in the UK in the future.
“When I think about repetitions, I think we’ll be able to solve it somehow,” said Coker.
“But it’s Sunday at six o’clock in the morning, and we won’t be able to solve it sooner than Sunday of our time, that is Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it went over, we exchanged a lot of messages and they weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise that this will not happen again next time.
We cut it into five matches instead of six - as we normally do - we tried to give the fans something more and we pulled it up.
It's an unfortunate situation -
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “the least valuable” for his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper in water, says he felt less valuable than others when he was growing up - but that's what motivated him to become successful.
A 24-year-old athlete said that only in high school did he realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, moderated by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to add “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of the long-lasting show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off for the disease.
In his first show with Laverne Daley, he said that he felt “less than everyone else during adolescence because it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls to like each other.”
In his own words: “To this day, I really felt less valuable and different, and this gave me the strength and motivation to achieve success.”
You wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone after they learned about his sexuality.
The double-bronze Olympic medalist has become a leading LGBT rights fighter and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give this “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man, the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “surprisingly, it surprised him.”
Daley married an Oscar wearer last year, who is 20 years older, but says the age difference for them has never been a problem.
“When you survive so much at a young age, he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer, “it’s hard to find a peer who would experience similar successes and unhappiness.”
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Next was born to them, and Daley said that his “full view of the world” had changed.
“If you asked me a year ago, I would only talk about how I need to get a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the idea of death and one of the last things he asked him was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him, Dad, you won’t be here anymore so you could sit first,” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that that’s what I’ve been dreaming about all my life, jumping in front of the local audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
The story also inspired his selection of the song, The Stream by Heather Small, who impressed him in preparing for the Olympics and still causes him a cold.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in weak form set on the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to show up in better form so that he doesn’t have to be an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who has been playing at a two-year event for a record 12th time, sat down by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday’s Fourball and Foursome matches.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as many times before for the US, the five-time winner spent the day alternately encouraging and improving his game in the hope of repairing his reputation.
The 48-year-old player did not shoot the most direct at the top of his career, which is not ideal for the tight field of Le Golf National, where in the long field, the faulty shots will usually be ousted.
And as if the pitch itself were not a sufficient challenge, Mickelson faces the ninth match on Sunday, the exact champion of the British Open, Francesc Molinari, who, in a pair with newbie Tommy Fleetwood, managed to win all the matches this week.
If Americans who are behind four points before the start of 12 individual matches succeed in a good start, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely key.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, clicked on my back, caught me around his shoulders and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has high self-confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has made a significant contribution to our teams this week.
I couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I imagined more, but this is how it crystallized, and we felt that this was exactly how we had to do it.
He wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Falda's record at the highest number of matches played on the Ryder Cup.
It could be the conclusion of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual balance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draw, although Furyk says his presence has brought some incalculable values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion,” he explained.
“I think even younger players enjoyed a lot of fun with him and it was great to see it.
His contribution is not only in his game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that strong leadership can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from his own experience that a significant lead at entering individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer debuted at the 1997 match in Valderram, where the team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but still got through the finish line with the tightest possible victory 141-2:13-2.
“I constantly have to remember how we had strong leadership in Valderram; we had strong leadership in Brookline where we lost, and we won in Valderam, but only so,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after the 2018 team won 5:3 on Friday and yesterday led to Le Golf National with a score of 10:6.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that the game is not over yet.
We'll go to full gas tomorrow.
We'll get on the lawn and do everything we need to.
While there are no points on the board, the match is not over.
We have our goal, and in this way it is to win this trophy, we must focus on that.
As I say from the beginning, I’m focusing on 12 players on our side, but I’m also well aware that we’re standing up against the other side, against the best players in the world.”
He was excited about how his players were doing on the challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have preceded events.
We have another fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow it will be individual performances, and that is something completely different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with your partner when you’re doing well, but when you’re there, it’s going to test all your golf skills.
This is a message that players need to remember to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he must go and get the best out of himself -
Unlike Bjorn, co-worker Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than individuals, as they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the big tournaments on the last day when he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up defeated when Europe achieved “A Miracle in Medina”
“I remember every damn word,” he said in an answer to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players until the last day in 1999.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you’d like to start quickly as you’ve seen it in Brookline, as you’ve seen it in Medina.
When this driving force starts in one direction, those middle games matter extremely much.
We created our line-up and placed the boys in a way that made us feel like we were trying to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to fight and facing Roy McIlroy in the highest match, while the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, are in the top half of the order.
“I went with this group of boys in this order, because I thought we’d go all this way,” Bjorn said of the choice of his individuals.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again.
Local media reports that the latest frigate of the German Navy was expected to be put into service in 2014 as a replacement for the aging warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and the build-up of costs.
The launch of “Rheinland-Pfalz, the leader of a completely new class of Baden-Württemberg frigate,” was delayed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was expected to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered from worrying problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come as a substitute for the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known to include a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secrecy technologies such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periodicity - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships that allowed Germany to prove power overseas will become obsolete as soon as they enter operation, the Die Zeit newspaper reports.
Last year, the frigate F125 came to the newspaper when the German Navy officially refused to bring the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the builder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the causes of the return, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware errors” that caused the warship to be unusable when deployed on a combat mission.
The software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class vessels will operate a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the workforce on the older Bremen frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" is considered twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project becomes a problem, including the training of the crew.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original €2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important given the recent warning that German maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defense committee, confirmed that the Navy “does not actually have ships capable of deploying.”
The government official said the issue was packed over time because the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
National Trust reveals the secret life of bats
The new research, which takes place in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how bats use the country in their food hunting.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future nature conservation activities.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by bats of stark and bats sanding, as well as a hook of bright and water bats in Inverewe gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders place on key sites around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The employees of this organization and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of calls of bats and activities of individual species.
Then they create a map of their natural environment and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior to a large extent.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes to reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help determine the benefits of work in the field of environmental management, such as the formation of meadows and how to best preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development works that have an impact on grassland growth and environmental loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks can also be a danger.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are like eyes when it comes to prey hunting.
They use a sophisticated technique of echolocation to accurately determine insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, assembly inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization even founded the first and only reserved protected area for bats on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
Property manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal territory for them.
“We have an amazing space for bats in Threava,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many protected trees and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It emphasizes the importance of controlling bats before performing maintenance within the property, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of a single kindergarten could kill up to 400 females and adolescents, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, disturb or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate in the aid.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we just don’t know how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers filed an action against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls allegations of rape “false news” and says people want to “exploit” with his name.
His lawyers filed an action against the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were charged with rape by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Then he reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
A few hours after the allegation, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers during a live Instagram interview, calling the allegations “false news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said today is fake news,” said the winner of the Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to be visible with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
“I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit for Der Spiegel magazine for allegations that they have called “an unacceptable report of suspicions in the area of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for “moral damage equivalent to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at Clark County County District Court in Nevada, they were reportedly going back to the player’s room after meeting at Ronaldo’s Nightclub and Mayorga, where she was reportedly sexually raped.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was on “99% good guy” who failed by “one percent.”
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “serious for revenge” and feared “public humiliation”
A 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to reassess the deal because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining the Real Madrid team from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian giant Juventus with an agreement worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “permanently regret” if it lost its status as world leader in automotive production after Brexit, trade secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “disturbing” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border crossings if there was a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
The Burnaston plant, produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small race in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just in time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars made to order.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the borders, which could lead to delays and lack of components in the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than daily stock in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's plan on future relations with the EU was \"precisely calibrated to prevent these border controls.\"
“We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to talk about today’s success, but to take this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would stop, but it warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Trade Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: \"We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU -
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, says White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “lay for the next week” because the fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, investigating Russian interference with the election, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the potential campaign of an investigation by the president.
Whether Trump is fired or not by a Deputy Attorney General, and thus threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington has been missing for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of listening to Trump and appealing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House, and new information appeared that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York City.
Trump said he “d rather not throw Rosenstein,” but then the meeting was delayed to avoid encounters with a hearing from the Senate court committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of undue sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The term was not set for this, it could be this week, I understand the shift to another week, given all the other things that happen with the Supreme Court.
We will see and always like to inform the press -
Some reporters denied this claim: Sanders did not hold a short press conference of the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of short press coverage was not due to resistance to TV reporters who wanted to dazzle, although she said: \"I disagree with the fact that they want to dazzle -
Then she suggested that a direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president makes more meetings based on the concept of questions and answers than any other president before him,” she added without giving evidence: “Let’s look at these numbers.”
Short press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to ask a question directly to the President of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do it often and in the last few weeks you have seen us really often, a short press meeting will take place when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open meetings or press conferences with guest rankers.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, when he arrived freely and several times bizarrely before the journalists gathered.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in the National Health Service in Scotland for Brexit concerns
The health secretary wrote to EU staff working in the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish they would remain after the end of Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay the cost of requests for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on the departure process towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the benefits of every employee regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide colleagues bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was forced to undergo an urgent operation after a head injury on Saturday, 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team.
Tennessee State Reed, head coach, told reporters that he was injured shortly before the half-life.
“He came to the sideline and somehow collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put it on the carrier and took it for further examination.
Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was in Vanderbilt after an operation.
Harris added that there are “no details about the type/range of the injury” and the Tennessee State team is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student at the University, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he had five total interventions, which brought him a total of 18 interventions this season.
Foreign buyers will charge higher stamp fees when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK, thereby obtaining additional cash, according to the new Conservatives’ plans, to help homeless people.
This move neutralizes Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
Increased stamp tax will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
State Treasury expects to rise to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers will charge higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK. Additional cash will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success towards attracting young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing and high-income target people.
The increase in stamp tax will be collected from individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, additional funds will support the government in the fight against street sleep.
A surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and property for rent after purchase, could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built properties in London are bought by residents who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy real estate for the first time to get into the housing system.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become “the cities of spirits,” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the earrings to help young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices high by fighting for land, but not using it, and urged May to abandon quotas for affordable housing to correct the British “habitat of housing”
Corbyn announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and “no fault” eviction.
At the same time, it wants to give the committees more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would devote my job to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
This means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build lives.
However, we cannot admit that for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as for companies based abroad, it is as easy to buy houses as for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the unworthyness of sleeping on the street remains too real.
Jack Ross: “My main ambition is to drive Scotland.”
Sunderland football team chief Jack Ross says his “final ambition” is to become Scotland’s manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the League One competition, three points from first place.
Last summer, he moved to the Stadium of Light after moving to the Premiership in Scotland with St Mirren last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baby hat and it was,” Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“As a child, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that has always drawn me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I’m successful in managing the club.
Sunderland’s predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic, a former team leader, says he doesn’t feel any fear that there are such recognized names in such a big club because he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town teams.
“For me, success will be measured by being able to ‘return this club to the Premier League’.
Because of the structure and equipment this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“To get there is not an easy task, but I would probably consider myself a success if I could only get a club there.”
Ross is only three years in his management post after he served as assistant boss in Dumbleton and a 15-month shift from coaching staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Team Alloa recover from the descent to the third league and changed the St Mirren team from the edge of the descent to the winners of the title of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever before during his career in Hyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real journey,” he reminded the Alloa team.
“I really believe that management is more appropriate to me than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I did well, secured an adequate standard of living and enjoyed some reasonable maxims.
Playing can be difficult.
There are many things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but in management I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to drive, and now I’m doing it, so I’m convinced that I’m in the right place, like never before, throughout my adulthood.

Analysis reveals that the perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 pm
Summer heat increased sales in British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data revealed that the pubs and bars sector had a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but sales in restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor, who compiled the data, said: “The continued solar weather and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar trend as the previous month, June, when the pub sales increased by 2.8%, except for restaurants that were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant services in June only deteriorated in July.
Guests with a drink and bar were much better off than restaurants, which took into account the same factors.
Food-offers also saw a decline, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go for a drink.
Within managed pubs and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6% this month, with food falling by three percent.
RSM analyst Paul Newman said: “These results are continuing the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales on the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the year-on-year decline in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful due to the continuing pressures on costs.
The long hot summer could not come for operators with a food offer at a worse time, and the time will show whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed relaxation -
The overall growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new open operations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in branding.

Research reveals that one in five children, some under the age of 11, has secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Instagram accounts”
News raises concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that will show parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, create social media accounts they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils revealed the rapid growth of “false Instagram accounts”, a photo-sharing site.
Reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they run a “main” account that shows parents, while having a private one.
One mother who encountered the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to rape her.
A study conducted by the UK’s Digital Awareness Organization and the HMC’s Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools found that 40% of the population aged 11-18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Committee at the Annual General Assembly of the Managing Body.
Doyle is the most successful athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described this as a great opportunity for those who manage sports to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has huge respect between Scottish, British and world athletic communities, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit by bringing it to the board of directors,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as a voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and, together, has four Olympic gold medals, and who is a regular BBC commentator, has overcome a transient ischemic attack and can’t walk now.
He tweeted: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors have said that only time will show if I will recover and to what extent.
It’s an exhausting job, but I’ve managed to heal completely, I’ve learned to walk again, and today I’m doing agility exercises.
Thanks for the encouraging news -
Advertising for breast milk extractor comparing mothers with cows divides opinions in the online world
The breast milk extractor company has divided opinions in the online world with advertising that compares nursing mothers with dairy.
To mark the launch of “the quietest wearable breast milk extractor in the world,” Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by a poměhúd music video to demonstrate the freedom given by the new pump to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a dream-filled barn with cows for a song that contains lyrics like: “Yes, I take out milk, but you don’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed it’s not grounded, it’s my breasts.”
“I pump, pump, feed so babies, pump, pump, drain my beauty.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, opened a controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video in the viewers raised mixed reactions, with many saying that it disdains the “threats” of the dairy industry.
“A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just as we need to get pregnant and give birth in order to make milk, except that we steal my children within a few days of giving birth,” one woman wrote.

Another user commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both the mother and the young.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk extractors for mothers who keep their children?
Someone added: “Advertising from reality.”
Others advocated advertising, while one woman admitted that the song seemed “successful” to her.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a pump if I were still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping milk.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I take it as it is.
“It’s a brilliant product,” one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “Mother-focused entertainment advertising that drains milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.”
This is not advertising that praises or assesses the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet breast pumpers.
The concept of the campaign is based on understanding the essence that many women who take out milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvia breast milk extractor is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding, giving women the freedom to move, the ability to hold children and even take out and spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarina, a partner and mother in Early Childhood Development, commented: “Elvie breast milk extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative marketing.
By rendering parallels between the expression of women and dairy, we wanted to place in the centre of attention the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while in a fun and eloquent way demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new dehumidifier will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie has appeared in the headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the demonstration pier for designer Marta Jakubowska, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved peacefully to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased, although monthly crossings across borders remained relatively unchanged, in part because the hard rhetoric and procedures introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to place children thanks to supporters.
Traditionally, most of the supporters were illegal immigrants themselves and feared that they would threaten their own ability to stay in the country by making claims to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Officer Matthew Albence said in a statement before Congress that the office had arrested dozens of people who asked for support from minors without accompaniment.
The Office later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of the supporter’s household are illegal in the country, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we continue to monitor these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
Officials who are trying to deal with child-related matters more quickly have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, and not after 60 days as per the previous standard, say the staff in the shelter.
Many will present themselves through a video conference call, not in person, to present their case in connection with the legal status of an immigration judge.
Those who will be classified as not eligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to fall into anxiety or depression, which may lead to an outbreak of violence or attempts to escape, officials said in a shelter and reports that appeared in the system in recent months.
Defenders said these concerns are increasing in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where symptoms of a child suffering are more overlooked due to the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to get emotional preparation or say goodbye to friends could cause trauma many struggled with.
Syria will tell the US, French and Turkish “occupiers” to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who turned to the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “we will treat them accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost at the end of Syria, with more than 360 000 people dying since 2011, with millions being expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “a battle in this sacred battle until it clears all Syrian territories, from both terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria who, in particular, train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were appropriate for their return and accused “some Western countries,” of “proliferating irrational fear,” which led refugees to stay away from home.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no recovery aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement reversed a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had “clear terms” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who would “remove”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of governmental and opposition members in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to \"review of the articles of the current constitution\" and warned against interventions.
Why Trump Gets a Second Functional Period
With this logic, Mr Trump would win the re-election in 2020, although a number of liberal viewers probably hope his presidential office will end the charge and the scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential office at all”!
So far, there are no signs of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, the average follow-up to CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the main broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and “The show with Rachel Maddow has a top rating with up to 3.5 million viewers on the main news evenings.
\"This is a pilgrim that attracts people because it's not something we understand,\" said Neal Baer, the creator of the dramatic program \"President in order - on the ABC about the secretary of government, who will become the president after the attack that destroys the Chapter.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy and show author Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembers driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, “Because he’s funny,” Scovell told me.
There is a fun value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade’s dispute whether immigrants’ families will be able to reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
However, it is already beyond an informed citizen, when you find that six hours you are following an interview by a group of experts about “a deeper background” as the source of the book “Fear” from Bob Woodward, Paul Manafort’s bomber leather jacket from the ostrich valued at $15,000 (“a thick piece of clothing with arrogance”, Washington Post said) and the consequences of the turbulent descriptions, hm, Mr. Trump’s anatomy, according to Storm Daniels.
For example, I will never look at Super Maria in the same way.
“Part of what he does reminds you of a reality show that feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the daily broadcast of a Trump show with a repeating part of the show and everyday storytelling (driving a fight with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you'd be late.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 26 degrees of sunshine outside of the northern coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away from it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was put before the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” said Mr. Fleiss.
“I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out they were right.

Money from the outside flows into the mid-term chair election
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts, which resulted in the struggle for one chair of two candidates.
This recently redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his chair in another district in special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapd with the new 17th district.
The maps were remade after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th district affected the funding of the campaign between the main party financial weapons, the Congress Committee on the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March Special Elections to the 18th Congress District in Pennsylvania.
He held the Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political commentators gave Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. considered penalizing Salvador instead of supporting China, then resigned
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a small distance from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until the partners moved the Trump-led organizational team.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to appeal U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions no longer recognized by Taiwan,” said a spokesperson for the ministry, Heather Nauert, in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were taken into account only against El Salvador, which received aid in 2017 of an estimated $140 million, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in order to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively end any assessment of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now dealing with a conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the assembly that the administration has given him, diplomats said.
Three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new serious reports or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the debate to Mr Bolton, described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations under conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke under the conditions of maintaining anonymity.
Study History
Another unexpected event could be the report by Special Advisor Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to the justice of President Trump, which now has very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller also reportedly turns his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was associated with Russia in an attack on our elections.
If Congress had changed the party, Mr Trump would have faced responsibility in this body just as he was preparing to go again before the voters and perhaps even the jury of his members of the House.
That’s a lot of conditions if I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, or its equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice of how it can affect the extension of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler, but the West would have to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed and missed the opportunity to avoid the year of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflex points and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a few of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation fate?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the report announced that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his inability to execute the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly requested F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair or if it is accepted by the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the term of office in Congress, which will take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will be imposed on a fairly long winter sleep.
I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles on the Sabbath on that table with a hook cross.
With such a past, I just have to be an optimist.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers feels optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers team is hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and they know that the victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the G-group in the Europa League competition.
The knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from presenting himself for the first time in the season, up to 2:2 against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers team can use this as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We went into the game and believed we could get something and we left with a point.
We may have been able to achieve this at the end, but overall the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed up in the second half and were a better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
Let’s hope we get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last match, but with the fans behind us I’m sure we can push on them and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard due to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a factor in the game why we feel good.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it, we have great training.
Let's hope we push back last season and we'll be successful.
Women Don't Sleep for Fear of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted them to take care of them, few people spoke with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the national study said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they won’t take steps to talk,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationalwide Life Insurance.
Here’s where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t present your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring Your Financial Advisor: Your Advisor can help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term insurance contract, a hybrid life insurance contract that will help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own property, if you have that money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the crisis.
Get a healthcare attorney to identify a trusted person who will oversee your healthcare and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of a legal representative for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs quick medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Read these details in the written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just about money, but also about who will be doctors?” he asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place -

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. Officials said an increase in the number of victims was expected.
As a result of immeasurable communication, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the regent office in Donggala, an area north of Pala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 shocks.
More than 16,000 people evacuated in Pala in the wake of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a regent stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region belonging to the province, had an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main support of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, Pala and Donggala tsunami have hit several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia lies seismically in the Pacific Fire Circle and earthquakes regularly interfere with it.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, North Sumatra, launched on December 26, a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, launching a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, outside of Sumatra, and launched a tsunami with a height of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when it reminded people of the devastation caused by a deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was launched, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of the buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
A 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Saturday for suspicion of domestic violence, interference with the domestic violence report, and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when his friend tried to call the police to report those crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody at the Mat-Su investigation facility and is held on a $500 covered bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in a court on Saturday, saying in his defense that “he’s not guilty, certainly,” the television station said.
Palin faces three A-class offences, which means he could be imprisoned for up to one year and be fined $250,000.
He was also accused of a B-class offence, punished one day in prison and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time they have filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with a domestic attack, interference with a report on the crime of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon, while being intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior with PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake, which hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake has triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity networks and communications networks are not working, with an increase in the number of deaths expected in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media there are videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are trying to punish Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, is a rare punishment that has not been granted for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
On October 31, 30-year-old Saipov used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike route along the West Side highway in lower Manhattan by hitting pedestrians and cyclists on the route.
According to a statement of the opening of the death penalty proceedings filed in the southern district of New York City, if prosecutors want to achieve the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saip’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a serious injury.
For both of these points, the death penalty is awarded according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal investigation jury filed a 22-point charge against Saipov, including eight charges of murder with the intention of extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking,” the prosecutors said, and the way Saipov performed it, described it as “aboved, cruel, and perverse.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoz and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” the report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last granted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but in September 2009 he was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
Last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The married couple was executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of compassion for conscience in the following days and months after the attack.
The investigator said he had a good feeling about what he did, the police said.
According to the charges, Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said they also asked for the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
At the address of the charge, he said he was not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of the confession of guilt and life spent in prison without the possibility of release only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saip's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative member of parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
In a protest at a conservative conference, Nigel Farage solemnly promised to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to \"clash with the unpleasant situation - from Euroskeptics - when one of the members of the parliament of Teresa May's proposed that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Councilman Peter Bone said in March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would “be gone if Mr Farage were Brexit’s secretary.”
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in relieving her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by conservatives with a view of staying in favour of joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister seeks to maintain a compromise plan in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite its resistance to force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between its package and its “chaos”
Mr. Bone said at the meeting of Leave Means Leave that he wanted to suspend the Prime Minister.
He proposed that Mr Farage be involved and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out,” he said.
Parliamentary member Wellingborough added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we need to put off the prime minister.”
He said: “We have not fought in World Wars to be subordinated.
We want to create our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bone rejected the opinion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: \"The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain is completely false.\"
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The average is unpopular with the general public, the opposition won’t vote for it, it’s unpopular with our party and our activists who actually storm the streets and get us first.
Please leave the Prime Minister and start listening.
In a statement to May, she added: “Primemen keep their places when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians must “feel anger if they betray a referendum decision in 2016.
\"This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class,\" he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a statement to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger.”
“We are mobilizing the people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and never let go until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, people marched through Birmingham for staying and then organized a two-hour assembly in the city centre.
A number of activists waved transparent Conservatives against Brexit. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, ridiculed conservatives for security issues with the party application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have information systems and all technologies for a border free of friction and for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “think thoroughly” the president’s candidacy.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would think thoroughly about the candidate for the president.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a city hall meeting on Saturday in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump Campaign in Massachusetts.
It was estimated that Trump could defeat in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting at the town hall since Trump entered the office.
He asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time “for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that’s what a woman in the top post requires.”
Sims shooting from LSU University
Police at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that she had arrested a suspect from shooting basketball player LSU Wayden Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
They posted a video from Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man who was captured on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near the Southern University College College on Friday early in the morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and eventually died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde went to help his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present, had a gun with him and admitted to shooting at Wayden Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
A two-meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge played in 32 matches with 10 startes last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 slots per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the team’s orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has been revealed that the Mercedes commands will play a significant role in the race.
From the best starting position, Bottas got a good start and almost got Hamilton into an unpleasant situation when he defended his position in the first two corners and urged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the boxes and left Hamilton to enter the traffic on the tail of the group, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes went to the boxing stop a little later and went out to Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close overtake, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend himself for the third time after a double stroke.
Max Verstappen began on his 21st birthday from the back row and was in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then he led a large part of the race, holding on to the road and focusing on a quick ending, overcoming Kimi Raikkonen and reaching fourth place.
Finally, he got into boxes in the 44th round, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me walk around.
“The team has done an exceptional job, it has a unique combination of two strong personalities,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not deal directly with the testimony provided by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, instead he noted that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “like, repugnant, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the last days in the Senate when you see anger when you see people who are angry and lazy and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
When you look at the disclosures and the leaks and they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.”
I didn't do it -
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish it?
Remember her answer... you've published a document -- \"Oh, oh, huh?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it -
Okay, wait a minute.
We published... No, we did not publish,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter with details of Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and a letter was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t tell her the story,” Feinstein’s committee said.
“She asked me to consider it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to do.”
However, it seems that her denial did not fit the president, who said during the Saturday meeting: “I’ll tell you what, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but she had the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of three women of unsustainable sexual behavior, the president suggested that Democrats used claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power through all the necessary means.
You see ignominence, indecency, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control,” Mediaite said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals behind Giants against the Dundee hockey team
The Dundee Stars team made a loss in the Elite League on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning a retaliatory match on Saturday in Dundee with a score of 5:3.
The Giants team won an early two-point lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowie, the locals settled, but then Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard won the Dundee team, but then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who turned the score and defeated the Dundee 2:1 team in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season between the rivals when the Giants team won in the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 for Kendal McFaull's assistance, and four minutes later David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier when he doubled the lead.
During the busy opening part, Sullivan returned home to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured Cowie’s settlement at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants team took the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
Homers regrouped and Bouchard once again leveled with a goal during the game without a goalkeeper at 27:37.
Cowie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen for the first time in the match to secure the Dundee team’s leadership in the second part and he took care of the win in the middle of the last part.
The Giants team, which has now lost four of their last five matches, plays at home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic operator dies to ensure flight leaks with hundreds of passengers before earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic operator is celebrated as a hero after he died when he secured a safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a major earthquake that hit Sulawesi on Friday and launched the tsunami.
Strong shocks continue to trouble the area, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonias Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the wildly moving tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He stayed in place to make sure that Flight 6321 Batik Air, which was at the time on the track, would safely take off.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
A spokesman for air navigation in Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision was able to save hundreds of lives, ABC News said.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantana, to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning while the helicopter arrived at Pala.
“We were very sad when we found out,” he added.
Meanwhile, experts are concerned that the number of victims could reach thousands. The disaster mitigation agency in the country says there is limited access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutique cities.
“The number is likely to continue to grow because many bodies were still under the ruins and we couldn’t reach many people,” Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugro said in a statement.
The waves, which reached up to six meters, destroyed Pala, where a mass funeral takes place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are everywhere -
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the rest, but we don’t know what to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Pala on Sunday and said to the army in the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
“You’re ready,” said CNN.
The earthquakes hit Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, one man is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
An airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says there's a missing man after she said they safely evacuated all 47 passengers and a crew from a diver's plane.
Air Niugini said on Saturday that one man was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the crash and what was the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the start of the landing.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had passed the course.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“That was a great deal of luck,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pierce deep water into the emergency exit on a sinking plane.
He said the stewardess was panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working close to improving the pier helped save by means of an inflatable boat that brought people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data suggests that 111 people have died in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any accident.
Analysts determine the time axis of the night during which a woman was burned alive
The charge ended on Saturday in a reopened lawsuit against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cell phone records to link 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at night when she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers' evening when she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, said The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, Chambers, the police talked to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was \"damaged because my car was in Nashville.\"
Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they only met for one week.
Rowlett said that sometimes after the death of Jessica Chambers Tellis deleted her messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He deleted it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense plans to present the final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the court to go before the jury that day.

Another black girl?
New York nurse sus couple for denunciation after \"racist-text message\"
New York’s nurse sued a couple for discriminating the job after receiving an incorrect text message from a mother complaining that she was “another black woman”
The couple denies that they are racists, the lawsuit compares to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her apprehension when she found out that the new caregiver of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
“NIEEEEEE, another black woman,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after being “hammed”, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman realized that she had thrown out Mrs. Maurice, and said that their outgoing caregiver, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been expecting the Philippines instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent to Uber's home.
Mrs Maurice is now suing a couple for being fired from work and demanding a compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months, for working with an employer they originally hired for, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that such things are not done,” she said on Friday for the Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
A few argue that they are racists, defends and advocates that the termination of Mrs Maurice’s job was a reasonable thing because they feared that they could no longer trust her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racist,” said Joel Plasco’s husband for the Post.
“But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
His newborn child?
But go -
Comparing the lawsuit to “distortion,” Plasco said his wife had only two months of child and was in a “very difficult situation”
“Would you go after someone like that?”
That’s not a very nice thing,” added the investment banker.
While the lawsuit still takes place, the public quickly condemned the couple on social media, encountering their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared readers wouldn’t have a relationship with the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of this letter: “It is difficult to find yourself in the skin of someone who read it for the first time before the release.
It’s very fun to know what we now know about Paddington’s huge success.
She said her father was optimistic about refusing his job. Before he got an idea and wrote a child's book about a small bear, she worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was \"hot-sweet - for his death last year.
She added that on Paddington’s possible success, which she describes as “a very important member of our family,” her father was quietly proud.
“He was quite a calm man and was not a praiser,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your job.
I think that's how Paddington's success was felt.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing with her daughter, they hurried to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“At a regular rate, he called me to tell me that it’s really bad that she’s not expected to be able to do it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and told me that he would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you very much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to maintain the functioning of her heart slowly rejuvenate and leave her system.
She died shortly before, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t even cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stick -
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now saddening her daughter's loss, entered the plane next to the other passengers, regardless of the suffering she's been through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
“I’ve had my head tilted and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nad.
I understood that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women's saddening messages prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have come for suicide about their loved ones are trying to prevent others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have links to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational news and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room.
But he gave up his work before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I am constantly worried that this will have a chain effect.”
Mrs. Davis made links to “to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Do not sit in silence - you must say -
A longtime friend of Mrs. Daisy, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, a partner with whom she was 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or depressed, or something else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his mood change.
On Christmas Eve, he was on a complete day, when the children opened their gifts, neither looked at them nor looked at anything else.
She said his death is a huge trauma for them, but they must get through it: “It will create a hole across the family.
It's tearing us.
But we all have to continue and fight -

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh is not sure because the FBI will begin an investigation
“I thought if we could really achieve what he was asking for, a time or a scale-limited investigation, we could agree on something,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Commission would “break down” in the middle of an obstacle.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is caused by timing.
Elections in the middle of the term of office are only five weeks away, on November 6, if, as expected, Republicans will not succeed, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they have chosen to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbyed to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to change the indecisive outcome and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserters \"falls - under Kim's rule\"
North Korean deserters have been falling since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1 127 deserters last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by the converters.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the north will eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them violently.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, representatives of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on suspended denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work on a peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yongho said Saturday that insufficient progress was due to US sanctions.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we would first unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brittany Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The head of the Senate minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the nominee of the Supreme Court of Brittany Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and said that his temperament was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke in a Saturday interview during the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think if a woman did, they would say she was ‘hysterical,’ Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate’s court committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating when discussing his family and high school period.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations a \"grotesque and coordinated type of assassination - organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Mrs Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony would prove that she could not serve in the Supreme Court because she would turn out to be interested in Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualified by these statements and the way he’s persecuted the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi said she would try to blame Kavanaugh if his nomination is confirmed and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I'll say one thing - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not only appropriate to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court he's in right now,\" Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal in D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because she was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Isn’t it time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Well, isn’t that wonderful?’,” Pelosi said.
Women must control it.
It's a legitimate attack, months and years of rage that can't be held in sight, and she can't talk about it without crying.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, though.
She continued: “A woman who was a leading worker was very helpful to me, and she said she was also crying when she got angry, but she started using the procedure that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I was sad because I am crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she just continued.
I think it's great -
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of anger because they are extremely incomprehensible.
One of my brightest memories of my early employment in a mostly male office where I once cried out of indescribable rage is when an older woman, a cool manager, I was always a little afraid of, caught my back and pulled me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they got under your skin.
Patricia Schroeder, a later-democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his fight for a presidential chair.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a ship called Monkey Business and ended the candidacy, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply frustrated that there was no single reason why she should not deal with the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”
Since the campaign has long been launched, it was behind the scenes of raising funds, so it promised not to enter the game if it didn’t get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
“They think I’m left-handed, she was surprised.
During her speech about not starting an official campaign, she was overestimated by so much emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that caused it to be so hard to get money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger on sexism - that she was intimidating.
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said in a statement.
“You might have thought that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I was going to write on my gravestone.
“The One Who Cryed”
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The beginnings of the trade war between the US and China were deafening and while the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can be a long-term benefit for Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion ($150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has paid off every time in the same way, in recent years, tariffs of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to deal with American tactics, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to go away.
Achieving Washington’s concessions would be a challenge, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, the U.S. public compliment would be even more embarrassing.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the US trade war could in the long run positively support China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will trigger economic confusion in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than we’ve seen before,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia’s think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation here is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal state.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
Since the beginning of the war, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in rebuilding the ravaged country.
However, he stressed that he did not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe confirms victory in the Ryder Cup tournament in Paris
In 2018, the European team won the Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National golf course near Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and since 1993 it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe once again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points they needed to overcome the United States of America.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who failed in most tournaments, fired his first shot in the water on the 16th hole with par 3 and gave up his match for Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds and became one of four players who played 5-0-0 since the beginning of the tournament in 1979.
Jordan Spieth is the lowest-ranking player in the European Thorbjorn Olesen team in Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, died 2 and 1 Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played at his last Ryder Cup tournament.
The Veteran of the eight Ryder Cup tournaments, Spain’s Sergio Garcia, has become a record European tournament winner with a number of points in the 25.5 career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm very happy that the glass is coming back.
It’s about the team, I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said under the influence of emotions after the European victory.
He handed over the stadium to his compatriot John Ram, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods with two holes at the remaining hole in the game of individuals on Sunday.
“In the defeat of Tiger Woods, I feel incredible pride, I grew up watching this guy,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup record.
A special statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought all weekend to find the right way, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk performed after an unsatisfied performance in front of his team, “I’m proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning it was time for Europe to get sick of the situation.
We fought.
Hat down in front of Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will re-create the group, cooperate with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I like these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be a captain.
Hat down.
You have defeated us -
Current state of the red sludge: The concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasote
The latest report by the Florida Committee on the Protection of Fish and Wildlife shows a general decline in red sludge concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, several conditions are reported in relation to the coating, suggesting decreasing concentrations.
The red sludge is about 130 miles off the coast from the northern Pinellas to the southern districts of Lee.
Spots can be found about 10 miles from the Hillsborough Coast, but in a smaller number of cities compared to last week.
They also saw red sludge in the Pasco area.
Medium coastal or off-shore concentrations in Pinellas have been reported last week, low to high sea concentrations in Hillsborough, high concentrations in Manatee, high coastal or off-shore concentrations in Sarasota, central concentrations in Charlotte, high coastal or off-shore concentrations in Lee and low concentrations in Collier.
The respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
The respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwestern Florida in the last week.
