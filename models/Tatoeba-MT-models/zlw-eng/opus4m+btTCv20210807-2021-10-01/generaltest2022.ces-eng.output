The great return of the Czech evil man is coming.
Pavel France was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel France, who has been going through a tough period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-year-old Pilsen native will be on the alternator, and he could soon get into the goal.
Former goalkeeper Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
In the middle of the game with Vegas, he has not yet introduced himself to the NHL.
The incident occurred when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to the other.
“Pavel France will be outside about three to four weeks with injuries at the bottom of the body,” the whole of Denver said in a statement.
His return to the NHL goal was extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time was called from a farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, 94.5% of the procedures were attributed.
The hockey player wants to finally win and confirm that he belongs to the world’s best league.
In the last year, he had problems with his hips, and in the shortened pandemic year he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL, \"France - caught 36 matches, its success rate is 92.3%.
On Christmas wish, Charles puts on a Camille mask, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate, as this year’s Christmas wish, chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also published his wish, which used a photo in which his Choti Camille helps to put on the clothes.
The BBC reported this on its website.
The wishes are sent to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they work.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte also has her dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same clothes as Princes George and Louis shorts and a T-shirt with a collar.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not mention, it is not clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, a royal family for photography designed as a Christmas wish laid on a bundle of straw in front of a pile of wood in its rural seat in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein was captured in June at Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on her head and on her face, helps Camille put on her suit colored with bright dresses.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbra a million for the title, the Hardwire denied it.
Prague - Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had a promise from Prague Slavia a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server about it, saying he got to some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club Jaroslav Tvrík said that they did not commit any corruption negotiations.
The server published a transcript of police interceptions, in which Slavia is mainly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended last summer at the master club.
A former influential red-and-white official, according to the file, was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the then secondary-legal Visegrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in a case among the accused.
Criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro had promised financial rewards when he won the title.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Praha title in the first league.
The police body had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should have a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Praha, citing a server from the file for winning the league.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the Board of Directors Slavie Hardik.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The claimant refused any corruption proceedings.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, tried not to influence the referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial performance in this context to anyone,” the statement said.
In listening, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former players Slavia dark skin and also apologizes to his former head of the Hardcore.
In mid-October, the case of alleged influence of matches through the referee launched a police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The highest in the world is Berbr, which no longer features any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the Cold War.
The works will be new, but basically of a worse type (the artillery must be from the armored cabin and carry the bullets manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have any (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium-cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such stories.
I've got a chase right next to the city.
From the river there was a nutritiousness and they were doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the river.
I didn't want to fuck up, so I sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something came out, but, of course, there was a fox in a while.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked himself, waved his forehead on all sides, so I called him that it was a fox.
Before I got out of the seat, he was gone.
I mean, the meadow of a man is a Prussiar.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of a lot of coincidence to happen, you'd probably see in the thermovision that almost everyone today.
So, in a noticeable place, dear things, put your feet in a sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Homelands get respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for buying and distributing clothing, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRoz Radio server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for the respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy grooves?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with the editor of the iReview server Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (I may not be affected by the memories of Czechoslovakia, which have been lost by the older generations), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from the compulsory war.
We don’t even have large warehouses of techniques that can take hold of exercise, we don’t actually have a modern technique even for existing professionals, in addition, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so bookmarking skills will quickly lose in time.
To do this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, will not be the time to practice someone again.
Finally, taboos/territory defenses are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it goes to lead a mass gerile and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic there will only be a conflict of such a scale and intensity, where gerila will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
We don’t have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
This happens when you look like a guy who didn’t hit an empty gate for two minutes, gets into attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss, and you say, ‘twil and what you think is going to happen now.’
But of course, he is taken as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill is so terrible that I am truly surprised to see that our attacker was able to play a single player.
The First Flags
The Covid pandemic slows down, but experts do not expect any major twists for the coming weeks.
Tension in hospitals according to statistical models still lasts for some time, and the new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the variant of omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of action, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity can help against it obtained by previous disease.
This week, however, there was also an unexpected plus-side phenomenon: treatment.
A new drug, the antivirus molinupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the paxlovid drug from Pfizer, which reports the success rate of even 85 percent of the results so far.
However, in addition to the hope of extending the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavir pandemic, the first deliveries of molnupiravire to the Czech Republic have also highlighted the question of how the administration is ready for incoming medicines.
As it was said, the first to get to the domestic patients of Molnupiravir by Merck.
The company ended on tape first and also because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
This research often forgets that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not share their views openly.
For Eastern Europeans, especially Czechs, we are used to talking - how our beak has grown -
See where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people say they don’t.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist cows.
And then they go and choose parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing work and media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, West Good, East Bad.
But he'll really find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have a survey of more than 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
The same is true of unit spins so that soldiers don’t have to re-learn where they are, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of Brda, and the other two are abandoned.
The joke is that the SSSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either because of the safety or speed of deployment of warheads due to the western position.
In these underground covers (there are two in each maple) only the warheads, not the entire rocket, are stored.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this head and mounted on some supporting device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolating state.
At the second grade of primary school, we had a classmate, Gypsy, and we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he was doing good jokes, he often showed up too much, but it was our masquerade.
Everyone was having fun with him, he often walked and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he walked regularly, he did sports with us, he did not steal snacks, or telephones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he was doing various monkey shops, but he was fine, maybe never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same year, other classes.
Shortly after that, they beat a teacher, she often solved something there police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I’ve sold to the Gypsies often, they’ve always had money, they haven’t tried to pull me on the price, the communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called in a month that he had already overwritten it.
I'm saying, I'm not racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, until they behave as they belong to a decent society (work, works, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he stretches his hand, he dries out apartments and houses, he's just a mess around him, he's making problems... so no matter what color he's got, but he's gonna bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they engage with us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care if they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
Young woman died in car crash in Prachatick
“The young woman suffered a severe multiple injury and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she fell victim to the site,” said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemia’s health care professionals.
The accident was likely caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and from the undetected causes he left in turn.
After the collision with Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot on the roof outside the road, described the accident of a spokesperson for the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a multiple injury and remained in the car spelled out.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care, and in stable condition he was aired to the hospital of the Czech Republic, said rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that a man from the second car suffered a lighter chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU packages, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly takes collectible cards.
“It can usually be tens of dollars, let’s say from tens of dollars, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free,” the collector said.
Since October, the order for small shipments has been slightly expensive, new VAT has to be added and the post office has to pass the data for customs proceedings.
He will receive an e-mail saying that the customs officers are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT did not include the trader already on sale, it will be measured by the customs office from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not secure the customs procedure itself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two drop-down boxes, I insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments from abroad fell from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the challenges to provide the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 international shipments to be processed.
If people fill in all the data they need and fill them in on time, we would be here about half, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
The solution to inflation
See the headlines, how would you suggest a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to increase further.
What do you think should cost to slow down or compensate for this growth?
Do we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, for example, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it goes?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is an employee)?
I was added 2% this year in gross, which is a laugh, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted violents are sent behind bars for maybe only 6 months?
This head just doesn't take away from me how a court can only send such an animal behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to his/her victim having trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And not to mention that the victim of the rape must never recover from it again.
Does this even discourage the potential future reporting of the rape of victims?
The Man of the Tomb \"burned his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Tomb reluctantly helped the guards secure his nationwide sought-after girlfriend from Kostomlat, on whom the arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to her.
He went to it with a occlusion.
He first approached the passerby and invented a story that he had been stolen.
The guards arrived on the emergency line after the call and were not surprised when the alleged \"stealed\" told them that he had invented everything so that the guards would come to their place.
In fact, he wanted only to advise the officers on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
In checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and she was ordered to be arrested.
The case is addressed by the Czech Republic.
A sincere question for the people here, do you think our country is Slavic?
I personally believe that we are not ethnically or culturally long ago, but I would be interested in your opinion.
I agree, of course, with me, that Churchill was not able to secure the liberation of Prague by the United States.
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case to be a true faith.
Here I cannot agree with Pascal, in the world there is an estimate, if I am not mistaken, of about ten thousand different religions.
Which Gods or Gods will you choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you unscrupulously if you believe in another god.
But even in the tenth it is worth noting that there is no god other than the LORD.
Would it not, then, be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing wrong from those thousands of gods, and the one real god I just didn’t hit will send me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the parts of the Czech Republic would be useful.
This could be done in collaboration with the University of Defense.
We can speak this way: the cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly happening, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intertwining process where the labour force migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
Similar intertwining should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany or, for example, the Mongol invader will never come here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved into the stone, we have allies, and they will defend us if there is a mess.
Come on, please, man.
There is only one election in the U.S. that will round their budget and the entire NATO goes to hell.
The Anglicans exchange us for Russian money, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown themselves once that it is enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works for the long term as a guarantee of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military technique of their time.
And today he can pilot the remote-controlled means of every teenager, so what can't.
We don't need border fortifications, that's to the fart today, but the shrewd teenager behind the handle of the remote controlled device will be able to handle it.
How to Donate in a Boxed Tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under a Christmas tree and suddenly you are stuck in boxes and fillings at home?
This \"waste - re-use the e-shops that the packaging materials lack.
Therefore, a map of shops has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
Not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring a cardboard box, plastic or paper fillings into the engaged shop (a map of the project KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150) of them.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
Stores themselves welcome packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of eco-thinking customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such store is also TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and filler material for us in Popůvek u Brna is carried by the individuals to whom they accumulate at home, but we are also told by companies with whom we have agreed regular downloads of delayed cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together form a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to the next generations, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only collection sites for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take the sorted waste from the household, where to hand over passed medicines, tires, earned electrical, batteries, light sources, bulk waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, and in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
The overall map of the project already contains more than 100,000 such places.
Gradually there are collection courts, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places to help find use for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from Uklďďm Czech Republic.
It seems to me wrong that today the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they will not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (especially in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide that underlying file system with folders and all fit into one screen in the app.
Let them use technique from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewritten history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency last weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the Presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they could not take place in six months.
French politicians like it, and voters like it.
Macron’s supporter of the right-wing and left-wing strides agree on little but on Europe.
And in France, there will be a new election for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write \"one history of Europe - and France is ready for such a work of historians to create conditions.
A number of commentators immediately contributed with criticism that Macron was a pro-European propaganda and rewritten history.
In fact, it’s trying to prevent history from overwriting.
The far-right candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now circling France with the theory that the Vichy regime, which cooperated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea for one textbook of history seriously and let’s not look at the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story we versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs will find out who defeated who in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech - Mouse - did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won the award for the director and for the best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary Festival, he was on the first page of the viewer’s ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having a flu/to be infested - I had diarrhea for a few days and I didn't want to smoke very much.
Compared to the flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea in the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

In his last novel, the author tells a much less emotional story about the return from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who have remained and those who have left know too little about themselves to put it into life together.
Trains begin to travel according to the new timetable, where carriers change somewhere
From Sunday, trains begin to ride on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some tracks, for example between Usti nad Labem and Kolín, where the Czech Railways are starting to ride RegioJet.
Most lines only adjust the time of departure, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
The Czech Railways plan to travel on average 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which the average of 478 long-distance trains will be daily.
Trains run around 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
Railways next to national routes within the new timetable will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will run from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be carried out by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices by an average of 3.2% from next year.
Roads take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entry to line R23 Ústi nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
After success in the Ministry of Transport competition, the carrier will replace the Czech Railways.
On a daily basis, RegioJet will host a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes are related to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain as much as possible the driving times of his long-distance trains despite the planned outage work.
Without major changes, the operation of the Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also change in some regional routes.
The changes await passengers, for example, in the Czech Republic, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lipa to Rumburk will be driven by Die Länderbahn German company instead of the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflation rate of 3.2%.
I have to disagree.
Do we not learn to look at the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to labor, they died.
In my life, I have not heard the teaching from the perspective of a slave party or from that point on, no one defends it, only condemns it.
No one will tell you in schools that blacks often sold their own slaves into slavery, and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers have often bought land from Indians, they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans have murdered them, while murdering each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, right in schools, both in northern schools and southern schools.
I haven’t met with the fact that someone would deliberately silence the facts, but I’ve heard before that this is happening, and I think it’s a problem, I don’t deny it (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s perspective, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about someone’s feelings, it’s just what it is, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it again.
By the way, when we are in those southern states, yes, the Confederate Flag and famous slaves are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it came to me absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North wasn’t much better than enough people are idealizing it today.
And a lot of people forget that not all of them were slaves in the South, and enough things happened to them too.
I wouldn’t compare this with the Russians, they deliberately miss some facts, they lie and manipulate, even if our view doesn’t exist with them (there was also a video on YT from TV, where they left someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What came to me at U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never experienced their land.
Overall, I found it terrible at some universities, these students were radicalized enough, and the schools supported them how many times.
And if I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I'm a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long reached what it had, and it is no longer the same, radicalized itself.
At present, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as do other groups such as LGBT and lead to radicalization on the other hand, where this often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more they hear.
At the end of the day, I didn’t see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I’d rather have met a bad geography, but that was two-way :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely unconditional.
Do I have to be proud of something I couldn’t do alone?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality to be useless in terms of personal identity.
If I have such interests with people, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very good guy, he has a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks some cocaine about coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church is here.
Officially, they are Protestants, but they were actually born of Catholic modernity and are actually Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to worship for Hussite because it is theologically very similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on the street Botanická.

The Flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame inflamed in Bethlehem, where according to the Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavir pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Breclav border crossing.
It was also taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, said Scout Amalia Budíková to the current journalists.
While last year the transfer took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, right on the border bridge, now at the crossing of Reintal-Břeclav in the parking lot.
Usually, however, a Scout rides a train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes about the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem’s light, the Scouts traditionally set off on a train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, 18 December, Scouts will take care of the subsequent delivery of light, travelling with select speeds and passenger trains.
From them, local Scouts or volunteers will take the light from the stations, who will then continue to spread flames in the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, the Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavir.
It's going like last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, of course, to wear the clothes, to try to observe the stretches, were as few as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave so that it was as safe as possible, the spokesperson for the action of the Bethlehem light Zuzana Hrbková described.
The tradition of Bethlehem's light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time.
The light of Bethlehem is for the faithful a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
Scouts and Scouts have been involved in its spread in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event stands on hundreds of volunteers, and flames are also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don’t have economic education, so I don’t know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are cancer of the economy, but I don’t think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education is making good use of the money, I don’t understand why the money is put in agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned above, an unnecessary product is produced and it invades the free market and the 'natural life of the company'.
I work in the factory myself, where there are millions of messages in the corridors, funded/co-financed by the xy project, and such a company is just artificially held alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is a slowdown of development when this company holds on to and takes out contracts/employees to companies that could grow and become more productive after its end.
Total consent, it's terrible.
Sometimes even the person who was born in the internet time also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don’t think internet ads will move with me, but then I’m going to catch myself that they’ve influenced me, too, and it’s just so bad that a person doesn’t always get away with it.
For this reason, I also support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all shit, it's classics - I'd ban the internet.
I feel like this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
I will not believe something that most believe and makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will claim to be a critical thought.
I will not believe everything the media say.
I don’t believe the politicians.
TV has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles - Cinema, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present a record more than two hundred to their audiences at the premiere.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience, which is why these images are becoming more and more.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only the images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its title, so there will actually be much more Christmas movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mainly fairy tales associated with this period, worldwide there are also popular pictures of themselves at home, Love heavenly or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
However, the real boom of Christmas pictures only started in 2009, when the special film series came to the American cable television station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began to tune its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime has 35 new Christmas films this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
“In this magical period of the story, it doesn’t matter so much, it’s important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” said Brandon Gray, author of the Christmas film I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
“To the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years,” Gray added.
For example, Hallmark still uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then it will arise about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will seem to solve, and the two will like.
This is how it is all the time, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, they watch people one by one, complements Gray.

The Haas station sends only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th place, which he went out in qualifying.
However, the Russians, Nikki Mazepin, from Haas, will not hit the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positively for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, and the last line will be on the track of Mazepin’s teammate, Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will fight for the title with Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle.
Mazepine is relatively okay and has no symptoms.
Nikki was physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all stakeholders,” said its representatives for formula1.com.
He can't even send a replacement rider to the Haas race.
A potential replacement would have to complete a qualification or a ride on another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not faced with Covid-19.
At the start of the upcoming season, covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen had, last year they were positively tested by Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, Silver and 150 Diamonds: The price list of the most expensive sweater will surprise you!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry and the creator put in it half a year of work and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our homes, the sweaters were never very much worn,” says Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours in a half year.
Silk bought in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals were delivered by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater softness,” the creator praises his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's another hook.
“I’m totally out of nowhere, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he will make a world record.
To date, the most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost “only 720 000 crowns.

The government approved the sending of up to 150 troops to help Poland.

They are supposed to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build a planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries, in connection with several months of ongoing actions by the Belarusian regime, which in its territory invites citizens of the Middle East countries with a false promise to easily cross the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating in the Polish territory.

Another case of a child from Adam is being examined by hygiene.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this variant in another child from Adam’s preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University is not proven,” said Ciupek.
Six cases occurred in the region during the week.
\"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,\" she said.
She added that these are two nurses from one of Brno University Hospital and two children from one of them, and two 11-year-old students from Adamov University.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adam.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four symptom-free course.
No one suspected of Omikron traveling abroad
None of them traveled abroad, nor any of their families, nor did any contact with anyone who would stay abroad.
There is no connection with the water pole championship, said Ciupek.

California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Calvin News announced on Saturday that he had announced a plan to ban the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state with the help of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law following the detection of the heart rate of the embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and hand-made firearms in California.
Newsoma’s announcement responded to a statement by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday that the Texas abortion ban has been in force, even though it is against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion on the ground throughout the U.S. until around 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has now not decided on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue that arises from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack it by the usual judicial means.
“I am outraged by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court last Friday that allowed the Texas ban to be maintained by most abortion services and to a large extent supported Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” the governor said in a statement.
“If states can now block a review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” he said.
In cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, he said he would work on measures that would entitle the public representative to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how they are referred to as sub-home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulation.
Newsmen want “private citizens” to have the right to demand compensation of at least US$10,000 (over CZK 220 000) and court expenses from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, components in “gathering spirits” or sets for their production in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, create a threat to private lawsuits, then we should do exactly that,” he said.
For decades, California banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June, the federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state actually renews the ban with the use of the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in an unconsented opinion on Friday’s majority verdict, warned of the extension of the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity to abortion and allowed abortion clinics to proceed with actions against selected officials of the southern state of the United States.
Every emergency vaccination has its own public test phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
Perhaps from Israel, a large study of the effects of 4 doses has already been conducted.
And according to these studies, most patients experience a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will have its own vaccination scheme after a while, just too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should come into the market shortly, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, promises up to 10 times more efficiency.

Poland threatens to stop payments in the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it used new powers and, due to a dispute over the rule of law, stopped the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan on the withdrawal of €36 billion from the EU Fund for the recovery of the affected economies of the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this extortion by the EU by veto on all matters that require unanimity,” Ziobro, head of the small party, Solidarity Poland, said, without its votes, the current government would lose a close majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy leading to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro said.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is illegally denying us the resources from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish Minister added.
In its approach to the EU, its party takes more radical positions than the ruling party Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Polish justice has undergone for Ziobrov threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, builds \"unfortunate conditions, because its aim is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland.\"
Warsaw is facing “a political dictatorship carried out by blackmailing and trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make such concessions to Brussels, which would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
“We will never agree that Poland will have a colony status,” he said.
But to be sure, in Lidl, there's one kind of cheese in four different places.

I was punished with a cook in my childhood.
It was never because of the signs, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (she read instead of going to bed, fighting with her brother, etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a wound (sometimes even after the next \"caught\" the cook just brought and laid down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my butt (via clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial, because the child responds much more to them than to words.
I think the part with warning is important because it gives the child in a way to choose whether to listen and get or improve and the punishment will not be.
At the end of the day, it was only enough for me to listen.
System Defense
When an important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalistic question about what the Czech constitution means for him - whether the sacred document he swears to and learns from school or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely adhered to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with the changes they are better saved.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl voted in that time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasingly growing view among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs change.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
He was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference with their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, but only then can it be the key to mastering most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of order of rule consisting of individual rules, which lay down the rules for the politicians of the mantinels of the game.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that coronavirus is milder for children, there are also difficult cases that hospitals have been facing recently.
“We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, a primary physician at the Department of Child Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at Brno University and Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in recent periods,” said Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place in a clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavir are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the department according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, pneumonia, which requires a stay on the resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease interferes alongside adults, both adolescents and a few months old baby.
In hospitals there are also children in severe condition due to coronavir.
“We currently have a child of several months of age and adolescents,” the prime minister said.
However, he is pleased that in the children's hospital of FN Brno, he has not yet experienced any childhood deaths on the coronavirus.
According to the available data, the death of six children aged 0 to 14 years occurred in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominika, there is an integral part of the collaboration of a psychologist in a children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it also points out that, as in adults and children, vaccinations reduce the course of the disease and at the same time reduce the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
“We therefore recommend the use of the vaccine dose in children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone you can walk only on marked roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They are visible on the tourist map on map.
In general, in national parks outside the peace zone you can walk anywhere (but do not cross the fence into the field).
Skiing / cycling in the forest outside the marked road must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it does not look so much outside the national parks).
How does the conductor exercise?

He cooperates with the castle Philharmonic, with the film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonoš symphony orchestra.
China builds an impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirous: China builds an impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China has gone into both medical and political offensives.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop the infection that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in infected people.
States including the Czech Republic compete for Chinese protective devices and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing’s willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend and says to him, \"Hey, don't you want an elephant?\"
I got it and it's great.
Wife likes it because she saves the grass, she washes the car with a Chobot, the children play with it.
Well, it's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
My friend: I'm paying for it, it's gonna be great.
After some time they will meet and the one who bought the complaint: the man who sold it as an elephant????
The lawn of the spoiled, giant shit everywhere, the car sat down, the children were afraid of him, and the wife wanted to get divorced.
He who sells says, \"You're not really talking about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that.\"
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is true, they are the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only become such a power if it works towards its integration.
It is still functioning at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will be done.
I thought about it, too, and it's possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might say.
I'm just saying that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary - Spanish oranges and mandarins - when it is clear that these are both from Spain, while with - Spanish fruits and mandarins - it is no longer clear from the mandarins that they are from Spain.
In addition, I assume that the phrase is “all American forces”, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and it is not necessary to further specify it in the US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying :D
Either way, it's an absurd requirement.

Vicki Holland Tolerance of Assemblies by Milly
Scary shots show the moment when the scared monkey screamed in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner rinsed her and laughed at her.
Holland's monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrate Court has now banned her from breeding animals for a lifetime, according to The Sun.
Ape rehabilitation experts who care about Milly after her abuse said they’ve never seen such a scared cosman before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she is playing with another saved monkey named Moon.
A four-time mother has admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to a 12-week sentence of imprisonment with a conditional delay of one year at the GWENT MA's court.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on animal husbandry and had to pay in the conversion of 12,000 crowns of court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the tortured animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue,” she said.
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She screamed and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, she can still panic over new people.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, says Sawyer.
Milly's bullying came out after the Gwent police discovered horrific shots in a woman's phone after she was beaten in her apartment because of drug charges.
On the footage you can hear how Milly's vulgar.
The next video shows how Holland's monkey offers cocaine and says, \"You want cocaine.\"
So kiss my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found for £1600 (in the reading of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was arrested for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this prehistoric three times in a row when you boldly skip the whole 20th century?
Like you're taking the same things in the first class as in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifling, when no one, the honor of exceptions, doesn't matter if you know it or understand it.
Write a test for one, and then no one cares.
Go and on the street randomly ask people whether to manage the character of the roots of the quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even cut and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don't want and don't have a need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learned for the many people who will need the thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all of this to stand at the machine, I was serious... 'cause you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing them is a sign of punk.
(This is probably what our communist past is involved in and angry with education and elites) But the price of barbarics standing with these machines is just high.
If the journalists could count, the covid probably never reached these dimensions.

Between Kadrim and Andrea, this has been the case since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she strongly rejected it.
And as they are seen, their relationship not only ended with love, but rather has grown into mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was angry with Kadri's turn in response to Andre's allegations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri’s alleged sincerity was no longer liked by his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stand up to her brother publicly.
Normally, I don’t talk about these things at all, and we’ve never really thought about these things in our family.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to hurt the public and spy on the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give me that!
I am sorry to have to do this this this way, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri publicly for making him a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I am more sorry if I have to read such false information, which is probably quite torn out of context.
I would very much like to know Kadri as I, our loved one and family, stand in a confession in response to the words of Andrey.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality, and we know how it really was, have added indeterminately.
A drunk thief climbs the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao started his robbery in a parking lot in a residential district, where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually alienated from one vehicle in a calculation of less than 330 crowns.
After that, he did not think of anything better than climbing to the 5th floor and entering the apartment with an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
On a shot from one security camera, it is then captured as he leaves the street away from the crime scene and eats a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She was then arrested by Cchaa.
The man admitted that he drank alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to be drunk.
The whole thing is under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Law is a time-limited and effectiveness bound to pandemic emergency.
When it is abolished, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right to collect will be limited, but not revoked.
More than 60 percent of voters came to the election on Saturday.
On Saturday, people voted in the village of Komňa in Uherskohradisk, Lužice on Mosteck, Nová Ves in Libereck and in Rovná on Pelhřimovsk.

On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the National Electoral Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead Civilian or Foreign Policy?
I think that's all you know about people here.
You're just playing a fool so you can have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerators or anything like that.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was a goal to look good).
I don’t care who believes in what they believe.
On the other hand, I don’t care how much the Church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money she had spent, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaget monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man dropped his head down from 12 meters.
The impact on concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night, a man in Ostrava who was hit by rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
The staff of the regional operating center took an hour after Saturday midnight emergency calls with initial information about the fall of a man from the height.
Two medical and medical crews immediately left the site.
After arriving at the hospital site, they found that a twenty-seven-year-old man was supposed to fall off the window from a height of about twelve meters and fall head to concrete!
Coal caught in Vitkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to life.
The intervening doctor instigated his respiratory tract, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures under pre-hospital emergency care, the sanitary vehicle transported him to the additional care of the Ostrava traumatic center, the spokesperson of the ZZS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have more concern about coronavir than I have from inadequate public and public responses.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the disease there are mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking the military doctor David Rezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Olivera defended the belt
The MMA experienced a wonderful gala evening full of interesting results.
There were things going on at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary struggler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years has not found the overcomer.
Charles Oliver did not hesitate in light weight, demonstrated a great scurvy against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly misplaced Candy Garbrandt’s technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought a women's match of bantam scales between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňová.
The American woman entered the battle as a conceivable “dwarves,” for seven years Nunes has not lost her teeth and had another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to win a lot of activity, and the rival even gave her the push kick she sent her to the ground.
However, the money was not forced to make any other mistake, and she tried to attack herself unsuccessfully with the help of a lever on her hand.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for fans of MMA.
Both rivals took part in a lot of excellent hits and hard hooks.
In addition, Nunes got to the ground where she began to cut it.
She had to give up the attack and lay off the attack.
The American woman prepared a great shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Olive and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was better off, but the card began to turn.
In the latter he tried to be more active Oliver, who tried to hit the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He failed too much, but then he put a lot of pressure on his back, got his opponents on his back, and filled him with many wounds.
Thanks to that, the second round won.
In the third round, Olivera showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier had resisted for a while, but then he had to knock off the scurvy.
The Brazilians defended the title, while Poirier lost two years later.
In the next match, he credited the sovereign triumph of Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then beat it with a number of exact strokes and recorded the 15th triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes was celebrating another triumph with her little daughter, and now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, nothing is complicated.
Most notable names in Czech only express one grammatical gender, and therefore there is no problem in them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle gender.
But then there is also a fairly numerous group of nouns in which the genera is not stable.
Such essential names fluctuate between two families.
In the case of inclination, they acquire two ends, and in some cases they remain indecent.
For example, the words \"snailed - or \"snail - are male and female, in the first they bow down according to the pattern \"machine - in the second according to the pattern \"snail -\"
For other groups of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of a single number, such as: \"Line/line - \"Kedlubna\" or \"bambora/bambora\" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may vary regionally, for example, \"curds - in Bohemia and \"curds - in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is indescribable, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: \"Příkop\" and \"Příkop - \"kobliha\" and \"koblih\" etc.
Some of the words that came into the Czech language were originally inconvenient, but they gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression \"image - which is male and female, or the word \"buffet - which has remained in the middle family inconvenient, but in the male, it has an ending according to the pattern \"the castles\"
Turkey has paved its way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like at the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara ceased to defend them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What motivates refugees on an uncertain path?
What does the situation look like right on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we've been suffocating, a journalist from Sydney says.
The devastating fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves cope with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent drastic impacts, according to critics?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False charges have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why everyone is always written everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to order it.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how they often treat the people around them or the police.
Victims should always believe.
The trend was that the victims finally opened up about their traumas.
But he still keeps too many people to himself.
There are also those who falsely blame someone.
It’s terrible and flowing into the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “a large part of the accusation is fabricated” and that it’s a “trend” you only help sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods built houses, families do not have money to complete
Building material prices have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of this.
It does not have the means to complete built-up family houses, and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already built family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to disassembled and uncollected houses.
In a worse case, uninhabitable houses are built and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to repay mortgages and pay rents,” says the economist BHS Štěpán Řeček.
We will build two to three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of them have happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to keep some things contractual, even though the material has been expensive.
So we do without profit,” said the owner of the construction company Zdenek Slovoň.
A lot of people will have financial problems.
If they were counting on building a house to be five million, then it's going to cost seven.
“I think some will wait,” added the elephant.
Of the material, copper, iron and also plumbing equipment were the most depleted.
Construction companies are also struggling with a lack of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of the construction industry and the influx of foreign workers are hindered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of building permits is more favourable.
“The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” said Křeček.
We're fine, and we'll be even better.
The real vision is missing, says ČRO commentator - mujRad
In addition to classical celebrations, the entry to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by the manifestations of politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and President of ANO, Andrei Babiš and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman and the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As I find my diploma super, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The statesmen are completely at peace with us, if a man is not a complete macaque and there is something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him to the theory.
For example, I was learning from the state for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission was always trying to guide me to some logical extradition, which I immediately had, and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project to them (we did it many times, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then just learn the project and have it aged.
I think it's great when at the end of the subject there's a test to which the knowledge gained within the project is reflected, not just defense.
But don’t block emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as them.
Those people in the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so they might have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the Pooh Bear.
You might have given it to Xi Jinping in the ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists at their feet.
As soon as you don’t give stories every day, and at least every other day a new picture, the impact will be reduced to a complete minimum.
In addition, it changes what function is more important if you want a toolbar, comment, or save.
I've been scared of it lately, so maybe I'm gonna have to go down to a tip where a lot of artists from my industry have success and don't let that happen.
In the end, I would also like to see something more user-friendly that doesn’t cut off all creativity and energy from artists.
Declaration by the Donbase Workers' Party
The Union - yes, broken - no, they express their opinion in the image of the opponents of the breakup of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Belarusian Forest of December 8, 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Shuškevic, without any legal authority and violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open-minded attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “the Association of the SSR as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist”
With one cut of the pen, they \"removed - a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
Tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the Neruscan population of the former Soviet republics, we have lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who had destroyed what had been built in the past 70 years during one session in the Belarusian Forest have betrayed a socialist camp (created at the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
Consciously carried out deindustrialization, braked agriculture, cut off from the world’s largest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the population's weight loss, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as “the vacuum of force”
Everything that was betrayed and given up in haste quickly filled and conquered NATO countries that adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shocked today because of the events of the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a large-scale supermarket may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with it in the fridge and make it out on Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality in which I don’t buy meat on Monday, the chain will cut it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and that meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I will answer myself, nothing.
This talk about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, spoiled or poor quality are very retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now I've recently gone to Hlavas in Brno, and in the underdoor of the lady, they've been handing out a brochure, I always take things like this to help the brigadders, they can't shoot it...
Well, the brochure was full of Selian reason and conservative views about the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agit.
After reading, I found who published it and eventually came out of Scientology.
Well, like it was a good mattress, full of useless clues, like I'm supposed to be washed up and not fucked up.
It's a shame of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to be cut.
I had a similar experience with a former friend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to satisfy that person because you like him without realizing how much he is in this situation.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or if I wanted to leave her apartment before, she was crying and she asked me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
About a year ago it was a great relationship, but then it took another half a year and it started to squeez on the stick.
Then I ended up telling her I was breaking up and lying about it, but we can talk about it next week to calm it down and not catch some amok again.
Such a person exfoliates feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better stay away
When insurance companies are stolen from here by buying a cloud of tests and chasing positive ones who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is the complications for companies, carriers and others, because of the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell for five days of home imprisonment.
In the west, they stopped the shascara and recognized that it was not worth dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new, and it has to steal something and drive the ego by inventing the buking.
I look forward to having a good old snuff coming back.
After a few years of repressing and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back on duty again.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first-time at the University), the initial promise of training products and business skills quickly turned into - you may not be interested, especially get people -
I was really interested in the products I offered because I wanted to help people, but the trainings were more about how to scare and scare people.
When the first earning money came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to pick up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earning, or then a person felt like an underwater pot dealer.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, the person learned that he should not jump right on every spek and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or “fat” accounts.
In a corporation where I have not experienced many such things.
HR is calm, managers look at their management and don't push our nose too much.
Regular assessment, then, is happening in the form of what it is happening with us quite a bit (set some targets for the next year, look at what went wrong in a year) - it's more self-esteem than that someone would rate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate actions are also optional.
But we are also a little bit unique within our company - they are departments that are more - corporate -
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a early-starter who's quattling in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn’t work so much to bother us while the results are there.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days later, the British police searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With respect to the family, we will not share more information on the case.
Congratulations, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The last time they saw a young woman on November 28 on the bus on her way out of work, she was supposed to pick up cash from the ATM before she got in.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues from work five days later.
Then the London police began searching for her, and Interpol ranked her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested one man a few days ago.
What he had in the case played a role, and what he suspected, but did not publish.
At the end of the year, a new council was awarded in four municipalities.
On Saturday 11th December, a new representative was elected in Komňa village in Uherskohradistsk, Lužice on Mosteck, Nová Ves in Libereck and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has dropped under the law, or the number of representatives elected here has broken down.
In the new elections, there were 99 candidates in force.
The voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of the eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were awarded a mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years, the youngest 33 years.
A total of 13 candidate documents have been registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
There were 28 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year.
It held squares of new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, the very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which made greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, the 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
To deal with the fact that here we have quite a dangerous infectious disease at the very beginning it took me a while, but it went without bigger chills.
To deal with how stupidly a large part of the population is building on it on all its layers, I have a problem with it so far.
I look forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not cows.
He would be deprived of the office of the president and be able to regain it.
The chance that this will really happen is, as others say, very small.
In addition, I'm not sure if the carving of the file could be considered a betrayal at all.
Vezrada is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How The Pandemic Influenced Intimate Life: Grows the Number of People Under 35 Who Are Sexless All Year
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
These are mostly religiously based people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent.
A woman between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had no sexual intercourse in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, according to the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social media or video games could also have contributed, making sex less and less a priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 has been growing rapidly, saying they didn’t have sex in the previous year,” said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common in married people, with only 5% of them saying they have been without sex in the last year.
For free people, it was 29%, and Stone added that marriage under 35 was only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contributes to the loss of sexual activity.
Although it is more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 is still falling.
Young people share an opinion about premarital sex, about 30% think it’s a bad thing, while about 70% think it’s okay.
“It’s true that among the free individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting this trend,” Stone said.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, religious foundation is the reason.
Since 2008, for free people under the age of 35 who have participated in religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the “less believers”, the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as fewer social interactions and, in particular, the social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is less in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, replacing this need.
This trend was mainly caught as a lockdown at the time of the coronavir pandemic.
The whole of ordering covid vaccination is about whether society should force some of the population to behave that they don’t want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question that I personally care about the issue of social conscience.
For example, if we don’t order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that for the death of an 80-year-old who didn’t know much, we didn’t explain well to him, heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn’t get vaccinated and finally caught and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who here, alongside the SPD and the KSC, has a bit of bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will actually be able to do so themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign in the fight against drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest pieces of snow in recent years.
Ski area operators will not do without technical snow, the weather will also make it more difficult to prepare the Jizerská 50s.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not a pancake.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across the city to the yard, so that we could ride on boats across the river.
On the way there we went once such a wide street, and who we do not see in the middle - the adherent of Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they've fallen on us.
Thankfully, I ran away, but with one friend they got in touch.
When she left, she and her teacher asked her what she had told them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul,” she replied.
All of us, including our teacher, laughed all the way to the yard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already falling, says Orozovich
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honour.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, is a good decision by the Chancellor to use diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the “Norman group”, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the chancellor informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, because we record hundreds of attempts at crossing borders every night.
The Chancellor discussed further sanctions to ensure that Lukashenko’s regime and his patrons in the Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with runners.
Drunk Polish religious man has caused an accident, trying to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When police told her that she could still lose a driving license in the event of a driving accident, she came out with the truth out, TVN24 said.
She admitted that she had encountered another nun in the car who had asked her for help.
The police came for Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to a breath test, and after they found out that she had more than two Promile in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess her actions in court.
The dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovich did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedy have seen American stories about dog lovers.
But they forgot the important thing: the lawfulness of the film craft.
Following F. Brabce Gump, a dog who taught people how to live, we are watching another picture here.
The co-author of the screenplay and the director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely follows up on his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
The stage is returned to the speaking Jesuit Hugo and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava pension, who is going to die, and so they will begin to invite him, Julia's father and her partner, and mostly her daughter, Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences the first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) were faced with the procedures of storytelling already in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that provokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of embarrassingness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to darker mistakes in his desire for a child and, if a proper “constelation” comes, he is collapsing with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined, on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), a well-deserved Colonel Mojmir, despite his flight training, will shoot his own daughter (Julia), who falls into a coma, and then the family is taken away from the hospital, so that a miraculous healing process of a dog can take place in the heart of the Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the purgatory treatment of nature and the power of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, wonders what content pellets full of untrustworthy situations and figures were needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, competition for narrators, Šumava sharlatan, police officers coming to the show to look for \"drugs - and discussing herbs about the fertilizer power of bone flour - and which a baked family in the pension will, of course, be drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and sits on anondulated and painted with a cigar at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and flippers as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
At the top, viewers explain that “this sometimes happens after a coma”
Shejmovich’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of work with text, ability to put forward a supporting situation, a feeling for the characters and the point characters and the directorial leadership.
The acting performances are unbalanced, cut helpless, and the overall impression is obscured.
Although Lukáš Vaculik, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to stand their party, they have too much to play.
The only pros of the film remain poetic images of the Shumava nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of Jesavcians.
It is not enough to outline several characters, cottage plots and dog heads, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that characters do.
It is not even an argument to be a member of the Club of Dwarf Breeders - as in the case of a producer.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with a dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a reliable story.
That didn't work in this case.
There is a little bit of eroticism and a minimal feeling for the genre.
Even as an ad for canistherapy, this amateur piece wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, 'cause they have to listen to constant abuses right from fools like you.
There's a difference between offer and coercion, here's how you understand shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn’t want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened like that, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which it's a job for a earnings gig.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“Almost the complete absence of precipitation during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual,” the Israeli meteorological service said.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average.
This week’s two-day rain was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scenery, the inhabitants of Nazareth were pleased by Wasim Ashkar.
The precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are impacting and irregular.
In winter there are dependent forests.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about supplies of drinking water and water for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilean Lake, was filled to the edge this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Waterowners have warned against drought a long time ago.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be precipitation,” Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israeli Water Management Office, said in a statement.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
The mountains are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are additional tank cars.
The pipes and private wells dry out.
“Letos has increased my orders by 70 to 80 percent compared to two previous years,” said Imad Sulejman, a tank car driver in September.
There were conflicts between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The river was completely free of water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military intervention against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the talks in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and that he informed Washington about the preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., is trying to convince Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also told Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring \"no progress\" and world powers \"understand that the Iranians are playing with them.\"
About three years ago, this happened to me.
I liked the girl a little bit and grilled in the conversation to find out what she wanted me to do.
I finally found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these submersibles, I've been in doubt and question for a while, and I've finally thanked and left.
Well, just tell me I'm sorry, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, there was plenty of snow and good weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic have experienced the first major skier attack this weekend.
After heavy snow at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have started operation.
The downhiller did not dissuade the obligation to prove itself on the lifts with a covid certificate.
While lifters do not complain about the interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country ski trails and ski slopes on the weekend.
Skiers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are happy that the opening weekend has really come out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill,” said Jakub Hanuš, the director of the Jested Sport Area.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky during the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlovy Vary or the Branné resort in Šumpersk was opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, and today there were an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are superstitious.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not save by praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Ski operators can only sell ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after the disease is caused by covid-19.
Except for the exceptions, people are ready for it and prove the necessary documents, said ČTK René Hroneszeš from the ski center Špindlerův Mlyn.
“We only recorded incident units,” he added.
A lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rental companies and shops.
Fortunately, the interest in ski rental is.
It’s not like in recent years, but there’s still a lot of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from Skiopava in Opava.
A greater impact is expected during ski courses.
Also, the head of the Royal Garden Company Snowbear David Shinták feels that due to the covid, there is no such interest in lending ski equipment as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
According to him, the people with the pandemic have become lenient and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the great demand is recorded by the rental company in Novako on God’s Gift.
Ski rental started there a week ago and the participants must order them now in advance.
“We start borrowing this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Novaková, the operator of the complex.
The interest that is comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or doctor a specialist.
Smart and smart people go abroad who have no property.
The owner of the company is not going to go abroad.
With the rest, absolutely consent.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not simply live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban one beautiful day, the year ruled and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
Another question is the election at all.
If he lives here stupidly, he can also win some traditional V4's madman.
Young and educated people will leave, their supporters will remain, and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Awesome photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic he was in full swing of autumn, in Thailand, the crew of the film Island headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of the face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a picture?
The London Police are still searching for the missing Czech Republic.
She was last seen on her way home.
“The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all, and we’re starting to worry about her,” said Lucy O’Connor, a police department in Lambeth, where Srnc worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and she just wants to know where she is,” she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, at around 19:45, and headed home to Camberwell.
She was reportedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srnc, according to the British media, served as the assistant nurse of Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague, Peter, who is missing,” a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
The public also calls for cooperation by Mr Harriet Harman, who on Saturday pointed out the case of Srncová at a press conference.
“She’s been missing for a few days, she’s only 32 years old, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, worried about death,” a Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel that we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and worked here for our health services,” Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news site, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
This is not how I underestimate Ukraine.
These are not huge amounts, but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and starting to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted the war.
War is fucking expensive fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can compare this with the first Punic war and the “anexy” of Sicily.
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it is not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That’s all, and that “concentration” at the border would match that.
Yes, Pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague since Sunday, mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, especially regarding suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now involved in the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday they stop the speeds from Ceske Budejovice in the Garden City station.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains, which travel from Beroun to České Brod by the Prague Main Station, will take off.
In the recently established Prague-Zahradní Město station, the R17 from Czech Budejovice and Benesov will be stopped again.
PID is expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go up to Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Starý Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladoboleslavsk will be integrated, including lines with a cross-section to the Liberec and Kralovehradice region.
77 lines will be cancelled during integration, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will leave Prague Zličín, which will travel to Žatce.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice was also established, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
They will be sent in the morning peak and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovníka, when the express line number 404 will be released.
New lines 400 and 410 flying to Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They leave the metro station Střížkov, not the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The 400 line goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lipa to New Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Miměno and Jablonné in Podještěd.
On the contrary, the operation of ten local routes in Central Bohemia is cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál under Třemsín.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Cologne.
Changes are waiting for passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or expand the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a follow-up from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevska.
The routes between 540 and 543 in Nymbursk have changed and some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region are adjusted.
Healthy snack / lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I do not have the power to exercise, I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I will buy the maximum pizza butter and yogurt and apple.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to me in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
This is not the trees you need to see.
Under the snow can hide only the tip of the tree.
If destroyed, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason they're banning us from driving off the pistes, but it's one of them.
Donation of the Gifts on the Relationship with Nedved: I wasn’t really happy about this
On Friday, the Czech show business pond has lived nothing but by revealing the relationship of Dary Rollins and Pavel Nedved.
They've been pulling it together for years, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara now sent the fans an extensive message explaining why she had been hiding love from them for half a year.
“I would like to say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has escaped that Dara has caught a bear, i.e., a pardon, Nedvěda,” jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we didn’t both enjoy, but we knew that one day it would happen, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse at it.
If those who do not care about it and jump on it from the canned, or we whose lives dispel it in detail.
As if any of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you are good enough with your husband or girlfriend, or if you insisted that everyone really knows the list of your former partners and are familiar with the calculation of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, you don't mind, Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins was driving for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
He is a former vice president of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth only now because they were waiting for the completion of Nedved's divorce.
They have been separated with Ivana’s wife for three years, but they are not only three weeks in paper.
To those who rejoice with us and wish us, thank you.
We too are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and like him, I stand by him, and in good and bad, Rolins shut up.
Hi, the other commentators have probably already said everything, I'm just confirming that the tracks are great to the beginning, my classmates usually met during the first semester or two, and they've found the rents together, which will come as the best option for me, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments usually don’t advertise too long ahead, so you probably won’t find much now, but looking at the offer will definitely not hurt you.
Otherwise, certainly avoid not only Cejla, but also the surrounding area (the streets such as Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is a lot of student, the King's field and in that direction it's fine, in addition, it's close to most VUT faculty (I don't know exactly where you're going).
So I've never been looking for a rental, but I'm a native Brňák, so maybe I can consult Brno as if you still have some information missing :)
This is an example of ‘normal’ thinking.
Due to what has been decided to do by several doctors somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite okay that the state does not adequately finance certain schools.
Whether they teach what they want and pay for it from their own or whether they go by state and pay the state.
After all, we can’t let a private actor master a piece of education just because he’ll throw a few crowns at a full-fledged state contribution and he’ll be able to teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a claim is somewhat lost when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed in this way about a petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the voice against if someone goes to an abortion is the same for you as a voice against a statue standing in the square?
I'd like to consult you directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise I have already experienced in cataloging/digitalization that (even long-term professionals) it either fits from the eye or write something on the way xxx *** or ... (by convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, it's quite readable in this case, so I wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd sort of deal with it in a note based on what kind of program you're using.
If you'd like to be a good student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd suggest that the author or printer simply created his own character, which sits at what's physically on that coin.
PS: Is it more like the Odry Kingdom than the OdryN?
PSS: Someone's broken up.
Take a look at this comment
Politicians do not even know what will be “the subject” of our presidency.
This is much worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something, because no one understood any text, is smiling.
All the important approved documents are being examined by word from word, for this, just as some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions; English is more suited for informal relations, for above-standard relations.
In addition, with the English it is quite interesting, after GB’s exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hat on Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10am and never have a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who hasn't come in in his life.
Yeah, there's probably most of the Roma population in Brno, but all they do is stop them from walking on the pavement and parking where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'd be afraid to climb the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd be fine.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dad and her lover Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who will spend Christmas with?
On Sunday most people on the Advent wreath lit the first candle, Felix Slovenček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw the gifts of the wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, said to the saxophonist, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dad remains alone after his departure.
He still doesn’t know where he’s going to be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIEW: Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelemová: AWAYS COLLECTION!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together!
But we kept talking about something, so it wasn't Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'm going to buy something for Dad and Lucie.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the baptism of a music video to Richman's club.
I'm alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Human Saturday Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot so that he wouldn't occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few police officers and they can’t afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else so high a percentage of medically trained people aren’t at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend the wrong Ostrava goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, she has been asking for new toys for quite a long time.
Record dryness in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic has been undergoing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters have fallen in mountain and mountainous areas, with a smaller sum of precipitation also recording places where there has been no need for moisture.
The cause of drought, which prevails in a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the impact also strengthens the way we deal with the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with dryness?
How can nature help in difficult times?
Yeah, it's going to be, I'm barely keeping myself in ice skates, I know how to play hockey, and the tactics I've tried at Franchise Hockey Manager is also a total haluz.
And whether you're a hockey team -the bear of Russia -or the lama of China -so lose two goals even if you don't have to win the match at all costs is different than when it's compared.
But anyway, what I listen to by Czech commentators, what the referees do not notice, whether male or female hockey, is all strange, but that is so probably with all sports, UEFA and “Italian actors”, or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the opposite as it always was, and that the Czech Republic had already lost more often than it had won, it would probably have been a classic “outside” vs. “we have won”
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 for 100 000, 871 for 100 000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death rate since the end of October.
Britain faces a “inevitable” large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser for the British Health Safety Authority said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron infected people are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
No one has died of omicron yet, but hospitalization occurs about 14 days after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour chief Keira Starmer said Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by having a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when it was introduced lockdown and were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz was “virtual” over the computer.
However, he was involved in the Downing Street group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure on Johnson’s removal from premier office is increasing.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers held numerous events despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV Commercial Television Editor for Britain: Boris Johnson won the general election two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party talks about the need to remove him from office as Prime Minister.
Notable how fast the events have developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in spring, which may end the 12-year government of Viktor Orban.
It will be elections of European importance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free, because these were not even the last two elections under Orban.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and makes more or less tricks.
The last one is that everyone can vote where they want to be.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from the decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying they won't be fair at all.
Do you think this will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It was earlier, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
That's a big habit for Viktor Orban and his side.
Will they not try to keep playing harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a record of the president and one of Fidesz’s leaders, László Kövér, has escaped into independent media, explaining that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these signs of a new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those news.
It all starts with language.
I’ve been beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mother’s parents don’t have much patience, neither do I, my dad has a long time, but then bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a little terrible, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a bush and being all blue, I was about 2 times taken under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes my education broke, sometimes it was more like they didn’t know anymore.
I also have a tendency to deal with things by violence now, as I was a little girl, now at least to get into something, and as a younger parent, I was crying through my hand, for example (so that I didn’t get too much over the handle), so I never get anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent this is my explosiveity, but it certainly has its share in education.
I'm afraid I'll lose my patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think it’s just wrong to beat children and that my parents shouldn’t have done it, especially not at the time when it wasn’t “teaching,” but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks something, it’s probably not possible for their children to at least not give up, so I don’t blame them.
It doesn't hurt me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and clear.
So I would call the Kundami those who make laws in such quality.
I wonder if you’re not afraid of an outage?
Can you really count on people to want and buy the product and you will have what to pay for the mortgage?
The cute world of Kočner.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the killers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with four defendants charged with the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connection to the tips of Slovak politics and justice.
How will the process for Slovakia mean a major evil?
Journalists are hugely responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an orderly greater media attention than the petitions of the dean of all medical faculties that came out on a day, two later?
They got crazy and the company jumped away.

Another government ends and the law on involving municipalities in the choice of storage nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlíček needs to be substantially reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrei Babiš is over, and the law, which was meant to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after the years.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against deep storage, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect a stronger strengthening of their capabilities in decision-making about the storage area, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by Czech atomic law and European directives.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition treaty, to redefine the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law by Minister Karl Havlíček, who has the Platform at his disposal, refers in particular to the municipalities: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if the community or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all.
This can be ensured by imposing a storage management obligation to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal of a substantive intention almost completely overlooks the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in the course of authorisation proceedings.
The design lacks system-wide compensation settings for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, its authorisation and operation.
In fact, according to today’s legal norms, representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for storage.
Only in certain licensing procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the Office or the Minister shall decide in whose interest it is authorised to issue them.
Any action shall not have a undue effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The co-deciding of the self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemanek.
The total amount for these works is expected to amount to almost 4 million crowns according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknicka, Deputy Mayor of the village of Cejle from Hrádek and spokesperson of the Platform against the Deep Storage, said: “After ministers of industry who have only shifted the position of self-government towards state authorities in search of a deep storage of highly radioactive wastes to their successors, we expect a more significant turnover from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a crucial construction as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The anti-deep storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state’s approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited only to deep storage.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced fear to lose weight: He threw 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything in his lifestyle for many years, he was finally scared by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Frey Brothers.
The thickness of the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put everything in my mouth,” the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, he told ABC Goodman whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and what you want to use the word ‘boss’.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were formal and maybe higher education, I might be looking for a boss to describe or explain.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc. has a few bosses that, yes, and so is 'boss' something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who are not at all needed to beat so that the game or level is completed, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not deal with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called at all?
And then they're mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in a one-off way, but it is not possible for Czech and other languages to solve it (an interesting thing is just Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, adversary stronger than any previous and watchful completion of a level or task.
Peter of London is searching for the whole world.
The Czech police were also involved.
The British police have been searching for Peter Srnc since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradisk has been searching since December 7th.
Through Interpol, she also helps the British police.
The Czechs saw Peter Srnc last seen her colleagues on November 28.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol has released the so-called yellow orbiter.
Peter is searching for the whole world.
“The Czech police work closely with the British police,” police spokesman Katerina Rendl said.
“We share information on the case,” she added.
The search for Peter has already appeared on the police site.
According to him, 168 centimeters tall, is thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues worry about her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
Mr Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in hanging out leaflets with Petra's face.
“We are very worried about it,” she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
But it is not clear who he was and what he had in common with Petra.
The Czech Republic is terrorizing Tesla Agent.
While data showed a slight decline in attack campaigns in October, attacks increased significantly with the approaching end of the year last month.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with the Tesla agent on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected email attachment should draw attention to the name that refers to payments and financial transactions in the user.
While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the account repair for 11,2021...exe,” said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored logins, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike the Tesla agent, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook most often included an attachment with the .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The Annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and suppression of activity is recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which cost 1.6% of attacks and in the Czech Republic had no major attack campaign in recent months.
Today's demo of smarts who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
Prague was bigger than the media said.
According to the images of the parade on the waterfront, and according to my experience, the demonstrator is not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
People in the guide filled the waterfront with a bridge and opposite waterfront communication.
This means that people really do a lot.
About 4,000 demonstrators spontaneously add unprecedented numbers of passers-by.

That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or classes of the population led to the finding of common speech.
Only the anti-vaxers themselves, the anti-russers and the company would not be able to fill or pay such a large procession.
The events of the Association of Chípl dog have increasing popularity, reminding me of a million moments for democracy in the face.
Sometimes I have the impression that they rent the same podium and technique.
It’s hard to say what kind of movement you can pay off from this dissatisfaction depends not only on the money supply, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a square and more dose.
It's definitely not the left or middle movement, bet it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become multidose, as it is obvious that we will have to let ourselves be re-vaccinated every half year.
I'm glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant actions of scientists on whom humanity is rightly proud.
The end of the heel, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has ordered the establishment of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement to continue the change that won the November election.
It has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the last government under the burden of anti-corruption protests lost the election.
However, the winning parties declaring the fight against bribery and abuse of power failed to agree, so two more premature elections followed.

In Britain, concerns about the fate of 32-year-old Czechs have been growing on the weekend, after which London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
She calls for information about a child hospital worker, in addition to the police and her current employer or a member representing a part of London where she lived.
“The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all, and we’re starting to worry about her,” said Lucy O’Connor, a police department in Lambeth, where Srnc worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and she just wants to know where she is,” she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, at around 19:45, and headed home to Camberwell.
She was reportedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srnc, according to the British media, served as the assistant nurse of Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague, Peter, who is missing,” a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.

In Usti nad Labem, the Zela Month hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The Magistrate referred to complaints about the RSD, whose road belongs, and because it said it did not respond, a hole of Zela continued.
